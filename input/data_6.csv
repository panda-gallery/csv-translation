Britain's defense minister resigns in growing harassment scandal,"LONDON (Reuters) - British defense minister Michael Fallon quit on Wednesday, the first resignation in a growing sexual harassment scandal that  prompted calls for a wholesale change in the  locker room  culture in parliament. Members of Prime Minister Theresa May s Conservative Party said the first high-profile resignation in the scandal showed it was time for reform at the 800-year-old parliament, where power is concentrated in lawmakers  hands and wielded, often unchecked, over junior aides. The loss of Fallon, described by Conservative sources as a political  Rottweiler , leaves May with a hole in her cabinet, already at odds on everything from Britain s departure from the European Union to the government s austerity agenda. Weakened after losing her party s majority in a June election, May will want to move swiftly to appoint a replacement with as little disruption as possible. In his letter of resignation to May, Fallon, who had apologized earlier this week for repeatedly touching a radio presenter s knee in 2002, said there had been many allegations about lawmakers, including  some about my previous conduct .  Many of these have been false but I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the armed forces that I have the honor to represent,  he said, offering no detail on the nature of any other allegations.  I have reflected on my position and I am therefore resigning as defense secretary.  May replied in a letter saying she appreciated  the characteristically serious manner  in which Fallon had considered his position and  the particular example you wish to set to servicemen and women and others . The prime minister was expected to announce a new defense minister on Thursday and is unlikely to launch a major reshuffle of her cabinet at a time when she is trying to push forward Brexit talks. Dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party for a majority in parliament, May will be keen to try to limit the fallout of the scandal, which has prompted allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct against lawmakers across parliament. Sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein have prompted hundreds of thousands of women and men to share stories about improper behavior and Britain s parliament - a bastion of tradition - has been no exception. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, said it was time to break with a culture in politics when powerful people  use positions of power to demand things from others .  The dam has broken on this now, and these male-dominated professions where the boys-own locker room culture has prevailed and it s all been a bit of a laugh, has got to stop,  she told the BBC. Allegations of sexual abuse have ranged from a charge of rape by an activist in the opposition Labour Party by a senior party member, to unconfirmed details of serial  sex pests  on a list reportedly drafted by aides and researchers in parliament. On Monday, May sat beside the leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom as she set out the government s plans to tackle sexual harassment, including measures to enforce a code of conduct and to set up an independent grievance procedure. May has ordered investigations into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys and an allegation her deputy, Damian Green, made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman - something he denies. The prime minister, who has long championed the careers of female lawmakers, said on Wednesday that action would be taken when there were allegations and evidence of sexual misconduct.  I am very clear that we will take action against those where there are allegations that we see, and the evidence is there, that there has been misconduct,  May told lawmakers.

Scottish lawmakers call for international recognition for Catalan independence,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Pro-independence Scottish lawmakers have presented a motion in their devolved parliament urging international recognition of Catalonia s unilateral declaration of independence from Spain, putting pressure on Scotland s leader to endorse the movement. Scotland s pro-independence First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has criticized Madrid s handling of the crisis with its northern region but refrained from backing the declaration. The European Union, which she would like to see admitting a future independent Scotland, has backed Spain s central government. According to the website of the Scottish parliament, the lawmakers  motion called on  the international community to recognize the vote of the Catalan parliament for an independent republic of Catalonia . Catalonia declared independence unilaterally last week after holding a vote banned under Spain s constitution. Spain has since sacked the autonomous Catalan government and called regional elections. The motion was signed by 21 of the 63 lawmakers in the Scottish National Party which runs the devolved government in Scotland. It was also signed by one lawmaker from the Scottish Greens but is unlikely to go further as it requires support from three parties to be debated in the Scottish parliament. The move, aimed at drawing attention to the Catalan situation, comes amid nervousness about the future of Scotland s stalled independence drive, which still has the support of around 45 percent of voters, according to polls. Some nationalists last month called on First Minister Sturgeon, who has made comments in support of Catalonia and its right to self-determination, to recognize Catalonia s independence, but to no avail.   We cannot recognize Catalan independence because, much as we would like to be, we are not a sovereign state,  a Scottish government source said at the time. The Times reported on Thursday that the Catalan breakaway government had asked for support from the Scottish government but received no reply. The Scottish government could not immediately be reached for comment. Sturgeon s Scottish National Party lost one third of its seats in a June election for Britain s national party in London, and has blamed the mistiming of a fresh drive for an independence referendum for the result. Scots rejected independence by a 10-percentage point margin in 2014 but Britain s vote to leave the European Union has exposed fresh divisions in the United Kingdom. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU, while Wales and England voted to leave. ",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",1
Arrest warrant for ex-Catalan leader 'normal' if he doesn't testify: Supreme court,"MADRID (Reuters) - If the ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont fails to appear in court, the normal procedure would be to issue an arrest warrant, the president of Spain s Supreme Court said on Thursday.   When someone doesn t appear after being cited by a judge to testify, in Spain or any other EU country, normally an arrest warrant is issued,  Supreme Court President Carlos Lesmes said. Puigdemont said on Wednesday he would ignore a court order to return to Spain to answer charges over the region s push for independence. He did not turn up at a High Court hearing on Thursday.

Moscow hopes Syrian opposition will attend Russia-backed congress: Ifax,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia hopes that all Syrian opposition groups will attend a Moscow-backed Syrian congress in southern Russia on Nov. 18 despite some objections, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said on Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported. The event, called the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue, was first mentioned by President Vladimir Putin last month who said he believed that militants in Syria would soon be defeated. It is due to be held in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.  But while Damascus has backed the Russian plan, some opposition groups have rejected the idea, calling it an attempt to rehabilitate President Bashar al-Assad s government. They have said they will stick to U.N.-brokered Geneva peace talks. Asked if Moscow still hoped to see opposition groups like the High Negotiations Committee, which has refused to come, attending, Interfax cited Bogdanov as saying:  We hope that everyone who believes that the fate of the country, its unity, its territorial integrity and its sovereignty are important will participate.

Syrian opposition: Russia conference aims to rehabilitate Assad,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The main Syrian opposition body said on Thursday a Russian-sponsored Syrian peace conference later this month represented a deviation from U.N.-led diplomacy and an attempt to rehabilitate President Bashar al-Assad s government.  We, in the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), insist on rejecting discussion of Syria s future outside the legal, U.N. framework,  the HNC said in a statement sent to Reuters.

Russia wants $2 billion from Turkey for S-400 air defense missiles: TASS,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has sold its advanced S-400 air defense missile system to Turkey for over $2 billion, Sergei Chemezov, the head of state conglomerate Rostec, said on Thursday, the TASS news agency reported. The deal with Turkey, a NATO member, has caused some disquiet in the United States. Turkey originally awarded a $3.4 billion contract for a defense system to China in 2013, but canceled that two years later, saying it would concentrate on developing a system domestically.

China's Xi says hopes to promote relations with North Korea: KCNA,"SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un s congratulatory message on China s Communist Party Congress, saying he hopes to promote ties between the two countries, North Korea s state news agency said on Thursday. The friendly exchange is relatively routine, but it comes as China has come under intense pressure from the United States to do more to rein in the North s missile and nuclear tests, which have raised tensions globally. China has been increasingly frustrated over ally North Korea s weapons tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions, repeatedly calling for restraint and urging all sides to speak and act carefully. Xi s message comes days before U.S. President Donald Trump makes his first official visit to Asia, with North Korea high on the agenda. It follows Tuesday s unexpected agreement between Seoul and Beijing to move beyond a year-long dispute over the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea.  I wish that under the new situation, the Chinese side would make efforts with the DPRK side to promote relations between the two parties and the two countries to sustainable soundness and stable development and thus make a positive contribution to ... defending regional peace and stability and common prosperity,  Xi wrote in the message dated Nov. 1, according to the North s official news agency KCNA. DPRK stands for the Democratic People s Republic of Korea, North Korea s official name. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not give details of the message from Xi to Kim but confirmed it had been sent to express thanks for Kim s congratulatory messages. Many countries had sent messages to China over the congress and, to be polite, China had written back to say thank you to them, she added.  I believe this is in the interests of both sides and has important meaning for resolving the present problem we are facing and maintaining regional peace and stability,  Hua told a daily news briefing in Beijing. The message had yet to be carried by Chinese state media as of Thursday afternoon. China and North Korea often exchange diplomatic correspondence and ceremonial letters, although personal messages between the leaders tend to be few. Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said the exchange of messages appeared  totally routine , while noting that Kim s congratulatory message was shorter than one sent after the previous Communist Party congress five years ago, when Xi first came to power. After a flurry of activity including a sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3, Pyongyang did not disrupt last month s party congress with another test as some analysts had expected. It has not tested a missile since launching one over Japan on Sept. 15, the longest such lull this year. But Zhao said this was likely due to  technical reasons rather than political reasons .  There are no signs that they are going to give up on additional missile or nuclear tests,  he said. Nam Seong-wook, a professor of North Korea Studies at Korea University in Seoul, said Xi s reply to Kim could be interpreted as  China s strategic ambition to embrace both North Korea and South Korea  ahead of Trump s visits to South Korea and China.  Xi has previously sent messages to Kim, most recently last year when Xi expressed his congratulations for a party congress in North Korea. Neither leader has visited the other s country since assuming power. Kim sent a congratulatory message to Xi last week at the end of China s Communist Party Congress, wishing him  great success  as head of the nation. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Niger defense minister asks U.S. to deploy armed drones against militants," (This Nov. 1 story refiles to fix typo in author s name) By Tim Cocks and Abdoulaye Massalatchi NIAMEY (Reuters) - Niger has asked the United States to start using armed drones against jihadist groups operating on the Mali border, raising the stakes in a counter-insurgency campaign jolted by a deadly ambush of allied U.S.-Nigerien forces.       On Oct. 4, Islamist militants with sniper rifles and rocket propelled grenades killed four U.S. soldiers and at least four of their Nigerien partners in an ambush that exposed the dangers of an expanding U.S. presence in the largely desert nation.     What began as a small U.S. training operation has expanded to an 800-strong force that accompanies the Nigeriens on intelligence gathering and other missions. It includes a $100million drone base in the central Nigerien city of Agadez which, however, at present only deploys surveillance drones.      I asked them some weeks ago to arm them (the drones) and use them as needed,  Defence Minister Kalla Mountari told Reuters in an interview in his office. Asked if Washington had accepted the request, he said:  Our enemies will find out.      The deaths of the U.S. soldiers, at the hands of suspected insurgents with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara group, shocked Americans, many of whom did not realize their country had such a large presence in Africa s Sahel region. The incident also highlighted the  mission creep  that has set in and expanded the U.S. role in landlocked Niger, one of the world s poorest and most insecure countries.      Mountari said the team of 12 U.S. Special Forces soldiers  and 30 Nigerien troops had been  right up to the Mali border and had neutralized some bandits  just before the ambush took place. He declined to give further details. The U.S. military has been adamant that the Oct. 3-4 mission was not intended to involve contact with enemy forces. Mountari said:  They (U.S.-Nigerien contingent) came back to Niger, they greeted the population, they gathered intelligence and it was inside the country, when they didn t expect anything, that the attack happened.      U.S. forces do not have a direct combat mission in Niger, but their assistance to its military does include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in their efforts to target violent Islamist organizations.    However, Mountari was clear he saw them as close partners.      The Americans are not just exchanging information with us. They are waging war when necessary,  he said.      We are working hand in hand. The clear proof is that the Americans and Nigeriens fell on the battlefield for the peace and security of our country.       But a growing U.S. role in Niger could prove unpopular both with Americans, many of whom are tired of costly and sometimes deadly foreign adventures, and in Niger, whose citizens have mixed feelings about foreign forces on their soil.     Drone strikes have been controversial in other parts of the world because of the risk of civilian casualties. At a protest rally over a domestic political issue on Sunday, dozens of demonstrators also began chanting against the presence of foreign troops in Niger, a Reuters witness said.

Filipino lawyers' group challenges Duterte's war on drugs,"MANILA (Reuters) - Filipino lawyers on Thursday announced a broad alliance to challenge President Rodrigo Duterte s 16-month war on drugs amid unprecedented scrutiny of the campaign in which more than 3,900 mostly urban, poor Filipinos have been killed. Police say the deaths were in self-defense after armed suspects resisted arrest. Critics dispute that and say executions are taking place, with zero accountability. Lawyers Against Extrajudicial Killings adds to a growing number of voices calling on the government to end the campaign.  It is the duty of all lawyers to consistently, uncompromisingly uphold and defend human rights,  said Edre Olalia, head of the National Union of People s Lawyers and one of the group s organizers.  Duterte s spokesman, Harry Roque, a congressman and human rights lawyer, denied rights violations on the part of the president but welcomed the new group.   Unless we can come up with actual evidence that there are extra-legal killings, then we cannot overcome the presumption (of regularity in the discharge of official functions),  Roque said.  He (Duterte) will not tolerate murders. He will only tolerate killings when it is in line with duty and when the engagement is legal,  Roque, who had prosecuted on behalf of murdered journalists, told reporters.

Actor Russell Crowe criticizes Australian bid to move asylum seekers,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The 600 asylum seekers barricaded inside an abandoned detention center in Papua New Guinea without food or running water are Australia s  shame , Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe said on Thursday, offering to house six of the detainees. For two days, the men in the Manus Island Centre have  defied efforts by Australia and Papua New Guinea to close the camp, saying they fear violence from the local community if they are moved elsewhere. The stand-off was a  disgrace,  the star of the films  Gladiator  and  Les Mis rables  told his 2.7 million followers in a series of messages on social network Twitter.  I believe I could house and find jobs for six,  Crowe tweeted.  I m sure there d be other Australians who would do the same.  The stand-off has prompted condemnation, particularly from bodies such as the United Nations, though Crowe s intervention could spotlight the issue at a time when some detainees are showing the ill-effects of having no food for two days. A spokeswoman for Australia s immigration minister Peter Dutton refused to comment. She said there had been no change in the government s policy of refusing to allow any asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach Australian shores, and detaining them instead in camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru in the South Pacific. The issue will be a key element of talks between Australia s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern on Sunday in Sydney. Ardern has said a 2013 offer by former Prime Minister John Key to resettle 150 refugees held in Australian detention centers remains on the table. Crowe, a New Zealand citizen who has lived in Australia for many years, received the Best Actor award of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2001, for his performance in  Gladiator .

Inquiry ordered into deadly Indian power plant blast,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian authorities on Thursday ordered an inquiry to determine within seven days the cause of a blast at a coal-fired power plant that killed 26 people and injured more than 100   one of the country s worst industrial accidents in years. More than 20 survivors were battling for life with severe burn injuries following Wednesday s blast at the 1,550-megawatt plant operated by state-owned NTPC in northern Uttar Pradesh state, state officials said. Arvind Kumar, a principal secretary, said some of the severely injured had been taken to a hospital in the state capital Lucknow.  Blockages in the flue gas pipe in a unit led to the blast. Hot flue gases and steam let out by the blast severely injured several workers,  Sanjay Kumar Khatri, the top government official of Rae Bareli district where the plant is located, told Reuters on Thursday.  A magisterial inquiry has been initiated. This two-member technical team will submit findings within seven days,  Khatri said. NTPC is the country s top power producer and accidents have been rare at its facilities. Senior state police official Anand Kumar said in a statement posted online on Wednesday that ash had piled up in the furnace beneath the boiler, which led to building up of pressure resulting in the explosion. The state government has offered cash compensation of 200,000 rupees ($3,097) to the families of the deceased, 50,000 rupees for the severely injured and half of that to those who sustained minor injuries, Khatri said. The plant in the town of Unchahar supplies electricity to nine states, NTPC s website showed. But the company said other facilities would make up for the shortfall and outages were unlikely. The 500 MW unit, where the mishap occurred, had been operating since April and is under shut down after the accident. The other five units of the station are operating normally, NTPC said in a statement.  This is most unfortunate. NTPC has initiated an inquiry into the incident. We are not a company that will take any risk. We have so many units that if power cannot be supplied by one, it can be given by the other. It was a sudden accident,  an NTPC official, who did not wish to be quoted, said. ",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",1
Iraq threatens to resume military operations against Kurds,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces threatened on Wednesday to resume operations to capture northern Kurdish-held territory after accusing authorities there of delaying handing over control of Iraq s borders with Turkey, Iran and Syria. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Friday declared a pause in an offensive that began on Oct. 16 to take over areas claimed both by his government and the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Abadi ordered economic and military retaliation against the KRG after Iraqi Kurds voted for independence in September in a referendum that Baghdad declared illegal. He said the truce was meant to allow Iraqi troops to deploy without hindrance in the disputed areas and at the international borders. Kurdish officials said on Tuesday they were willing to allow Iraqi  oversight  at the border but said the KRG had to remain in control of crossings into the Kurdish region.  The Iraqi Joint Operations Command accused the KRG of using the talks to  buy time  in order to strengthen Kurdish lines.  During the negotiations, the (Kurdish) region was moving its forces and building new defenses,  the Iraqi statement said.  We will not allow it; the federal forces are mandated to secure (the disputed) areas and borders.  The Kurdish Peshmerga fighters  command accused Iraqi forces of massing weapons and threatening force to resolve  domestic political differences.  Iraq s entire land border with Turkey is located inside the Kurdish autonomous region, and has been controlled by the Kurds since before the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Iraqis troops on Tuesday set up positions between the Turkish and the Iraqi Kurdish checkpoints at the Habur border crossing between the Turkish town of Silopi and the Iraqi town of Zakho. That meant vehicles crossing the border were subject to three checks. Control of the border area is of crucial importance for the landlocked Kurdish region. An oil pipeline runs from northern Iraq into Turkey, carrying crude exports which are the Kurds  in principal source of funds. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
One in five Indonesian students support Islamic caliphate: survey,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Nearly 20 percent of high school and university students in Indonesia support the establishment of a caliphate in the world s largest Muslim-majority country over the current secular government, a new survey showed this week. Indonesia has in recent years seen its long-standing reputation for religious tolerance come under scrutiny as hardline Islamic groups muscle their way into public and political life in the young democracy.     The vast majority of Indonesians practice a moderate form of Islam and the country has sizeable minorities of Hindus, Christians, and people who adhere to traditional beliefs. Religious diversity is enshrined in its constitution.      The survey by a Jakarta-based organization polled over 4,200 Muslim students, mostly in top schools and universities on Java island, home to over half the country s population. Nearly one in four students said they were, to varying degrees, ready to wage jihad to achieve a caliphate.  This indicates that intolerant teachings have already entered top universities and high schools,  pollster Alvara, which carried out the survey, said in its report released Tuesday.  The government and moderate Islamic organizations must start taking tangible steps to anticipate this and be present in student circles with language that is easy for them to understand,  the report added. A presidential spokesman declined to comment on the findings.     Hardline Islamic groups late last year led mass street rallies against Jakarta s former governor, a Christian, whom they believed had insulted Islam. They eventually succeeded in derailing Basuki Tjahaja Purnama s re-election bid in April this year, and he was subsequently jailed for blasphemy. The ruling was criticized globally as unjust.  Groups like the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) call for sharia law to be imposed on the country and believe its leaders should only be Muslim. The survey showed that the vast majority of students disagree with the establishment of an Islamic caliphate and violence.      But authorities have repeatedly warned against the creeping influence of radical Islamic thought among student organizations and in campus activities. President Joko Widodo and his government are trying to contain the rising influence of hairline groups, especially in universities and Islamic boarding schools. A presidential decree banning any civil organizations deemed to go against the country s secular state ideology was approved by parliament last month. Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a largely peaceful organization that calls for the establishment of a caliphate in Indonesia, was the first group to be disbanded under the decree.   President Widodo has made several speeches at Islamic boarding schools around the country emphasizing Indonesia s diversity and the importance of national unity. In September, Widodo called at a conference of around 3,000 university rectors  for the promotion of the country s secular ideology,  Pancasila , in education. ",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",1
Mexico women protest violence in skeletal Day of Dead march,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Wearing black clothing and skeletal face paint, dozens of women marched in downtown Mexico City on Wednesday to commemorate the growing number of women murdered and pressure the government to put an end to what they say is the rampant impunity fueling it. About 200 protesters held photos of murdered sisters, daughters and friends while chanting  not one more  in a procession that was a somber contrast to festive events elsewhere in the capital on the eve of Day of the Dead. Homicides of women have risen by nearly a quarter on average under President Enrique Pena Nieto compared with the previous administration, and Mexico s total murder tally is on track to hit the highest level in its modern history this year.  As women we face a lot of danger,  said Claudia Correa, whose 21 year-old daughter, was found dead near her home in Veracruz state last month with stab wounds in the chest and neck, after speaking one evening with her ex-boyfriend. Correa said the ex-boyfriend has since disappeared, and an investigation is underway to find him.  The authorities don t do anything to find these killers and the killers realize that they are taking so long that they have a chance to get away. And they are going to continue doing so if we allow them to,  said Correa, donning a photo of her deceased daughter with the caption  Justice .  The march, planned by about 50 activists, was scheduled to be mirrored on Wednesday evening in several states that have registered high levels of violence against women.  Each case is a tale of horror,  said organizer Ana Elena Contreras, who is pushing the government to do more to end the murder, rape and abuse of women, in a country where thousands of violent crimes go unpunished every year. Contreras said as long as perpetrators are not brought to book, women will continue to face grave risks in Mexico, which scored worse than the most violent countries of Central America in the 2017 Global Impunity Index, published in August. That included Honduras and El Salvador, which have been two of the most murderous countries in the world in the past decade. The problem of violence against women has become so serious in Mexico that the federal penal code now defines certain types of murders as  femicide . Still, measuring the phenomenon of femicides is difficult due to a lack of specific data, said Francisco Rivas, director general of the National Citizen Observatory (ONC), a civil group monitoring justice and security in Mexico.   There s a part of society that still doesn t consider this issue as something serious; they minimize it,  said Rivas. In the first four years of Pena Nieto s government, Mexico registered some 2,543 homicides of women on average, up from  2,051 in the term of his predecessor Felipe Calderon, according to data published by Mexico s national statistics agency. The 2,735 homicides of women last year was the second-highest figure of any year since 1990, and more than double the number recorded a decade ago. ",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",1
White House slams Russia over veto on Syria chemical weapons probe,"(Reuters) - The White House admonished Russia on Wednesday after it vetoed a United Nations plan to continue an ongoing investigation that recently found Syria killed dozens of people with chemical weapons and implored the international body to renew the probe.   Russia cast a veto at the United Nations Security Council eight days ago, preventing the renewal of a mandate for a mission by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) - that investigates the use of chemical weapons in Syria.  Russia s attempts to undermine and eliminate the JIM show a callous disregard for the suffering and loss of life caused by the use of chemical weapons and an utter lack of respect for international norms,  the White House said in a statement.  The JIM found that the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad is to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people last April, according to a report sent to the United Nations Security Council last Thursday.  This unconscionable attack marks the fourth time that the JIM has confirmed that the Assad regime used chemical weapons, underscoring the brutal and horrifying barbarism of Bashar al-Assad and making the protection provided by Russia even more egregious,  the White House said.  JIM was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November.  The United States implores the UN Security Council to renew the mandate of the JIM so that we may continue to identify the perpetrators of these horrific attacks and send a clear message that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated,  the White House said.  In their 14th report since 2011, U.N. investigators said they had in all documented 33 chemical weapons attacks to date. Twenty-seven were by the government of President Bashar al-Assad, including seven between March 1 to July 7. Perpetrators had not been identified yet in six attacks, they said. The Assad government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. It said its strikes in Khan Sheikhoun hit a weapons depot belonging to rebel forces, a claim  excluded  by U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria chairman Paulo Pinheiro. That attack led U.S. President Donald Trump to launch the first U.S. air strikes on a Syrian air base. ",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",1

A security official said a sticky bomb destroyed two tankers, setting off an explosion that engulfed the bus, burning many passengers to death.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which came a day after up to eight people were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Hardline preacher finds refuge in Malaysia as politicized Islam grows,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - When Zakir Naik emerged from a prominent Malaysian mosque last month fans swarmed about him, seeking selfies with the Indian Muslim televangelist whose hardline views have sparked a criminal investigation back in his home country. Accompanied by a bodyguard, Naik was making a rare public appearance at the Putra Mosque in Malaysia s administrative capital, where the prime minister and his cabinet members often worship. Naik, who has been banned in the UK, has been given permanent residency in Malaysia, and embraced by top government officials.  Critics see Naik s presence in Malaysia as another sign of  top-level support for hardline Islam in a country with substantial minorities of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists, and which has long projected a moderate Islamic image.  Support for a more politicized Islam has grown in recent years under Prime Minister Najib Razak, especially after he lost the popular vote in the 2013 general election - the ruling coalition s worst-ever electoral performance.  Since then, his ruling party has been trying to appease an increasingly conservative ethnic Malay-Muslim base and religion has become a battleground ahead of elections the prime minister has to call by mid-2018. Naik, a 52-year-old medical doctor, has aroused controversy with his puritan brand of Islam - recommending the death penalty for homosexuals and those who abandon Islam as their faith, according to media reports. A Youtube video shows Naik saying that if Osama bin Laden  is terrorizing America the terrorist, the biggest terrorist, I am with him . Last week, India s counter-terrorism agency prepared charges against Naik, saying he has been  promoting enmity and hatred between different religious groups in India through public speeches and lectures.  Bangladesh suspended Peace TV channel, which features Naik s preachings, after some media reports claimed bombers of a Dhaka cafe that killed 22 people last year were admirers of him. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.  The Malaysian government accommodates Naik because  he remains a reasonably popular character amongst Malays, who gloss over his more controversial aspects,  said Rashaad Ali, an analyst with S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore.   If the government were to kick him out of the country, it causes them to lose religious credibility in the eyes of the public.  At his appearance at the Putra mosque last month, a female Reuters reporter asked about the investigation in India. Naik would only say:  Sorry, it is not right for me to speak with ladies in public.   Naik did not respond to subsequent requests for comment from Reuters. Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told parliament on Tuesday that Naik, who obtained permanent residency five years ago, was not being given  preferential treatment .  Over the time spent in this country, he has not broken any laws or regulations. As such, there is no reason from a legal standpoint to detain or arrest him,  Zahid said. The government has not received any official request from India  related to terrorism allegations involving him , he added. Zahid and the prime minister have both posted photos on Facebook of their meetings with Naik last year in Malaysia. A group of Malaysian activists has filed suit in the High Court to deport Naik, saying he is a threat to public peace in the multi-racial society - about 40 percent of Malaysia s population is non-Muslim. The group said it was unaware Naik had been going to the Putrajaya mosque - or where he might be in Malaysia. Officials at the Putra Mosque said Naik has been attending Friday prayers there for about a month. He has also been spotted in other mosques, hospitals and restaurants in the administrative capital in recent months, according to witnesses that Reuters spoke to. Naik has in the past denied India s allegations. In an interview with a Kuwaiti television channel in May, he said he was being targeted by the Hindu nationalist government of  Narendra Modi because of his popularity. Malaysia s opposition Islamic Party (PAS), which has defended Naik in the past, last week urged the government to disregard any potential Indian extradition request, saying the allegations aim  to block his influence and efforts to spread religious awareness among the international community.   Islamic groups have stoked controversy for trying to impose their ethos in a multi-cultural country. Malaysian authorities canceled a planned beer festival last month, citing security concerns, and for some years now international pop stars who wish to make appearances in Malaysia face restrictions over clothing and dancing. Islam is the official religion in Malaysia. The laws, however, are secular, though the country does have sharia courts for civil cases for Muslims. Malaysia s nine sultans, who take turns as the mostly ceremonial monarch and are the official guardians of Islam in Malaysia, last month called for unity and religious harmony after what they described as  excessive actions  in the name of Islam. One of them harshly condemned a Muslim-only launderette.  We are seeing this gravitation toward fundamentalism and a conservative idea of Islam because the current government doesn t want to be seen as secular anymore,  said Ahmad Farouk Musa, founder of a moderate Islam think-tank, Islamic Renaissance Front (IRF).  To ensure Malay support, the government thinks it has  to have Islamic credentials just like PAS,  Farouk told Reuters. said.  Islam sells.  In September, Turkish writer Mustafa Akyol was detained for giving  an unauthorized speech  in the Malaysian capital, in which he argued that governments shouldn t police religion or morality. Zahid, also the home minister, said Akyol s book  Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty  has been banned as it  contravened norms of the society in Malaysia . Farouk, who organized the speech, said he now faces charges for abetting Akyol. ",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",1
Hong Kong seeks law banning booing of China's national anthem,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong will try to enact a law penalizing people who boo the Chinese national anthem  as soon as possible , an official said on Wednesday, in a move that critics say undermines the Chinese-ruled city s autonomy and freedoms. In the past few years, some Hong Kong football fans have booed the national anthem during World Cup qualifiers and other games, mirroring a more recent protest in the United States with football players kneeling during the national anthem, a practice  denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Asian Football Confederation warned the Hong Kong Football Association on Tuesday over the conduct of fans who booed the Chinese national anthem in a match in October. China has passed a law stating that disrespecting the anthem could result in imprisonment. The law has come into force in China but has yet to be extended to Hong Kong.  Hong Kong Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Patrick Nip said the city had a constitutional obligation to follow up the move by China s largely rubber-stamp parliament. The law will now be added to the annex of Hong Kong s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, and put to the city s 70-strong legislature.  We will do it as soon as possible,  Nip told lawmakers, while saying there would be a consultation process. Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a so-called  one country, two systems  formula that promises the city a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary. China s growing reach into Hong Kong s affairs has, however, stoked tensions and mass protests including the 2014  Occupy  civil disobedience movement that blocked major roads in the city for 79 days to pressure China to allow full democracy. Nip said no decision had been made on jail terms, but the government would make reference to existing laws concerning the desecration of China s national flag that carry a maximum sentence of three years. Some critics said this move would further erode Hong Kong s autonomy and was another instance of China s tightening iron grip.   If a country (China) wasn t using totalitarian and autocratic ways to make people feel under pressure, I believe many more Hong Kong people would respect the national anthem,  said Dennis Kwok, a lawmaker with the Civic Party. Over the past few years, Hong Kong fans have booed the national anthem at several football matches involving the Hong Kong team, with an upcoming Asian Cup qualifier between Hong Kong and Lebanon another potential flashpoint.   Some inappropriate behavior...must be addressed,  Nip said, without giving specifics. Chinese authorities have strived to instill greater patriotism into Hong Kong, while condemning a push from democracy activists to distance Hong Kong from Beijing by embracing the city s culture and core values, with some even advocating independence from China.   In recent years, incidents of disrespecting the national anthem have occurred in Hong Kong, challenging the bottom line ... and triggering rage,  said Zhang Rongshun, who leads a legislative affairs commission of China s parliament, the National People s Congress, according to the official Xinhua news agency.  It is urgent and important to apply the National Anthem Law in Hong Kong in a bid to prevent and handle such offences.  ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
"In meeting, Trump to push a reluctant Xi to rein in North Korea","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will further pressure Chinese President Xi Jinping in talks next week to take tougher measures against North Korea, as the United States compiles information for possible new sanctions on Chinese banks working with Pyongyang. Senior administration officials say Trump will try to convince Xi when they meet in Beijing to squeeze North Korea with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. It is the latest attempt by Trump to have China, North Korea s only major ally, rein in Pyongyang s nuclear weapons ambitions but it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree. China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is trying to curtail the isolated nation s nuclear and missile tests.     North Korea this year conducted a powerful nuclear test detonation and has test-fired intercontinental ballistic missiles that, if perfected, could reach the U.S. mainland. Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea gaining that capability. Two U.S. officials said the threat of additional U.N. and other economic sanctions on North Korea is another option to solicit greater cooperation from China, by playing on Beijing s concerns that deeper poverty in North Korea could prompt an exodus of refugees across its border. The officials said the United States and its allies have been collecting detailed information on Chinese bank transactions with North Korea to try to identify institutions with the  most egregious  records of doing business with Pyongyang. The objective, the officials said, is to craft a proposal for escalating sanctions on Chinese financial and other entities that stops short of sanctioning the People s Bank of China central bank. Washington so far has mostly held off on new sanctions against Chinese banks and companies doing business with North Korea, given fears of retaliation by Beijing and possibly far-reaching effects on the world economy. In a brief statement on Thursday formally announcing the visit from the Chinese end, the country s foreign ministry said China was ready to work with the United States to achieve  important results  for Trump s visit. It did not elaborate.   Trump s stop in Beijing is part of a Nov. 3-14 tour of five Asian nations in which North Korea will be a major focus. The visit includes U.S. allies Japan and South Korea who have watched with increasing worry as the United States and North Korea have exchanged bellicose rhetoric.     To prepare for his trip, Trump met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a key player in President Richard Nixon s opening to China in 1972.  And over lunch last week at the White House, Trump asked Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for his opinion about North Korea and its unpredictable leader, a participant said. Lee told him that Kim sees his nuclear weapons program as essential to his survival after the U.S.-led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddhafi s downfall.  Lee said it s probably impossible for Kim to become convinced that the United States doesn t want to overthrow him,  a participant at the lunch said.  They re super-paranoid.                      While part of the U.S. strategy on North Korea is to deprive Kim Jong Un s government of resources, Trump has left open the threat of military force. U.S. officials, while emphasizing they want a diplomatic solution, have highlighted military preparedness to counter a North Korean threat and there are three U.S. aircraft carrier groups in the region. Trump has threatened to  totally destroy  North Korea and has derided Kim as a  Rocket Man  on a suicide mission, to the dismay of some U.S. military and intelligence officials who fear such rhetoric could backfire.      As well as pressuring China, the United States is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea, using a  New York channel  to get in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang s United Nations mission.  Analysts in Asia are skeptical Trump s pressure on China will work.  I don t think China will seriously change its existing policy on North Korea simply because of more pressure from the United States,  said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.     China s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told reporters on Monday it will take a broad effort to pressure North Korea and China alone cannot solve the problem.  China has been doing everything we can on the Korean issue,  he said. In Japan, the threat from Pyongyang hit close to home after tests this year in which two ballistic missiles flew over its territory. But there is concern in Tokyo that the Trump administration lacks a clear North Korea strategy.  The biggest worry is that Trump s grand Asia policy, North Korea policy, is not well defined... but responds to circumstances instead... ,  said Toshihiro Nayakama, a professor at Keio University.  They turn to China to exert pressure but the question is to what extent there is Chinese pressure. I believe this is not yet evaluated by the U.S. administration,  he said. The Trump administration has considered threatening China with trade actions over its resistance to do more on North Korea. While some advisers from outside his administration have  urged Trump to pursue this course, he has been persuaded against it by his own advisers who have warned of a trade war, U.S. officials said.

"UK seeks arrest of Manchester bomber's brother, asks Libya to extradite him","LONDON (Reuters) - British police said on Wednesday they had issued an arrest warrant for the brother of a suicide bomber who killed 22 people in an attack on a pop concert in Manchester in May and prosecutors had asked Libya to extradite him. Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton born to Libyan parents, blew himself up at the end of a show by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in the deadliest militant attack in Britain for 12 years. His victims included seven children among the victims while more than 500 were injured. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, who is responsible for counter-terrorism in northwest England, said police had now applied for and been granted an arrest warrant for Abedi s younger brother Hashem for murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion.  Hashem Abedi is currently detained in Libya and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) has now requested that Libyan authorities consider his extradition back to the United Kingdom,  Jackson said.  We are grateful for the Libyan authorities considering this request.  He added that detectives had not found any evidence of the involvement of any wider network.  Islamic State said it was responsible in the immediate aftermath of the bombing but security services have always treated the claim with scepticism. Days after the attack Libyan counter-terrorism investigators arrested Hashem Abedi and the brothers  father Ramadan.  In June, the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), a counter-terrorism force aligned with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, said Hashem Abedi had told them that his brother had been radicalised in Britain in 2015. They had both flown from Britain to Libya in April and Hashem said he had helped buy the equipment necessary for the attack although he had not known that Salman was planning a bombing, Rada said.  British police say Salman Abedi returned to Manchester on May 18, four days before his attack. The family had emigrated to Britain during the rule of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, moving from London to the Fallowfield area of south Manchester where they lived for more than a decade. The brothers  parents returned to Libya during the country s 2011 revolution. Jackson said their investigation was still running  at a very fast pace  and the inquiry had involved a trawl through 16,000 hours of closed circuit TV (CCTV) footage and more than 8 million lines of telephone communications data. Police have previously said they believed Salman Abedi had built the bomb himself and CCTV showed him buying nuts from a hardware store that were used as shrapnel as well as the tin that was believed to contain the explosives.

Israeli air strike hits near Syria's Homs,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - An Israeli air strike targeted a factory south of the Syrian city of Homs on Wednesday and the Syrian army responded by firing a surface-to-air missile at the aircraft, a commander in a military alliance fighting in support of Damascus said.   The commander told Reuters the air strike had hit a copper factory in the industrial town of Hisya, 35 km (21 miles) south of Homs and 112 km (70 miles) north of Damascus. The commander did not give details of any casualties. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organization that reports on the war, said the air strike had targeted a military installation.     An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment. Israel s Channel 10 said the aircraft were not hit and returned safely to base. The Israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and its Lebanese ally, the Iran-backed Hezbollah, nearly 100 times in recent years. Israeli officials have expressed alarm at Iranian influence in Syria, where Iran-backed groups have played a critical role fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad during the conflict that erupted in 2011. Iran s military chief General Mohammad Baqeri warned Israel against breaching Syrian airspace and territory during a visit to Damascus last month. Last month, five projectiles from Syria set off air raid sirens in Israeli towns, prompting the Israeli military to say it would step up its response to stray fire from the Syrian war that has repeatedly spilled over the border. The Israeli air force attacked a Syrian anti-aircraft battery earlier that week that Israel said had fired a missile at its planes while they were on a reconnaissance mission over neighboring Lebanon. Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, which last fought a major conflict in 2006, have escalated this year. Each side has warned it would unleash devastating firepower in the event of a full-scale war.   ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
"Awaiting Trump's coal comeback, miners reject retraining","WAYNESBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - When Mike Sylvester entered a career training center earlier this year in southwestern Pennsylvania, he found more than one hundred federally funded courses covering everything from computer programming to nursing. He settled instead on something familiar: a coal mining course.   I think there is a coal comeback,  said the 33-year-old son of a miner. Despite broad consensus about coal s bleak future, a years-long effort to diversify the economy of this hard-hit region away from mining is stumbling, with Obama-era jobs retraining classes undersubscribed and future programs at risk under President Donald Trump s proposed 2018 budget. Trump has promised to revive coal by rolling back environmental regulations and moved to repeal Obama-era curbs on carbon emissions from power plants.   I have a lot of faith in President Trump,  Sylvester said. But hundreds of coal-fired plants have closed in recent years, and cheap natural gas continues to erode domestic demand. The Appalachian region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs since 2011, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission.  Although there have been small gains in coal output and hiring this year, driven by foreign demand, production levels remain near lows hit in 1978. A White House official did not respond to requests for comment on coal policy and retraining for coal workers. What many experts call false hopes for a coal resurgence have mired economic development efforts here in a catch-22: Coal miners are resisting retraining without ready jobs from new industries, but new companies are unlikely to move here without a trained workforce. The stalled diversification push leaves some of the nation s poorest areas with no clear path to prosperity. Federal retraining programs have fared better, with some approaching full participation, in the parts of Appalachia where mining has been crushed in a way that leaves little hope for a comeback, according to county officials and recruiters. They include West Virginia and Kentucky, where coal resources have been depleted. But in southern Pennsylvania, where the industry still has ample reserves and is showing flickers of life, federal jobs retraining programs see sign-up rates below 20 percent, the officials and recruiters said. In southern Virginia s coal country, participation rates run about 50 percent, they said.  Part of our problem is we still have coal,  said Robbie Matesic, executive director of Greene County s economic development department.   Out-of-work miners cite many reasons beyond faith in Trump policy for their reluctance to train for new industries, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen former and prospective coal workers, career counselors and local economic development officials. They say mining pays well; other industries are unfamiliar; and there s no income during training and no guarantee of a job afterward.  In Pennsylvania, Corsa Coal opened a mine in Somerset in June which will create about 70 jobs   one of the first mines to open here in years. And Consol Energy recently expanded its Bailey mine complex in Greene County.  But Consol also announced in January that it plans to sell its coal holdings to focus on natural gas. And it has commissioned a recruitment agency, GMS Mines and Repair, to find contract laborers for its coal expansion who will be paid about $13 an hour - half the hourly wage of a starting unionized coal worker. The program Sylvester signed up for was set up by GMS. The new hiring in Pennsylvania is related mainly to an uptick in foreign demand for metallurgical coal, used in producing steel, rather than domestic demand for thermal coal from power plants, the industry s main business. Some market analysts describe the foreign demand as a temporary blip driven by production problems in the coal hub of Australia. Officials for U.S. coal companies operating in the region, including Consol and Corsa, declined requests for comment.   The coal industry has stabilized, but it s not going to come back,  said Blair Zimmerman, a 40-year veteran of the mines who is now the commissioner for Greene County, one of Pennsylvania s oldest coal regions. We need to look at the future.  The Pennsylvania Department of Labor has received about $2 million since 2015 from the federal POWER program, an initiative of former President Barack Obama to help retrain workers in coal-dependent areas. But the state is having trouble putting even that modest amount of money to good use. In Greene and Washington counties, 120 people have signed up for jobs retraining outside the mines, far short of the target of 700, said Ami Gatts, director of the Washington-Greene County Job Training Agency. In Westmoreland and Fayette counties, participation in federal job retraining programs has been about 15 percent of capacity, officials said.  I can t even get them to show up for free food I set up in the office,  said Dave Serock, an ex-miner who recruits in Fayette County for Southwest Training Services. Programs administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, a federal and state partnership to strengthen the region s economy, have had similar struggles. One $1.4 million ARC project to teach laid-off miners in Greene County and in West Virginia computer coding has signed up only 20 people for 95 slots. Not a single worker has enrolled in another program launched this summer to prepare ex-miners to work in the natural gas sector, officials said. Greene County Commissioner Zimmerman said he d like to see a big company like Amazon or Toyota come to southwestern Pennsylvania to build a distribution or manufacturing plant that could employ thousands.  But he knows first the region needs a ready workforce. Amazon spokeswoman Ashley Robinson said the company the company typically works with local organizations to evaluate whether locations have an appropriate workforce and has no current plans for distribution operations in Western Pennsylvania. Toyota spokesman Edward Lewis said the company considers local workforce training an  important consideration  when deciding where to locate facilities.  Sean Moodie and his brother Steve spent the last two years working in the natural gas industry, but see coal as a good bet in the current political climate.    I am optimistic that you can make a good career out of coal for the next 50 years,  said Sean Moodie. Coal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel. Like Sylvester, the Moodie brothers are taking mining courses offered by Consol s recruiter, GMS. Bob Levo, who runs a GMS training program, offered a measure of realism: The point of the training is to provide low-cost and potentially short-term labor to a struggling industry, he said.   That s a major part of the reason that coal mines have been able to survive,  he said.  They rely on us to provide labor at lower cost.  Clemmy Allen, 63, a veteran miner and head of the United Mineworkers of America s Career Centers, said miners are taking a big risk in holding out for a coal recovery. He s placing his hopes for the region s future on retraining. UMWA s 64-acre campus in Prosperity, Pennsylvania - which once trained coal miners - will use nearly $3 million in federal and state grants to retrofit classrooms to teach cybersecurity, truck driving and mechanical engineering.  Unlike when I worked in the mines,  he said,  if you get laid off now, you are pretty much laid off.

U.S. judge frees Indonesian immigrant held by Trump order,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the release of an illegal immigrant who is among 47 Indonesians in New Hampshire challenging the Trump administration s order to deport them. The man, Terry Rombot, had been allowed to remain under the terms of a 2010 deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until this year, when President Donald Trump instructed ICE that all people living in the United States illegally were subject to deportation. Rombot, part of a wave of Indonesian Christians who fled their country following deadly riots in 1998, learned of the policy change when he appeared for an Aug. 1 check-in with ICE and was arrested.  He walks out of the courthouse right now,  Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris said after concluding that Rombot s detention violated his rights. He walked out of the U.S. District Court in Boston in his blue jail scrubs, without a chance to change into street clothes. Rombot s lawyers said he was arrested despite a 2015 letter from ICE saying he would have a chance to prepare for an  orderly  departure.  The judge cited that letter during Wednesday s hearing in holding that Rombot s detention despite ICE s previous guidance violated his due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.  This is what intent was, that he would be given the opportunity to leave under his own steam and not under shackles,  she said. Outside the courtroom, Rombot said:  I just want to say thank you to my attorney, my pastor and all of my friends.  The U.S. Attorney s office is considering an appeal, a spokeswoman said.  ICE officials said the arrangement had always been a temporary one and that the agency always had discretion to deport the people covered by the arrangement.  The Indonesians are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around the city of Dover in New Hampshire s seacoast region.  Members of the group and advocates say they fear they could face discrimination or violence if forced to return to the world s largest Muslim-majority country. Their cause has drawn the support of Republican Governor Chris Sununu and New Hampshire s all-Democratic congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen. Saris previously ordered a stay to the deportations. She is currently weighing whether she can order a longer delay to give the affected people time to renew their efforts to gain legal status.

Canada to propose helicopters for U.N. Mali mission: sources,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada, under pressure from allies to boost its commitment to peacekeeping, will propose offering helicopters for use by U.N. forces in Mali and could later provide troops to work as trainers, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s Liberal government, which came to power in 2015 and quickly promised to make 600 soldiers available for peace operations, last year said it would consider sending soldiers to Mali but has repeatedly put off a decision amid fears of casualties. The stalling has irritated other nations, which say it could harm Canada s efforts to win a seat on the Security Council. Canada is prepared to send six helicopters for use by the 10,000-strong U.N. force in Mali, which is helping deal with a militant threat, said the sources, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. More than 80 members have been killed since 2013, making Mali the world s deadliest peacekeeping operation. Canada is hosting an international peacekeeping conference later this month and officials are preparing a special meeting on the sidelines to discuss the needs of the Mali mission, both in terms of providing troops and helping train local forces, the sources said. One option for Canada would be to send soldiers to act as trainers, a role they are already playing in northern Iraq, said one source. They could either be based in Mali or nearby nations. Although Ottawa has sent three separate fact-finding missions to the Mali region, Canadian officials said they have yet to take a final decision on whether to send troops.  We realize there is growing impatience for a final decision,  said a Canadian source familiar with government thinking. Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan told reporters that  when it comes to peace support operations... we will make sure that we take our time to make a responsible decision.  He declined to give further details. Defense experts said that given the scale of the Mali challenge, they doubted whether even 600 Canadian troops could make a difference on the front lines.  A senior diplomat from a nation involved in peacekeeping said the Canadian government should have studied the Mali mission carefully before publicly discussing the possibility of sending troops.  If soldiers start coming home in coffins, it s debatable whether Sajjan could give a coherent explanation of why Canada was there in the first place,  said the diplomat.

Ukrainian minister's son gets conditional release in graft case,"KIEV (Reuters) - A Ukrainian judge released the son of Ukraine s interior ministry from custody on Wednesday on the condition he appear in court as required in connection with an embezzlement case. On Tuesday, Ukraine s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) detained three people in connection with the suspected embezzlement of $521,000 through a contract to supply backpacks to the interior ministry. Ukrainian media reported former deputy interior minister Serhiy Chebotar and Interior Minister Arsen Avakov s son, Oleksandr, were among those taken into custody. According to news agency Interfax Ukraine, a Kiev district court ruled Oleksandr Avakov could be released provided  he appear as demanded by investigators and report on his movements.  The so-called  backpacks case  has been openly discussed in Ukraine since 2015, and the detentions were welcomed by anti-corruption activists as a sign that NABU is fulfilling its mandate to investigate high-profile graft cases linked to officials. Nevertheless, the detention of a senior cabinet minister s family member has also been interpreted as a sign of a possible power struggle within the political elite. In a statement, the interior ministry said the case was politically motivated, while Avakov said his son would fight all allegations in court.   Neither my son nor the firms he has founded have or had a single kopeck (cent) from the Ukrainian budget,  he said on Facebook. The individuals are suspected of allowing the interior ministry to be overcharged for a contract to purchase backpacks in 2015, according to the NABU investigation.  The goods were not delivered on time and did not meet the requirements set by the Ukrainian interior ministry, as a result of which the state was hit with a loss of over 14 million hryvnias ($521,000),  NABU said. NABU was established as part of Ukraine s Western-backed reform drive under which Kiev promised to root out graft and modernize the economy in exchange for billions of dollars in international funding. But Ukraine s backers have seen a failure to bring corrupt lawmakers and senior officials to justice as an indication the authorities may lack the commitment to eliminate the power of vested interests.

Ousted Catalan leader says will not return to Spain to testify,"MADRID (Reuters) - Dismissed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont said on Wednesday he would ignore a court order to return to Spain to answer charges over the region s push for independence, but he could testify from Belgium. If Puigdemont fails to answer Thursday s High Court summons, an arrest warrant could be issued that would make it virtually impossible for him to stand in a snap regional election called by the Spanish government for Dec. 21. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Puigdemont and his government on Friday, hours after the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by the opposition and declared illegal by Spanish courts. On Monday, Spain s state prosecutor filed charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against Puigdemont for defying the central government by holding an referendum on secession on Oct. 1 and proclaiming independence. Puigdemont traveled to Belgium at the weekend with other members of the dismissed Catalan administration and hired a lawyer.  Those summonses are part of proceedings that lack any legal basis and only seek to punish ideas. This is a political trial,  Puigdemont said in a statement signed by  the legitimate government of Catalonia .  The High Court summoned Puigdemont and 13 other former members of the Catalan government to testify in Madrid on Thursday and Friday on the prosecutor s charges. A judge will then decide whether those called to testify should go to jail pending an investigation that could take several years and potentially lead to a trial. The judge might also grant them conditional bail or order them to surrender their passports. If Puigdemont and his associates did not turn up, the judge would be more likely to order them jailed as a flight risk.  The courts have also told the Catalan secessionist leaders to deposit 6.2 million euros ($7.2 million) by Friday to cover potential liabilities. Three former Catalan government advisors returned to Spain from Belgium late on Tuesday and were greeted at Barcelona s international airport by a small crowd chanting  off to prison . Puigdemont said on Tuesday he would only go back to Spain when given unspecified  guarantees  by the Spanish government. He said he accepted the election called by Rajoy for December and Madrid said he was welcome to stand, though the legal proceedings might prevent that. Uncertainty over how the crisis will play out has prompted more than 1,800 Catalonia-based companies to move their legal headquarters out of the region and the government to lower its national economic forecasts for next year. On Wednesday, rating agency Moody s said the declaration of independence and the suspension of self rule were credit negative for the region and the country, and that associated uncertainty would damage sentiment and consumer spending. Moody s raised Spain s credit rating to Baa2 in 2014 as the country emerged from a prolonged economic slump. On Tuesday, Moody s affirmed Catalonia s long-term issuer and debt ratings of Ba3, saying the government s reinforced control compensated for the increased risks, in particular the region s rapidly deteriorating business climate.

Seven bodies found in migrant boat off Libya,"ROME (Reuters) - The bodies of seven migrants were discovered on Wednesday in a boat adrift off Libya while around 900 people were saved in operations in the southern Mediterranean, Italy s coastguard said. It was one of the most intense days of rescues recorded in the area in recent months and follows a sharp fall-off in the number of migrants reaching Italy. A Coastguard spokesman said the seven bodies were picked up by a boat under the command of a European Union naval force operating in the Mediterranean. He had no further information about who they were or how they had died. About 900 migrants were rescued in eight different missions, the spokesman said, adding that he expected they would be brought to Italy later in the week. Migrant arrivals in Italy fell 30 percent in the first eight months of the year, the Interior Ministry said this week, thanks mainly to a sharp decline since July when Italy struck a deal with Libya to block would-be asylum seekers from setting sail. As part of the deal, the Libyan coastguard has played a much more active role in preventing crossings. Earlier this week, it intercepted 299 migrants from sub-Saharan African countries on two rubber boats east of Tripoli, officials said. Libya s western shoreline is the main departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by boat, many of them fleeing conflict or poverty.  The Interior Ministry said on Tuesday that between January and October, 111,397 migrants had reached Italy by boat against 159,427 in the same period in 2016. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says that so far this year at least 2,630 people have died at sea trying to cross to Italy. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
UK parliament says government must publish secret Brexit impact studies,"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers ramped up pressure on the government to publish its assessment of the impact Brexit will have on the economy, passing a motion in parliament on Wednesday which could compel the government to release the papers. The government said on Monday it had carried out 58 economic assessments, covering sectors from aerospace to tourism, but has so far refused requests from lawmakers to publish them, saying they could undermine their negotiating position in Brexit talks. That has irked lawmakers - including some from Prime Minister Theresa May s own party - who say the documents should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and used to help shape the public debate around what a good EU exit deal would look like. Parliament agreed a motion stating that the documents should be released to a parliamentary committee. The government did not oppose the motion but it was unclear if its passage would force them to act.  The debate ended in confusion with the Speaker of the House indicating that he believed the government was obliged to comply with the motion, but saying he would wait to see what their response was before acting further.  We take all parliamentary votes seriously and recognize that parliament does have rights relating to the publication of documents,  a Brexit department spokeswoman said.   Ministers also have a clear obligation not to disclose information when doing so would not be in the public interest. We will reflect on the implications of the vote and respond in due course.  Labour said the result was clear and called on Brexit minister David Davis to set a date for the papers  publication.  Labour has been absolutely clear since the referendum that ministers could not withhold vital information from Parliament about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy,  said Labour s Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer. Binding or not, a rancorous debate underlined the extent to which May s approach to Brexit is generating dissent in parliament and potentially undermining her ability to rely on its support when passing crucial laws to implement the EU exit.   I m not going to stand by and see the future of my children s generation and the grandchildren which I hope will follow being trashed or ruined without any form of debate and disclosure as to the consequences,  said Anna Soubry, one of several Conservative lawmakers who said they were ready to rebel. The central plank of May s Brexit strategy, a piece of legislation known as the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, will require all May s lawmakers to back her if the minority Conservative government is to avoid making concessions.  A debate on the bill is due to begin on Nov 14. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
Liberia's Supreme Court halts election preparation over fraud accusations,"MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia s Supreme Court has halted preparations for next week s presidential run-off vote between former soccer star George Weah and Vice President Joseph Boakai until it considers a challenge to first round results by a losing candidate who alleged fraud.     The decision casts further doubt on the Oct. 10 poll that losing parties say was marred by foul play at polling stations and at the highest levels of government.  It could also delay a second-round vote scheduled for Nov. 7 to find a successor to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 and is the country s first elected leader since a 14-year civil war ended in 2003. In a writ issued late on Tuesday, the court instructed the Liberty Party of third-placed Charles Brumskine, who made the complaint, and the National Elections Commission, to file briefs by Thursday.   This is a big step in the right direction,  said Liberty Party Chairman Benjamin Sanvee.  The Court recognizes the gravity of the issues and has taken action in defense of the law and democracy.   This week, Boakai s ruling Unity Party announced it was backing the legal challenge. It accused Johnson Sirleaf, one of its own members, of interfering in the October vote by holding private meetings with election magistrates. Johnson Sirleaf denied the meetings were inappropriate. Observers from the European Union and the Carter Center say they saw no major problems with the first round vote. The Supreme Court s decision is an example of an increasingly assertive role some African judiciaries are playing in overseeing elections. Kenya s Supreme Court annulled the results of a presidential election in August. National Elections Commission chairman Jerome Korkoya questioned the need for the Supreme Court s decision, which he said has halted preparations for the vote, including training polling station staff.   Let me categorically say I see no reason, legal or otherwise, for such an order,  he told reporters.  The election was transparent and credible.   Looking to head off a crisis, the chairman of West African regional body ECOWAS, Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe, and the African Union chair, Guinea s president Alpha Conde, arrived in the capital Monrovia on Wednesday.  There have been some complaints, some challenges. That process is ongoing in keeping with the rule of law,  Johnson Sirleaf said at a news conference alongside Gnassingbe, Conde, Weah, Boakai and three other candidates.   This democratic process must be concluded within the time frame of the constitution so that I may be able to retire and end this transition successfully,  she said.     The streets of Monrovia remained calm though the court ruling raised tension in the capital where memories of the war are fresh. Large numbers of riot police deployed outside the Supreme Court and election commission headquarters.  I see this entire process as critical to our survival as a nation. We must do all to avoid sliding into war,  said student David Farmah.  No one has money to have a re-run of the election. It should go ahead.  Weah won the first round with 38.4 percent of the vote to Boakai s 28.8 percent. He has tapped into frustration with Johnson Sirleaf s 12-year tenure, which has seen a post-war peace consolidated and the economy quadruple in size but has failed to root out corruption and alleviate poverty.  Morluba Morlu, a senior official from Weah s CDC party, said on Wednesday he still expected the run-off to go ahead next week.  It is sad for a ruling party that has been in power for 12 years (to) be crying,  he said of Unity Party s support for the legal challenge.  We don t want any mockery of this election.

Hamas cedes Gaza border crossings to Palestinian Authority control,"GAZA (Reuters) - The Islamist group Hamas began ceding control of the Gaza Strip s border crossings with Israel and Egypt to U.S.-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday under an agreement brokered by Cairo to end a decade of internal schism. The move marked the most concrete implementation of the Oct. 11 reconciliation deal that Palestinians hope will ease economic restrictions on Gaza and enable more fruitful negotiations on their goal of setting up an independent state. Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah said in a statement that taking charge of the crossings would help Abbas s Palestinian Authority (PA) fulfill its duty  to improve the living conditions of our people . Israel and the United States have reservations about the intra-Palestinian pact, however, given refusals by Hamas - which has fought three wars with Israel since seizing control of Gaza in 2007 from forces loyal to Abbas - to relinquish its rockets and other arms. Witnesses said PA employees moved into Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings on the Israeli border and Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border, as Hamas counterparts packed up equipment and departed on trucks.  We have handed over the crossings with honesty and responsibility, without bargaining and unconditionally,  Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a video address. Citing security concerns, Israel maintains tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods at its crossings with the Gaza Strip, including an almost blanket ban on exports from the territory. COGAT, the Israeli military-run authority that supervises Erez and Kerem Shalom, said a meeting would be held with a PA representative to define joint working protocols and Israeli security conditions, including  the complete absence of any Hamas member or representative  at or near the crossings. Egypt, which in the past has accused Hamas of aiding an Islamist insurgency in its Sinai peninsula bordering Gaza, has kept Rafah largely closed. Hamas denies the allegations and has stepped up security along the frontier. Nickolay Mladenov, U.N. special Coordinator for the Middle East peace process, said transfer of the crossings was a  landmark development  in the reconciliation process, and he called in a statement for  the positive momentum to be maintained . PA ministers have begun gradually to assume their duties in Gaza in past weeks and on Tuesday took over the revenue accounts of the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings, officials said.  Hamas had used those revenues - taxes and fees collected from merchants and passengers - as part of its Gaza budget, to pay salaries of the 40,000 to 50,000 employees it has hired since 2007. Those wages will now be paid by the PA, under the Cairo agreement. Hamas also maintains an armed wing, which analysts say has at least 25,000 well-equipped fighters. It remains the dominant force in Gaza, an enclave of two million people. The Palestinian Authority will begin operating the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings immediately, officials said, while in Rafah the operation will await further security arrangements such as deploying a force from Abbas s presidential guards and Cairo completing innovations on its side of the facility.

North Korean defector pushes diplomatic solution in U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A rare high-level defector from North Korea told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that disseminating more information in the reclusive country would ultimately be more effective than the billions of dollars being spent to address the military threat.  We can educate (the) North Korean population to stand up by disseminating outside information,  Thae Yong-ho, chief of mission at Pyongyang s embassy in Britain until he defected in 2016, said during an appearance at Congress two days before President Donald Trump s first trip to Asia since taking office. Asked what kind of information he was discussing, Thae said background about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, like his birth date, to convey the idea that he and his family  are not gods.  He said South Korean videos, for example were increasingly available within the North.   The U.S. is spending billions of dollars to cope with the military threat and yet how much does the U.S. spend each year on information activities involving North Korea in a year? Unfortunately, it may be a tiny fraction,  he said. Thae made his first visit to Washington during rising international tensions over North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missiles program. The crisis is expected to dominate Trump s trip to the region, which includes a stop in South Korea. Thae also told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that U.S. officials should meet with Kim at least once to try to understand his thinking and convince him that he is risking mass destruction. Thae said Kim thinks he can force the United States to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and drive U.S. forces off the Korean peninsula. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Washington was quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea, despite Trump s public assertion that such talks are a waste of time. Amid a war of words between Kim, who has called Trump a  mentally deranged dotard,  and Trump, who referred to Kim as  little rocket man,  many U.S. lawmakers have been pushing for non-military solutions to the crisis. Representative Ed Royce, the committee s Republican chairman, called at the hearing for a  dramatic increase  in the number of individuals and entities targeted for sanctions, without delay. Thae is the highest-level defector from North Korea in two decades. In emotional testimony, he described a life before he left for South Korea that mixed relative privilege and oppression. He said he defected because he could not let his sons lead  a life, like me, as a modern-day slave.  ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
"Khamenei says Iran, Russia should cooperate to isolate U.S., foster Middle East stability","TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that Tehran and Moscow must step up cooperation to isolate the United States and help stabilize the Middle East, state TV reported. Iran and Russia are the main allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while the United States, Turkey and most Arab states support rebel groups fighting to overthrow him. Putin met Iranian political leaders in an effort to nurture a warming relationship strengthened since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened recently to abandon the international nuclear deal with Iran reached in 2015.  Our cooperation can isolate America ... The failure of U.S.-backed terrorists in Syria cannot be denied but Americans continue their plots,  Khamenei told Putin, according to Iranian state television. Since Russia s military intervention in Syria s war in 2015, and with stepped-up Iranian military assistance, Assad has taken back large amounts of territory from rebels as well as swathes of central and eastern Syria from Islamic State militants. Moscow is now trying to build on that success with a new diplomatic initiative, including a congress of Syria s rival parties it plans in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Nov. 18, though a major opposition bloc has refused to take part. Pragmatist Iranian President Hassan Rouhani echoed Khamenei, saying Iran and Russia together could tackle  regional terrorism  - an allusion to Sunni Muslim armed groups hostile to Iran, Assad and many other Arab states.  Our cooperation has helped the fight against terrorism in the region ... Together we can establish regional peace and security,  Rouhani said in a televised joint press conference with Putin and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, who took part in a three-way summit in Tehran. The rapprochement between Iran and Russia is worrying for both Saudi Arabia, Shi ite Muslim Tehran s main Sunni rival for dominance in the Middle East, and the United States. Putin praised cooperation with Iran as  very productive .   We are managing to coordinate our positions on the Syrian issue,  Putin said. Moscow is also an important ally for Iran in its renewed confrontation with the United States, where Trump broke ranks with major allies on Oct. 13 by de-certifying Tehran s nuclear deal with six world powers including Washington under his predecessor Barack Obama.  Trump has called the agreement  the worst deal ever negotiated  and branded Iran a  terrorist nation  for involvement in conflicts in the Middle East.  We oppose any unilateral change in the multilateral nuclear deal,  Putin told Khamenei, Iranian state TV reported.  Russia has criticized Trump s disavowal of the nuclear agreement, which has opened a 60-day window for the U.S. Congress to act to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran. These were lifted under the 2015 accord in return for Tehran curbing nuclear activity of potential use in developing an atomic bomb.  This is a very important visit (by Putin) ... It shows the determination of Tehran and Moscow to deepen their strategic alliance ..., which will shape the future of the Middle East,  an Iranian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  Both Russia and Iran are under American pressure ... Tehran has no other choice but to rely on Moscow to ease the U.S. pressure,  said the official. Another Iranian official said Trump s hawkish Iran policy had united the Islamic Republic s often feuding leadership - split into hardline conservative, pragmatist and reformist factions - in alignment with Russia.  During Putin s visit, Russian oil producer Rosneft and the National Iranian Oil Company agreed an outline deal to work on a number of  strategic  projects in Iran together worth up to $30 billion. The deal appeared to dovetail with Putin s strategy to reassert Russian political and economic influence in the Middle East that faded after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

Colombia's FARC leader Timochenko to run for presidency in 2018,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Veteran FARC leader Rodrigo Londono - known as  Timochenko  - will run for the presidency of Colombia next year, with the backing of former FARC rebels, the group s new political party said on Wednesday. However, he and other ex-commanders will likely face trials for human rights crimes and it is unclear how they would serve in office if sentenced.  The Marxist FARC demobilized under a peace deal with the government last year, ending more than five decades of war. They are now the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force party, still referring to themselves by the Spanish initials FARC. The party is guaranteed 10 seats in Congress through 2026 by the accord, regardless of its success in elections. Among senate candidates will be former guerrilla commanders Ivan Marquez, Pablo Catatumbo, Carlos Antonio Lozada and Victoria Sandino, the FARC said on Wednesday. The party will also run candidates for the lower house in five districts. The group reiterated its willingness to forming a coalition with other leftist parties, a tacit acknowledgement it may have little electoral pull among skeptical Colombians.  We manifest our willingness to hold talks with all social political groups and movements to make united lists,  the FARC said in a statement. Londono, best known by his war alias Timochenko, suffered a stroke this year and has received treatment in Cuba. It remains unclear how the FARC members would complete their terms if they are tried or sentenced by transitional justice tribunals tasked with bringing former rebels to justice for crimes like murder, kidnapping and rape. The maximum sentence the tribunals can hand out is eight years and those convicted will avoid traditional jails, instead doing reparations work like removing land mines. In a Wednesday press conference, the FARC leaders did not clarify how they would serve possible sentences while holding elected positions. More than 11,000 FARC fighters and supporters handed over their weapons to the United Nations during demobilization.  Another 1,000 refused to lay down their arms and continue to operate lucrative drug trafficking and illegal mining operations. The FARC has sought to distance itself from the dissidents and the government has authorized air raids against them. There is a crowded field for 2018 s presidential race, which looks set to focus more on issues like the economy and corruption than on implementation of the deal, the cornerstone of current President Juan Manuel Santos  legacy. Security does however remain on the minds of many voters, especially after farmers were killed in a confrontation with police last month. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1

Mexicans dismayed by rise of Trump's border wall,"TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump s wall is far from built but towering concrete and steel prototypes in San Diego are making Mexicans living just south of the border feel his campaign pledge has turned them into  pariahs.  Eight samples as high as 30 feet (9 meters) were completed last week near the Otay Mesa border crossing, the first tangible sign of Trump s vow to build a wall from California to Texas for some $21.6 billion.   Opposite San Diego, residents of the Mexican city of Tijuana, where homes, companies and parks abut a corrugated steel fence on the border, dread the prospect of work on a permanent wall.  People are still going to cross out of necessity even though they view us as pariahs over there,  said student Paola Gomez, 21, standing outside her home as the noise of workers putting up the sections drifted across the border.  That s how it looks with things like (the wall): they view us as pariahs. The worst thing is, it s being built by Latinos themselves.  Trump pledged frequently during his presidential campaign to build the wall to help tackle illegal immigration and crime in the United States. He launched his bid in June 2015, accusing Mexicans of sending rapists and drug-runners into the United States, comments that caused widespread outrage south of the border. Tijuana locals said they heard Spanish-speaking workers helping to build the prototypes, driving home the irony that Latino labor was being used to deter immigration from Latin America.  They need Mexicans and other undocumented people. They save lots of money with us,  said Manuela Altamirano, 42, who watched from her home as the strips of wall went up.  Trump constantly does things to humiliate the Mexican people ... These walls are like monsters he created, like a border Frankenstein.  Around 20 protesters gathered on the Mexican side last weekend, setting a Trump-style pinata on fire and waving signs reading  No to the wall  and  We re not enemies , said organizer Sergio Tamay of migrant shelter Angels Without Borders. Even if the plan never moves forward, the Homeland Security-funded prototypes will likely remain in place so the Border Patrol can use them to help demonstrate how the agency operates, officials at San Diego Border Patrol said. Some may serve as designs for replacements of aging sections of the 654-mile (1,052 km) fence that already extends along the almost 2,000-mile border. Later this month, tests are due to begin on the prototypes to determine how easily immigrants could climb over or dig under them, methods of entering the United States illegally that proved successful in the past.   Standing around 40 meters (130 feet) from the Mexican border, the concrete rectangles created a depressing landscape, said Tijuana resident Alexis Franco, 22, who watched their construction since it began in late September.  This is just going to be a nuisance for all of us who live here,  Franco said outside his dirt-floor home, speaking over the noise of heavy machinery on the other side of the border.    If it s not the machines, it s the constant movement of the workers, including some who speak Spanish,  he added. Guadalupe Garcia, 38, who lives on an unpaved street nearby, said she felt powerless to protest even though the construction din often woke and frightened her baby.  Unfortunately, we can t do anything about it,  she said.  It s another country, but it s affecting us.  ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
U.N. calls again for end of U.S. embargo on Cuba,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday adopted a resolution calling for an end to the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, with the United States voting against it after abstaining last year for the first time in 25 years. The 193-member General Assembly passed the resolution with 191 votes in favor. Israel, as it has done in the past, voted  in line with its top ally. The non-binding resolution urges the United States to repeal the embargo on Cuba as soon as possible. The U.N. vote can carry political weight, but only the U.S. Congress can lift the full embargo, put in place more than 50 years ago. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called the plenary meeting on this subject  political theater.   The Cuban regime is sending the warped message to the world that the sad state of its economy, the oppression of its people, and the export of its destructive ideology is not its fault,  Haley told the General Assembly.  The U.S. position had been announced on Tuesday at the State Department. Cuba s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said Haley and the United States lack  the slightest moral authority to criticize Cuba,  calling her remarks  disrespectful  against Cuba and its government. Tensions have flared recently between Washington and Havana, which forged a closer relationship under former U.S. President Barack Obama and reopened embassies in both countries in 2015. Haley said the diplomatic status between both countries is not changing. U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this month he believed Havana was responsible for a series of alleged incidents that Washington says harmed 24 of its diplomats, while Cuban officials said last week talk of acoustic strikes was  science fiction.

Saudi-led air strike kills 26 people in Yemen: medics,"DUBAI (Reuters) - An air strike by a Saudi-led military coalition killed 26 people at a hotel and an adjoining market in Yemen s northern Saadah province on Wednesday, according to medics and a Reuters witness. The attack, which struck the Sahar district of the vast territory that borders Saudi Arabia, demolished the budget hotel and reduced market stalls outside to a heap of twisted sheet metal. Medics retrieved corpses from the rubble.  The military alliance led by Saudi Arabia has launched thousands of air strikes against Yemen s armed Houthi movement, which hails from Saadah and now controls much of the country. The coalition said in a statement carried on state news agency SPA that it was looking into media reports of the strike and would release its findings after a comprehensive review. The 2-1/2 year war effort has yet to achieve its goal of restoring to power the internationally recognized government, but the conflict has unleashed one of the world s worst humanitarian crises and killed at least 10,000 people. Saudi Arabia and its allies, which receive logistical and intelligence help from the United States, accuse the Houthis of being a proxy of Iran.  The Houthi group denies those charges and says it is conducting a patriotic resistance against outside aggressors in thrall to the West. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Ecuador president removed as head of ruling party as feud deepens,"QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador s ruling Country Alliance party, founded by former president Rafael Correa over a decade ago, has removed President Lenin Moreno as its head, citing  repeated failures  in leadership, as a schism between the former allies deepens. The Country Alliance party, which has been divided by the two politicians, late on Tuesday announced that Correa ally Ricardo Patino, a former foreign minister, would replace Moreno as party leader.  The head of the national Country Alliance party has unanimously decided,  it said in a statement announcing  the immediate removal of Lenin Moreno as president of the Country Alliance party.  Ecuador s government, however, said it did not recognize the decision and stressed Moreno remained the head of the party.   Country Alliance is a political party, not an estate ... These actions are wrong and do not reflect the feeling of our political base,  acting vice president Alejandra Vicuna told journalists on Tuesday. Moreno, a Correa prot g  who previously served as his vice president, was elected earlier this year to succeed the fiery leftist. At the time, opposition critics warned Moreno would be a puppet of political heavyweight Correa, whom they accused of seeking to stage a presidential comeback in 2021. But Moreno, a paraplegic former United Nations special envoy on disability, has stunned the Andean country of around 17 million by quickly breaking with Correa, who is now living abroad, in his wife s home country of Belgium.      Moreno, who is seeking presidential term limits via a referendum to revise the constitution, has sidelined another top Correa ally from the vice presidency, and is overseeing a corruption probe that has ensnared former high-level officials. Vicuna replaced Jorge Glas, who was also Correa s vice president, after Glas came under investigation in a corruption scandal centered on Brazilian construction company Odebrecht. He is currently in jail. Polls indicate Moreno has widespread popular support in Ecuador. His approval levels have jumped from around 66 percent in May, when he was sworn in, to about 77 percent in September, a recent survey by local pollster Cedatos showed.  Many Ecuadoreans report being satisfied with his attempts to investigate corruption and boost social welfare. His conciliatory temperament is also welcomed by some who were tired of Correa s confrontational style. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Grief-stricken families of Japanese abducted by North Korea pin hopes on Trump,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Takuya Yokota vividly remembers clutching a flashlight and running to the ocean with his mother and twin brother to look for his older sister in the dark, shouting her name. Megumi, then 13, had disappeared on her way home from school on a cold November day 40 years ago, kidnapped - it emerged decades later - by North Korean agents to help train spies. None of them has ever seen her again, one of scores Japan believes were snatched away in the 1970s and 80s.  Our house was thrust into a bottomless darkness,  Yokota, nine at the time, told Reuters.  Every day after that was silent and hard.  Now, as tensions rise after North Korean missile launches over Japan and nuclear tests, U.S. President Donald Trump has made Megumi s case part of his attacks on Pyongyang. He mentioned her in a September speech at the United Nations and during his Japan visit next week plans to meet her parents and other families whose loved ones were stolen. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made the abductions a keystone of his political career and said he won t rest until all 13 of those Pyongyang admits to kidnapping have returned and divulges information about the others Japan suspects were taken. Megumi Yokota has become the poster child for the cause. But progress has largely stalled since 2002, when five of the 13 returned home. Pyongyang said the other eight, including Megumi, were dead.  Trump is the third U.S. president abductee families have met, following George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Yokota hopes the Trump meeting will give the issue new life. With Abe in charge, Megumi s return may be closer, although Yokota shows hints of impatience with Abe, in office since late 2012.   I d like (Abe) to put his reputation and his government on the line and lead this issue to a resolution,  he said. Toru Hasuike, the brother of abductee Kaoru Hasuike, one of those who returned to Japan, says the Trump meeting is merely a nod to Abe s conservative base.  This is a performance, making political use of them,  he told Reuters, referring to the Yokotas.  Asking America for help is strange. It s our country, so the Japanese government should take responsibility to help them.  Raising the issue will generate more awareness, but progress is unlikely, said Robert Boynton, a journalism professor at New York University and author of a 2016 book on the abductions.  The sad thing is I think the North Koreans are playing a waiting game - waiting for people like the Yokotas to pass away, that the next generation won t be as exercised and the issue will just go away,  Boynton said. Takuya Yokota hopes to once again meet the older sister who doted on her twin brothers.  I think of her at work, I think of her before I sleep,  he said.  When it gets cold and the snow falls ... I wonder if she s warm enough. I think of this every day.  ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Exclusive: U.S. pursues direct diplomacy with North Korea despite Trump rejection,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday, despite U.S. President Donald Trump s public assertion that such talks are a waste of time. Using the so-called  New York channel,  Joseph Yun, U.S. negotiator with North Korea, has been in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang s United Nations mission, the official said, at a time when an exchange of bellicose insults between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has fueled fears of military conflict. While U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Oct. 17 said he would continue  diplomatic efforts ... until the first bomb drops,  the official s comments were the clearest sign the United States was directly discussing issues beyond the release of American prisoners, despite Trump having dismissed direct talks as pointless. There is no sign, however, that the behind-the-scenes communications have improved a relationship vexed by North Korea s nuclear and missile tests, the death of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier days after his release by Pyongyang in June and the detention of three other Americans. Word of quiet engagement with Pyongyang comes despite Trump s comments, North Korea s weapons advances and suggestions by some U.S. and South Korean officials that Yun s interactions with North Koreans had been reined in.  It has not been limited at all, both (in) frequency and substance,  said the senior State Department official.     Among the points that Yun has made to his North Korean interlocutors is to  stop testing  nuclear bombs and missiles, the official said. North Korea this year conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and has test-fired a volley of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that, if perfected, could in theory reach the United States mainland. The possibility that Pyongyang may be closer to attaching a nuclear warhead to an ICBM has alarmed the Trump administration, which in April unveiled a policy of  maximum pressure and engagement  that has so far failed to deter North Korea. At the start of Trump s presidency, Yun s instructions were limited to seeking the release of U.S. prisoners.      It is (now) a broader mandate than that,  said the State Department official, declining, however, to address whether authority had been given to discuss North Korea s nuclear and missile program. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China welcomed any dialogue between the United States and North Korea.  We encourage North Korea and the United States to carry out engagement and dialogue,  Hua told reporters, adding that she hoped talks could help return the issue to a diplomatic track for resolution.  NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged all United Nations members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against North Korea, which he said has emerged as a global threat. Speaking at the United Nations on Sept. 19, Trump vowed to  totally destroy  North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies, raising anxieties about the possibility of  military conflict. Twelve days later, after Tillerson said Washington was probing for a diplomatic opening, Trump said on Twitter that his chief diplomat was  wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man  - his mocking nickname for the North Korean leader. Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday they said would prevent Trump from launching a nuclear first strike on North Korea on his own, highlighting the issue days before the Republican s first presidential trip to Asia. A high-ranking North Korean defector said in Washington on Tuesday that he backed the Trump administration s policy of pressuring Pyongyang through sanctions, coupled with  maximum engagement  with the leadership and increased efforts to get information into North Korea to educate its people.   I strongly believe in the use of soft power before taking any military actions,  Thae Yong Ho, chief of mission at Pyongyang s embassy in London until he defected in 2016, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The New York channel is one of the few conduits the United States has for communicating with North Korea, which has itself made clear it has little interest in serious talks before it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the continental United States. The last high-level contact between Yun and the North Koreans was when he traveled to North Korea in June to secure the release of Warmbier, who died shortly after he returned home in a coma, the State Department official said. The Trump administration has demanded North Korea release three other U.S. citizens: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song.  Warmbier s death was a factor in the chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time but the biggest impact came from Pyongyang s stepped-up testing, the official said. The official said, however, that  the preferred endpoint is not a war but some kind of diplomatic settlement  and   suggestions that Washington is setting up a binary choice for Pyongyang to capitulate diplomatically or military action were  misleading.  Diplomacy, the official said,  has a lot more room to go.  But Trump s threats against North Korea are believed to have complicated diplomatic efforts. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Danish submarine owner has not said how journalist died: police,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A Danish inventor accused of murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on board his submarine did not say she died from carbon monoxide poisoning, police said on Wednesday, correcting an earlier statement. On Monday Danish police said Peter Madsen had told them in an Oct. 14 interrogation that Wall, 30, had died from carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine, while he was on the deck of the vessel. Reacting to comments by Madsen s defense lawyer, the police said on Wednesday he had not specifically said how Wall died but had mentioned the possibility of such a cause of death. Madsen is facing charges of murder, mutilating Wall s body and sexual assault without intercourse, based on 14 interior and exterior stab wounds found on her body. He denies killing Wall but has admitted to dismembering her body and dumping the parts in the sea, police have said. Wall, who was researching a story on Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17-metre (56-foot) submarine in August. On Aug. 23, police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall s. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
UK investigates Brexit campaign funding amid speculation of Russian meddling,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s Electoral Commission is investigating whether a leading anti-EU campaigner breached referendum finance rules, after speculation mounted that Russia may have meddled in the Brexit vote. Arron Banks, a major donor to the anti-EU campaign who was pictured with Donald Trump and leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage outside a gilded elevator soon after Trump s 2016 U.S. presidential election victory, denied the allegations. The Electoral Commission, which is already looking at whether Banks  pro-Brexit Leave.EU group received any impermissible donations, said its new investigation would examine whether he was the true source of loans to a campaigner. The investigation cannot overturn the referendum, though Banks, a 51-year-old insurance tycoon, said it was an attempt by the  Remain establishment  to discredit the Brexit result.  Allegations of Brexit being funded by the Russians ... are complete bollocks [rubbish] from beginning to end,  Banks said in an emailed statement, signing off  nostrovia , a version of  na zdorovye , Russian for  cheers! . When asked about the investigation, Prime Minister Theresa May told parliament:  We take very seriously issues of Russian intervention, or Russian attempts to intervene, in electoral processes or in the democratic processes of any country.   The announcement of the investigation comes after Ben Bradshaw, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, asked the government to look into reports by advocacy group Open Democracy that the origin of some campaign funds was unclear. Bradshaw said he was also concerned about what he said were significant British connections in the U.S. investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian efforts to meddle in the presidential election.  Russia denies meddling in Brexit or the U.S. election and Trump denies any collusion with Russia. In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million votes, or 51.9 percent of votes cast, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million votes, or 48.1 percent of votes cast, backed staying, a result that defied opinion polls. The Electoral Commission, which did not mention Russia, said it was looking at whether a company called Better for the Country Limited (BFTCL) - of which Banks was a director - was the true source of donations made to campaigners. BFTCL was not registered as a permitted participant in the referendum but five registered campaigning groups reported receiving donations from it totalling 2.4 million pounds, the Commission said. Banks, who was a registered permitted participant, gave three non-commercial loans to Leave.EU, totalling 6 million pounds. Participants in the referendum were only allowed to accept donations from donors that conformed to a strict set of rules, for example they could not be based outside the UK. The Commission said in April it was investigating Leave.EU s funding as well as looking at whether its spending return was complete.  Questions over the legitimacy of funding provided to campaigners at the referendum risks causing harm to voters  confidence,  said Bob Posner, director of political finance and regulation at the Commission.  It is therefore in the public interest that the Electoral Commission seeks to ascertain whether or not impermissible donations were given to referendum campaigners and if any other related offences have taken place,  he said. The Commission has the power to impose fines and other sanctions if it finds rules were broken. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1

Syrian opposition rejects Russia-sponsored peace initiative,"BEIRUT/AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - Syria s opposition rejected a Russian-sponsored initiative to reach a political settlement to the civil war, as Turkey protested against moves to involve Kurdish groups, in an early setback to Moscow s peacemaking bid. Having intervened decisively in the Syrian war in 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad, Russia now hopes to build on the collapse of Islamic State to launch a political process to end the six-year-old conflict. Syria s government has said it is ready to attend the Nov. 18 Sochi congress which is set to focus on a new constitution, saying the time is right thanks to Syrian army gains and the  terrorists  obliteration .  But officials in the anti-Assad opposition rejected the meeting on Wednesday and insisted any talks be held under U.N. sponsorship in Geneva, the scene of a string of failed peace efforts.  The congress amounted to a meeting  between the regime and the regime , said Mohammad Alloush, a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee and a senior official with the Jaish al-Islam rebel group.     The HNC was surprised it had been mentioned in a list of invited groups and would  issue a statement with other parties setting out the general position rejecting this conference,  Alloush told Reuters. The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition (SNC) political opposition group said the congress was an attempt to circumvent  the international desire for political transition  in Syria. Russian air power played a big part in the defeat of rebels in opposition-held eastern Aleppo and other areas last year.   What kind of Syrian-Syrian dialogue will it be under the sponsorship of the (Russian) criminal?  said Eyad Shamsi, another HNC member and the head of a rebel faction. A Russian negotiator said on Tuesday that Syrian groups who choose to boycott the congress risked being sidelined as the political process moves ahead. Russia has invited 33 Syrian groups and political parties to what it calls a  Syrian Congress on National Dialogue . Russian President Vladimir Putin first mentioned the idea of the congress last month, saying he believed Moscow and the Syrian government would soon finally defeat militants in Syria. Helped by Russia s air force and an array of Iran-backed Shi ite militias, Assad has defeated many of the Syrian rebels who were fighting to topple him, leaving them confined to enclaves in the west. Damascus and its allies have also recovered swathes of central and eastern Syria from Islamic State in recent months, while a separate campaign by U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has driven IS from other parts of the country. The separate campaigns are now converging on Islamic State s last strongholds in Deir al-Zor province at the Iraqi border. Russia s decision to invite Kurdish groups which dominate the SDF to Sochi triggered objections from Turkey on Wednesday. Ankara, which views the dominant Syrian Kurdish groups as a national security threat, said it was unacceptable that the Kurdish YPG militia had been invited. Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkish and Russian officials had discussed the issue and that he had held meetings of his own to  solve the problem on the spot . Turkey views the YPG and its political affiliate, the PYD, as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK), which has been waging a three-decade insurgency in Turkey. The head of the PYD indicated on Wednesday his group favored attending the congress. Shahoz Hasan, in written comments to Reuters, said the PYD would advocate for its decentralized model for Syria. Although he did not firmly commit to attending, he said a majority among the PYD and its allies now favored going:  We are discussing it and the majority view is to attend .

Bahrain accuses opposition leaders of spying for Qatar,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain s public prosecutor charged two leaders of the country s banned main opposition party of spying for Qatar on Wednesday, months after cutting ties with the neighboring Gulf monarchy amid a regional diplomatic row. Sheikh Ali Salman, secretary general of al-Wefaq party, and Sheikh Hassan Sultan are accused of colluding with Qatar to carry out  hostile acts  in Bahrain and damage its national interests and prestige, according to a statement on state news agency BNA. The men met Qatari officials as well as affiliated agents inside Lebanese Shi ite militia Hezbollah, the statement said. It accused them of transferring confidential information and receiving financial support from Qatar. The prosecutor ordered that both men be taken into custody. Salman s wife Alya Radhi wrote on Twitter that she had spoken by phone with her husband, who denied all charges. There was no immediate comment from al-Wefaq. Salman is already serving a four-year prison sentence for inciting hatred and insulting the interior ministry, after he was arrested in 2015. He was summoned and interrogated about the new accusations in the presence of his lawyer, the statement said. It did not elaborate on whether Sultan was detained. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of financing terrorism. Bahrain and close ally Saudi Arabia believe Qatar is fomenting unrest in the island kingdom by supporting protests and sporadic attacks against security forces, backed by arch-rival Iran. Both countries deny the charges and say the boycott is an attempt to rein in support for reform in Bahrain. The Sunni-ruled kingdom, where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based, has been on edge since 2011  Arab Spring  protests led by its Shi ite majority were put down by the government with the help of fellow Gulf Arab states. The government banned al-Wefaq and revoked the citizenship of the country s top Shi ite Muslim cleric as part of a crackdown on the opposition. Human rights groups accuse Bahrain of clamping down on dissent and violently cracking down on protests, charges the government rejects. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
"South Sudan media regulator bans press groups, raising censorship fears","NAIROBI (Reuters) - South Sudan s media regulator has suspended all press associations in the country while they register for licences to operate, journalists said, a move that raised concern about a possible crackdown on independent media. The directive, handed to South Sudan s three associations this week and seen by Reuters on Wednesday, gave them seven days until Nov. 7 to obtain operations licences or face permanent closure.  We have applied, but we do not know whether our application will be accepted or not,  said Mary Ajith, chairwoman of the Association of Media Development in South Sudan, a grouping of journalists.  This is ... harassment from the media authority that is being done to us.   Officials from both the government information and the National Communication Authority were not immediately available for comment.  Another journalist said the directive would give the National Communication Authority powers to  command every single activity with the support from the national security agency . The move is the latest example of what rights activists say is an increasingly hostile and restrictive approach by the government towards the press in the world s youngest country. In July, four news websites and blogs - including the Dutch-backed radio station and website Radio Tamazuj - were either blocked or had transmissions partially restricted. Foreign correspondents have also faced difficulties in reporting from South Sudan, with at least 20 reporters being denied entry by authorities early this year. Since its establishment in 2015, journalists in South Sudan say the body has made it extremely difficult to obtain permits to travel outside the capital Juba on reporting trips. It also requires prior permission for filming, at a hefty cost. South Sudan, which won independence from Sudan in 2011, plunged into civil conflict in December 2013. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Twelve North African stowaways sent home after three-month ferry ordeal,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Twelve North African migrant stowaways have been repatriated after being stuck on a ferry sailing back and forth between Turkey and Ukraine for three months, the ferry operator said on Wednesday. With neither Turkish nor Ukrainian authorities willing to accept the migrants, the men had been locked in their cabins while the ferry continued taking goods and passengers between Istanbul and Odessa. Denmark s DFDS, which owns and operates the ferry, said a special task force set up by the Danish Foreign Ministry helped find a diplomatic solution so the men could return home. Six of the men, who boarded the ferry hidden in trailers with goods from Turkey, were identified as Algerians and sent home on Oct. 29. The other six were on their way back to Morocco on Wednesday. The men had to be locked in guarded cabins because they had a tendency to be violent, a DFDS spokesman said. DFDS had invited authorities from the United Nations aboard to question the men, while the Danish Foreign Ministry held talks with Turkey, Ukraine and Lithuania, under whose flag the ferry was sailing, to resolve the situation.

Gentiloni seen as Italy's most trusted political leader: poll,"ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni remains Italy s most trusted leader while the 5-Star Movement s Luigi Di Maio has moved into second place, overtaking former premier Matteo Renzi for the first time, according to a poll published on Wednesday. The Ixe survey of the leaders of the main parties said 39 percent of voters had confidence in Gentiloni, who took office in December after Renzi resigned following defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform. Italy is due to hold national elections by May and Renzi says he will be candidate for prime minister for his Democratic Party (PD). Gentiloni, also a PD member, is expected to fall back into the ranks when parliament is dissolved. Some 27 percent said they had faith in Renzi, against 32 percent backing for Di Maio, who was picked to be the prime ministerial candidate for the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement in September, boosting his profile and standing. In the last Ixe leadership survey in August, Gentiloni had an approval rating of 32 percent, Renzi was on 25 percent and Di Maio on 18 percent.  People probably find Gentiloni s composure reassuring,  Roberto Weber, who carried out the Ixe poll, told Rai Radio. Matteo Salvini, the far-right leader of the Northern League party, had a rating of 27 percent, and Giorgia Meloni, head of the rightist Brothers of Italy party, was on 26 percent.  Their ally Silvio Berlusconi, who sees himself as the natural head of the centre-right bloc, was adrift on 21 percent. In the previous survey, he and Meloni were both on 17 percent. Opinion polls put the 5-Star and PD parties roughly neck-and-neck on around 27 percent, with the Northern League on 15 percent, Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party on around 13 percent and Brothers of Italy on just under 4 percent. A new electoral system voted into law last month is likely to produce a hung parliament at the forthcoming ballot, with no one party or coalition coming anywhere close to winning enough seats to govern alone.

Relatives of Philippine drug war victims call for justice,"MANILA (Reuters) - The families of thousands of victims in the Philippines  bloody war on drugs mourned on Wednesday at gatherings in churches and cemeteries in the capital, Manila, to call for justice.   Priests at a special Catholic service on a gloomy All Saints Day prayed for and blessed photographs of those killed, and some relatives held a protest outside a police station whose officers have been blamed for deaths. President Rodrigo Duterte unleashed his signature anti-narcotics campaign immediately after taking office in June last year. Human rights groups believe many of the 3,900 deaths in police operations were summary executions. The police deny the accusations, saying the drug suspects were armed and had violently resisted arrest. Thousands of Filipinos flocked to cemeteries on All Saints  Day, known as  Todos Los Santos,  to pay their respects to the dead by cleaning tombstones, placing flowers and lighting candles.   One important reason for celebrating  Todos Los Santos  with the families is to remember their loved ones and draw inspiration and courage to seek truth and justice for those killed because of this war on drugs,  Catholic priest Gilbert Billena said during the service. Nearly 80 percent of the Philippines  population of 100 million is Catholic, the vast majority of whom still practice with enthusiasm. Relatives sang hymns and wept, surrounded by placards calling for justice beside photographs of the slain, while a poster nearby read,  Address the roots of drug addiction.   Normita Lopez, whose second-born Djastin Lopez was gunned down by police in May, mourned over her son s tomb at Manila s largest public cemetery.  Sometimes I talk to him, I tell his picture,  Son, please visit me. I want to see you. I want to hug you, because I wasn t able to,  Lopez said.   I really miss him now. I miss him so much. I miss his laugh. I miss his company.  Lopez said her 25-year-old son had been accidentally caught in a police anti-drug sweep near their slum community in Manila and was allegedly framed for the death of a resident they did not know. There was no immediate response to a Reuters  text message to a police spokesman to seek comment. Police have earlier said those targeted in anti-drugs operations were involved in the drug trade or figured on a drugs watchlist. Last month, Duterte ordered police to withdraw from the anti-narcotics campaign and leave all operations to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, following scrutiny of police conduct.

Australia's famed Uluru outback monolith to be closed to climbers,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s world-famous Uluru, formerly known as Ayers Rock, will be closed to climbers from 2019, its management board said on Wednesday, ending a decades-long campaign by Aborigines to protect their sacred monolith in the Northern Territory. A board of eight traditional owners and four government officials voted unanimously to close the rock to climbers, a spokesperson told Reuters.  The climb is a men s sacred area, the men have closed it,  chairman Sammy Wilson added in a statement.  It has cultural significance that includes certain restrictions.   The UNESCO World Heritage-listed 348-metre (1,142 ft) rock, known for its shifting red-ochre colors, is a top tourist drawcard, attracting around 300,000 visitors each year, despite its remote desert location near Alice Springs. The traditional owners of Uluru, the Anangu people, have called for the climb to be closed since 1985, when the park was placed in indigenous hands.  The rock s board said in a report in 2010 that they would close the attraction to climbers if the proportion of visitors who tried to climb it dropped below 20 percent. They took the matter to a vote on Wednesday after data showed the number of climbers had fallen below that threshold, from about three quarters throughout the 1990s to just 16.2 per cent between 2011 and 2015. The ban will take effect on Oct. 26, 2019, exactly 34 years after Uluru was handed back to its traditional owners. Australians are still the most common visitors to climb the rock, followed by the Japanese, according to Parks Australia. The climb is closed about 77 percent of the time due to dangerous weather or cultural reasons.  There have been 36 confirmed fatalities at Uluru since records were first kept in the 1950s, with the most recent in 2010.

Germany issues arrest warrant against Syrian bomb plot suspect,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A German federal judge issued an arrest warrant on Wednesday against a 19-year-old Syrian man detained on suspicion of planning a bombing attack, the Public Prosecutor s Office (GBA) said in a statement. Police detained the man, identified only as Yamen A. under German privacy laws, on Tuesday and prosecutors said they believe he had planned an Islamist-motivated bomb attack with the aim of killing as many people as possible. He had been in contact online with jihadists including one who described himself as a  soldier of the caliphate , a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor s office said. Yamen A. was arrested in the northeastern town of Schwerin. Police searched his home and also those of other people not suspected of being directly involved. The arrest comes one month before the first anniversary of an attack in Berlin by a failed Tunisian asylum seeker who killed 12 people by plowing a truck into a Christmas market.

German Greens make stand on car emissions in coalition talks,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Greens said on Wednesday that any coalition government they join would have to agree to make carmakers introduce mechanical changes to engine and exhaust systems to cut toxic emissions. Transport is among the policy areas being thrashed out in talks taking place between Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, who are aiming to form a coalition by Christmas.  The parties are discussing all policy areas before launching detailed negotiations. While the atmosphere has improved in recent days, there have been few actual deals, with immigration and climate change among the biggest sticking points. The Greens  demand on carmakers would go further than software fixes so far agreed between politicians and German car bosses to help repair the industry s badly damaged reputation. The future of Germany s mighty car industry, the country s biggest exporter and provider of some 800,000 jobs, is a tricky area as it tries to recover from the diesel emissions testing scandal which broke at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) two years ago. Despite public concern and planned diesel bans in countries including France and Britain in coming decades, German lawmakers have not yet dared ask the same of its carmakers, such as BMW, VW, Daimler and Porsche who have invested heavily in diesel. In August, politicians and car bosses agreed to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution and avoid bans on polluting vehicles but they stopped short of committing to more expensive hardware modifications. That may have to change if the Greens share power.      We won t meet our targets of getting cleaner air in city centers with software upgrades alone,  Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens, said as he headed into the talks.  There must also be hardware solutions.  Ozdemir said the auto industry was going through the biggest transformation process in its history and the car had to be reinvented to make it emission-free and more automated. Public transport must also be expanded, he added. The conservative bloc, comprising Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavaria s Christian Social Union (CSU), oppose any demand to ban the combustion engine from 2030.

"Syrian Kurds favor attending Russia-backed peace talks, party head says","BEIRUT (Reuters) - The head of Syria s main Kurdish political party indicated on Wednesday his group favors attending a Russian-sponsored peace congress later this month, the first time the Kurds would participate in a major diplomatic push to end the war. Shahoz Hasan said his Democratic Union Party (PYD) would advocate for its decentralized model for Syria, which it says is the only way to end the six-year-old conflict that has made half of Syrians homeless and killed hundreds of thousands.  We tabled the democratic federal solution in mid-March of 2016, and without it there are no solutions but only rendering the Syrian crisis permanent,  Hasan, PYD co-chair, said in written responses to questions from Reuters. Although he did not firmly commit to attending the Nov. 18 peace conference in the Russian Black Sea city of Sochi, he said a majority among the PYD and its allies now favored going:  We are discussing it and the majority view is to attend . The PYD has emerged as one of the most powerful players in Syria since the eruption of the civil war in 2011. Its armed affiliate, the YPG, controls swathes of northern Syria where Kurdish-led local administrations have been set up. They are allied to the United States as the core of the Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) that, with U.S. air support and ground advisers, drove Islamic State from much of northern Syria and captured the militants  de facto capital Raqqa last month. The main rebel groups fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad are planning to boycott the Nov. 18 peace congress in Sochi, which Moscow says will focus on a new constitution.  But attendance by the PYD could be important if it yields steps toward rapprochement between the Russian-backed government and the U.S.-backed Kurds, which between them now control most of the country. The Kurds and the government have largely avoided fighting each other during the multi-sided civil war, with both concentrating instead on fighting other enemies such as Islamic State and Arab rebels hostile to both Assad and the YPG. The PYD says it is not fighting to win independence, but to ensure any post-war constitution gives autonomy to regions. In September, its administrations held the first part of a three-phase election that will conclude in January with the establishment of a parliament. Syria s foreign minister said in September that Kurdish autonomy demands were negotiable. But Damascus recently toughened its stance, declaring on Sunday that Raqqa was under SDF  occupation  and the city would only be considered liberated once the Syrian army recovered it. Hasan said this showed Damascus was  moving away from the democratic solution  and returning to its old stance  that there is no revolutionary movement in Syria and that the pre-2011 Syria can be recreated .  This vision is counter to reality and stands against the democratic solution,  said Hasan, who was elected to his post in September, replacing Saleh Muslim. He added that solving the crisis required a three-year period of political transition. Hasan did not respond to a question of whether the PYD would seek Assad s removal from office, the core demand of the Syrian opposition. The YPG has previously said it would have  no problem with the regime  if Kurdish rights were guaranteed.   The invitation to Sochi marks the first time the Syrian Kurds have been asked to attend a major peace conference. The PYD has been left out of diplomacy in line with the wishes of Turkey, which views it as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers  Party that has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. Hasan said  the broad lines and fundamental elements that guarantee the solution  should be agreed ahead of time, otherwise the congress would amount to  a media carnival .

Suspected Islamist arrested after knife attack near Tunis parliament,"ETTADAMEN,(TUNISIA) (Reuters) - A suspected Islamist militant wounded two policemen with a knife near the parliament in Tunis on Wednesday and was later arrested, Tunisia s Interior Ministry said. It was a rare incident in a country that has improved security since deadly attacks in 2015. The assailant was known to authorities and said after the attack that he considered the police to be  tyrants , the statement said. One of the policemen was taken to hospital for treatment after being wounded in the neck, while the other was only lightly wounded, it said.   I saw a young man with a thick beard trying to kill a policeman. He put the knife in his neck before he was pursued by a second policeman,  a witness told Reuters.  He shouted  Allahu Akbar  (God is greatest) as he attacked the policemen.  The Interior Ministry said Wednesday s suspect had confessed that  he had adopted Takfiri thought three years ago and believes that killing security forces is a form of jihad .   Takfiri thought  refers to a view that Muslims should proclaim other Muslims to be infidels and justify attacks against them. Large numbers of police were deployed to the Bardo square in the aftermath of the attack, a witness said. Blood could be seen on the ground in the square. The square is opposite the parliament building and close to the Bardo museum, where 21 people, mostly European tourists, were killed in an attack by three gunmen in March 2015. A security source told Reuters the attacker was 25 and from Ettadamen - one of the largest, poorest suburbs of Tunis.  I know him well, he is the youngest in a family of six brothers including a sister who works in the parliament s administration , Hamid one of the attacker s neighbors told Reuters. Colonel Major Khelifa Chibani of Tunisia s national guard named the attacker as Zied Gharbi. Security forces raided his house and confiscated his personal computer and other items, he said. Sofian Sliti, a spokesman for judicial counter-terrorism investigations said that  the attacker planned to join terrorist groups in Libya . As well as the Bardo killings, Tunisia suffered two other major attacks in 2015, one against tourists at the beach resort of Sousse and the other against presidential guards in the capital. The 2015 attacks severely damaged the economy, which has a large tourism sector at its Mediterranean beaches. Since then, security has been boosted at strategic sites while authorities have cracked down on militants, dismantling dozens of cells. Tunisia was the only Arab country where a long-serving leader was toppled in the region s 2011 uprisings without triggering civil war or large-scale violence. Tunisian democracy activists who kept dialogue open between Islamists and secularists were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Japan's Abe re-elected prime minister after big election win,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Shinzo Abe was re-elected prime minister on Wednesday after his ruling bloc s big election win last month and days ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump that is expected to be dominated by concerns over a volatile North Korea. Abe, 63, took office in December 2012, promising to reboot the stale economy and bolster defense. His Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition retained its two-thirds  super majority  in parliament s lower house in the Oct. 22 election, reenergizing his push to revise the post-war, pacifist constitution. Abe was expected to reappoint current cabinet ministers and tell them to compile an extra budget for the year to March 31, 2018 focusing on child care and boosting productivity. In a telephone conversation on Monday, Abe and Trump agreed to work together on steps to counter Pyongyang s nuclear and missile development.  Trump told Abe  he is looking forward to his visit to Japan, that Japan and America are 100 percent together and there is no room to doubt the Japan-U.S. alliance,  Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters. The two leaders have developed a close personal relationship since Trump was elected, and plan to play golf together during Trump s Nov. 5-7 visit to Japan.  ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
"New Turkish party could cost Erdogan support, dislodge main opposition: poll","ANKARA(Reuters) - A new Turkish political party founded by a former minister and vocal critic of Tayyip Erdogan could cost the president crucial support and potentially unseat the main opposition, a poll suggested on Wednesday. The survey by prominent polling firm Gezici showed that the Iyi Parti ( Good Party ), founded this month by the breakaway nationalist lawmaker Meral Aksener, could mark a dramatic shift in Turkish politics, eclipsing the secular CHP that dominated Turkish politics for large parts of the republic s history. While only five members of the 550-seat parliament have joined Aksener s party, the survey suggested it could win over voters from several parties, including Erdogan s Islamist-rooted AK Party as well as secular or nationalist groups. Although Turkey s next elections are not due until 2019, pollster Gezici asked 4,638 respondents how they would vote in the event of a snap election.  Support for Erdogan s ruling AK Party, which has been in power since 2002, would fall to 43.8 percent, from 49.5 percent in the November 2015 parliamentary polls, the survey showed.  Aksener s party would win 19.5 percent of the vote, beating the secularist People s Republican Party s (CHP) 18.5 percent, it showed. That would mark the first time since 2002 elections that the CHP - established by Turkey s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk - was not the main opposition. The CHP won 25 percent of votes in 2015. The nationalist MHP, where Aksener previously served as a lawmaker and interior minister, and the pro-Kurdish HDP were both seen falling below the 10 percent threshold needed to enter the 550-seat parliament. The MHP was seen polling at 8.8 percent, from 11.9 in 2015. The HDP, whose leaders have been jailed in the crackdown that followed last year s failed coup, was seen taking 7.0 percent, from 10.8 in 2015. Gezici was one of the most accurate pollsters on the results of April s referendum to change the constitution.  The poll was conducted between Oct. 10-15, days before the widely expected announcement of the formation of the Iyi Parti. Respondents were asked to choose from a list of potential political parties, including  Aksener s party .  Aksener was expelled last year from the nationalist MHP, the smallest of three opposition parties in parliament, after launching a failed bid to unseat party leader Devlet Bahceli, whose support helped Erdogan to a narrow victory in the April referendum that expanded his authority. Since her expulsion, the 61-year-old has become one of the most prominent voices in the country, frequently criticizing Erdogan and the government. In the case of the Iyi Parti not participating in potential snap elections, the AKP would win just over 47 percent, while the CHP would earn 26.8 percent, the poll showed. The AKP, founded by Erdogan, has held a majority in parliament for nearly 15 years. After winning almost 50 percent of votes in 2015, Erdogan and party officials said they aimed to win more than half the votes in the coming general elections.

Myanmar blames Bangladesh for delaying accord on repatriating Rohingya,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar insisted on Wednesday it was ready to set up a repatriation process for Rohingya Muslims even as more risked their lives fleeing the country, but it voiced fears Bangladesh was delaying an accord to first get international aid money. A senior Bangladesh home ministry official described the accusation as outrageous. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled predominantly Buddhist Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh since late August to escape violence that accompanied a brutal military counter-insurgency operation after Rohingya militant attacks on security posts in Myanmar s Rakhine State. Stung by international criticism and accusations of ethnic cleansing, Myanmar s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has said Rohingya refugees who can prove they were resident will be accepted back. But for now, the flow of people is one-way, with Rohingya still preferring to risk being destitute in Bangladesh rather than stay in Myanmar in fear of their lives. Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Suu Kyi, said Myanmar was ready to begin the repatriation process any time, based along the lines of an agreement with Bangladesh that covered returns of Rohingya to Myanmar in the early 1990s. He said Bangladesh had yet to accept those terms.  We are ready to start, but the other side did not accept yet, and the process was delayed. This is the number one fact,  Zaw Htay, Director-General of the Ministry of the State Counsellor s Office, told journalists on Tuesday. A memorandum of understanding on border liaison posts was signed with Bangladesh Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan following talks in the Myanmar capital, Naypyitaw, last week, but there was no progress on reviving the old agreement.  Zaw Htay linked the delay by Bangladesh to the money raised so far by the international community to help build gigantic refugee camps for the Rohingya.  Currently they have got $400 million. Over their receipt of this amount, we are now afraid of delaying the program of deporting the refugees,  he said in comments carried in a front-page article in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper on Wednesday.  They have got international subsidies. We are now afraid they would have another consideration as to repatriation,  he said. A senior Bangladesh home ministry official gave a scathing response.   Their claim is outrageous. We are stunned,  the official told Reuters in Dhaka.  How can they say this when everyone knows who are making the delay?   The Bangladesh government issued a statement last Thursday saying that Myanmar had not agreed to 10 points put forward by its minister at last week s talks, including the full implementation of the recommendations of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, chaired by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, for a sustainable return of Rohingya. Khan told Bangladesh media last Friday that the two sides were unable to form a joint working group but said it should be set up by the time Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali goes to Myanmar for further talks on Nov. 30. The United Nation s new interim resident coordinator for Myanmar began his new job on Wednesday. Knut Ostby, a Norwegian, has stepped into the key humanitarian and diplomatic role at a time of growing strains with the Myanmar government over the handling of the Rohingya crisis. Meantime, while Myanmar and Bangladesh work out how Rohingya can eventually go home, the grim exodus from Myanmar continues. Seven Rohingya, including three babies and two children, drowned making the perilous sea crossing up the coast from Myanmar to Bangladesh earlier this week. Given the horrors endured by many Rohingya now living in refugee camps it would be unsurprising if they were in no hurry to return to their old home. U.N. investigators interviewing Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh said on Friday they had gathered testimony pointing to a  consistent, methodical pattern  of killings, torture, rape and arson. A worry for Myanmar as it prepares to scrutinize any returnees is the risk of Islamist militants sneaking into the country, as several groups, including al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), have called for a jihad to fight for the Rohingya.

Bangladesh police arrest pilot 'suspected of air attack plot',"DHAKA (Reuters) - A pilot with the Bangladesh national carrier Bangladesh Biman was arrested on Wednesday suspected of terrorism offences, including plotting to keep passengers hostage and flying a plane into the houses of top government leaders, police said. Sabbir Enam, 31, was detained on Tuesday and formally arrested on Wednesday, a senior police official said. Rapid Action Battalion, the special security force of Bangladesh police, arrested him and three others, including his mother, said Mufti Mahmud Khan, a director of the RAB responsible for the legal and media wing of the force. He told Reuters that Sabbir had close links with the militant group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and was planning to fly a plane into the residences of top government leaders.  He also had plans to take a flight, keeping passengers as hostage, (and heading) to some Middle Eastern country,  Mufti said. No further details of the plans, or if or when they were ever to be carried out, were immediately available. The arrested pilot was not available for comment. JMB is an Islamic militant organization which in 2005, detonated 500 bombs at 300 locations across the country. Its aim is to set up an Islamic state. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1

South Africa's unruly ANC branches kick off race to succeed Zuma,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s ruling African National Congress (ANC) is holding hundreds of branch meetings as grassroots members nominate candidates to take over from President Jacob Zuma as party chief in December. The frontrunners are Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former chair of the African Union and Zuma s ex-wife, but with several other senior ANC figures running, the contest is too close to call. The ANC s next leader will probably become president in 2019 given the party s electoral dominance. First they face the tough task of winning back voters disillusioned with Zuma s rule and investors spooked by ratings downgrades. The fractious, sometimes violent, branch meetings start the decisive final stretch of the race to succeed Zuma, whose rule has been marred by corruption allegations and a sharp economic slowdown. Ramaphosa, a former union leader and one of the country s richest people, is viewed more favourably by foreign investors, who help cover the country s deficits. Many of them are unsettled by Dlamini-Zuma s calls to radically redistribute wealth and change the ownership structure of the central bank. Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma s campaign teams did not reply to requests for comment on reports of intimidation and manipulation of the nomination process in some provinces.  The real fight is in December, but psychologically the battle for the soul of the ANC has begun,  said Stan Itshegetseng, who chaired a branch meeting in the Diepkloof district of the sprawling Soweto township on Sunday. It took 11 hours for Itshegetseng s branch of over 320 members to nominate Ramaphosa for ANC president, recommend more than 20 other officials for the party s National Executive Committee and agree on a delegate to send to the December party conference. Nominations in the branches matter because they send 90 percent of the more than 5,000 delegates who will vote in December. Branch meetings started last month and are due to end in mid-November. For a factbox on the ANC leadership contest, see: Unless change comes under the ANC s next leader, some analysts believe the ANC could lose the 2019 election, a once unthinkable scenario for a party that has led comfortably since sweeping to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994. As the ANC s electoral majority has shrunk, so the battle for control of the party has intensified between the factions backing Dlamini-Zuma and Ramaphosa. Zuma and the ANC s youth and women s leagues he controls want Dlamini-Zuma, while Ramaphosa is backed by a diverse group of labor unions, communists and ANC members who say the party has lost its way under Zuma. Provincial ANC leaders are split. Carol Sono, a branch member in Diepkloof, said Dlamini-Zuma s stints as health minister, foreign minister and home affairs minister meant she was the most qualified.  It s only because of patriarchy that she wasn t chosen sooner,  Sono said. Kedi Saletese, a branch secretary in the Orlando district of Soweto, said only Ramaphosa could tackle corruption and help the ANC reclaim its image as a defender of ordinary South Africans.  Now people see the ANC as a stepladder to enrich themselves. It makes you ashamed to wear an ANC T-shirt,  she said. Saletese s branch - like Itshegetseng s in Diepkloof - nominated Ramaphosa on Sunday. The Gauteng province, where Soweto and the country s commercial capital, Johannesburg, are based, is an area where Ramaphosa enjoys strong support. Ramaphosa also polls well in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo provinces, whereas Dlamini-Zuma is likely to receive a greater share of votes in provinces including her native Kwa-Zulu Natal and Mpumalanga, where the premier is viewed as a Zuma ally. Earlier this year there was a spate of political killings in Kwa-Zulu Natal, and some officials have expressed concern there could be more bloodshed as the leadership race nears its climax. At the three branches Reuters visited in Soweto on Sunday, there was no sign of violence, though a coordinator for Ramaphosa s campaign said he had been threatened with being  taken out permanently  for his choice of leader. Activists for Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma mingled with party members, urging loyalty before the nominations began. As Ramaphosa supporters emerged victorious from their branch meeting in Diepkloof, they started singing  Things will change . ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1

German railway under fire for proposal to name train 'Anne Frank',"BERLIN (Reuters) - German rail operator Deutsche Bahn is facing a siege of online criticism over a proposal to name a high-speed train after Holocaust victim Anne Frank, who was deported by train to the Auschwitz concentration camp. The idea to name the high-speed ICE 4 train after Frank came from proposals made by Deutsche Bahn customers and the German public, which a panel reviewed. Of 19,400 submissions, Anne Frank was one of the most popular names, it said.  Aware of the historical responsibility we bear, we made a deliberate decision to help keep Anne Frank s memory alive,  Bahn said in a statement.  It was not our intention to disrespect the memory of Anne Frank in any way whatsoever.  Critics say the plan was insensitive. Frank was deported from her home in Amsterdam and taken to Auschwitz by train in September 1944. She was later moved the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she died in early 1945. Iris Eberl, a conservative Bavarian lawmaker, said on twitter the plan was  disrespectful. Mirjam Wenzel, director of the Jewish Museum in Frankfurt, where Frank was born, tweeted that the idea was  based on historical amnesia . The Anne Frank House, the museum that preserves the family s hiding place in Amsterdam, said in a statement that the idea of naming the train after her  is painful for the people who experienced these deportations, and causes fresh pain to those who still bear the consequences of those times within them.

"Two years after the Paris attacks, France ends state of emergency","PARIS (Reuters) - Two years after militants killed 130 people in coordinated attacks across Paris, France officially ended a state of emergency, replacing it with the introduction of a new security law which critics say undermines civil liberties. The new anti-terrorism law, effective from Wednesday, gives police extended powers to search properties, conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut mosques or other locations suspected of preaching hatred.  Some dread that now that we are out the state of emergency there could be a drop in vigilance, it is the opposite,  French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told journalists during a short visit to police officers guarding the Eiffel Tower in Paris.  The level of threat is high everywhere in the world,  he said, referring to the attack in New York on Tuesday where a pickup truck driver killed eight people. The new legislation transposes some of the measures contained in the state of emergency rule into law, although with some modifications. One measure will allow the Interior Ministry, without approval from a judge, to set up large security perimeters in case of an identified threat, restricting movement of people and vehicles and with power to carry out searches inside the area. Conservative politicians warn the regulations are not going far enough while human rights groups and members of the left fear police misconduct.  France has become so addicted to the state of emergency that it is now injecting several of these abusive measures into ordinary law,  Human Rights Watch said before parliament backed the legislation last month. France s human rights watchdog, an independent body, has said it is concerned about breaches of rights of Muslims. The French Council of the Muslim Faith, the official interlocutor with the state in the regulation of Muslim religious activities, said it would remain vigilant about the bill s implementation. However, the concerns expressed by such rights groups have had little resonance with the public so far. A poll conducted in early October showed more than 80 percent of support for the bill. The government says the state of emergency has helped intelligence agencies to thwart more than 30 attacks.  President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday Islamist militancy remained the biggest security threat to France. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1

"Kurdish leader departs, leaving nephew faced with reconciliation","ERBIL Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish President Masoud Barzani departed office on Wednesday, leaving his nephew to reconcile with the central government in Baghdad, with regional neighbors and with rival Kurdish parties after a failed referendum on independence. Nechirvan Barzani, who has served alongside his uncle as prime minister, will now be the main authority figure in the executive of the Kurdish autonomous region, following Masoud Barzani s departure as president, Kurdish officials said.  The prime minister will be the key person during this transitional period,  said Hoshyar Zebari, a former Iraqi foreign minister, now advisor to the Kurdish government and senior member of the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).  The elder Barzani, a 71-year-old veteran guerrilla leader, had run the Kurdish autonomous region with a firm hand since 2005, during which it prospered while the rest of Iraq was mired in civil war. But he announced his resignation on Sunday, effective on Nov. 1, after a Sept. 25 referendum on independence backfired, prompting the central government to send troops to recapture territory held by the Kurds outside their autonomous region. The referendum and government backlash have also revealed deep divisions among the Kurds themselves. During his resignation speech, Masoud Barzani accused his political rivals of  high treason  for yielding territory without a fight. His nephew Nechirvan, 51, who has served as prime minister for all but three years since 2006, is seen in Kurdish politics as a less polarising figure, having warmer relations than his uncle with rival Kurdish parties. He also has a close working relationship with Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan, who has backed Baghdad in the central government s dispute with the Kurds since the referendum. The Kurdish regional parliament voted on Sunday to divide the president s powers among parliament, the judiciary and the cabinet, until parliamentary and presidential elections are next held. The elections were originally scheduled for Nov. 1 but postponed last month until next year. Before the referendum, Barzani s son Masrour was seen as his likely successor, but he has been damaged by his backing of the secession vote, which soured relationships with Baghdad and regional powers who opposed it. On Monday, the United States commended Masoud Barzani for stepping down and said it would actively engage with Nechirvan Barzani and his deputy, Qubad Talabani, a member of the rival political faction with whom he maintains a good relationship. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also spoke with Nechirvan Barzani on Monday to encourage dialogue with Baghdad. He also met with met with the French and Germany ambassadors to Iraq, Bruno Aubert and Cyrill Nunn, on Tuesday. As prime minister, Nechirvan Barzani has been central to brokering the semi-autonomous region s oil dealings, now in jeopardy following Iraq s recapture of disputed territories on Oct. 16, including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Despite no longer being president, Masoud Barzani will not be retreating from public life, government officials said.  In his televised address on Sunday announcing the end of his presidency, Barzani said that he would remain a Peshmerga, or Kurdish fighter, and will continue to battle for his people s lifelong dream of independence. He will also remain head of the ruling party and will still sit on the High Political Council, a non-governmental body which emerged after the referendum. Kurdish politics have been dominated for decades by the KDP, led by three generations of the Barzani family, and its main rivals the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), led by the family of Jalal Talabani, who died in October. The two parties fought a civil war against each other in the 1990s, but maintained an outward appearance of unity after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, with Jalal Talabani serving as Iraq s ceremonial president in Baghdad from 2005-2014 while Masoud Barzani ran the Kurdish autonomous region.

Man arrested after trying to sell original of Bosnia's peace treaty,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A Bosnian Serb man was arrested after trying to sell an original document from the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that ended Bosnia s war, police said on Wednesday. The document had gone missing a decade ago. Media identified the man as Zeljko Kuntos, a former driver for a Bosnian Serb ex-parliament speaker, and said he had been trying to sell the document for 100,000 Bosnian marka ($60,000). The U.S.-brokered peace treaty that ended the war was reached at a U.S. air base in Dayton, Ohio in November 1995 by the then presidents of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia, the three sides involved in the conflict in which more than 100,000 died. Under the treaty, Bosnia was split into two autonomous regions, the Federation shared by the Bosnian Croats and Muslim Bosniaks, and the Serb-dominated Serb Republic.  The person Z.K., who obtained during 2017 the original document written in English of the Dayton peace agreement, is suspected of offering it for sale in order to gain illegal benefits,  police said in a statement. They gave no further details. In 2008, a then presidency member revealed that the original document of the peace treaty in English was missing.  Kuntos was arrested on Thursday in Pale, the Bosnian Serb wartime stronghold near Sarajevo.  It is not clear how he obtained the document.  ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Springer Nature blocks access to certain articles in China,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Springer Nature, which publishes science magazines Nature and Scientific American, said on Wednesday it had pulled access to a small number of articles in China to comply with regulations, adding that it viewed the move as regrettable but necessary. The decision comes after Britain s Cambridge University Press (CUP) said in August it had removed from its website in China about 300 papers and book reviews published in the China Quarterly journal, after a request from the Chinese government. CUP, the publishing arm of elite Cambridge University, later reversed its decision and reposted the articles, following an outcry from academics, who attacked the decision as an affront to academic freedom. In a statement, Germany-based Springer Nature said that less than one percent of its content had been  limited  in mainland China.  This action is deeply regrettable, but has been taken to prevent a much greater impact on our customers and authors,  it said.   This is not editorial censorship and does not affect the content we publish or make accessible elsewhere in the world. It is a local content access decision in China done to comply with specific local regulations,  it added. The Financial Times said at least 1,000 Springer Nature articles had been blocked in China, containing sensitive key words like Taiwan, Tibet and Cultural Revolution. Under President Xi Jinping, Beijing has stepped up censorship, tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society, and strengthened Communist Party authority over academia and other institutions. Beijing said in September that Chinese importers of foreign publications must verify the products were legal. China s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment sent after office hours.  In not taking action we ran the very real risk of all of our content being blocked,  Springer Nature said.  We do not believe that it is in the interests of our authors, customers, or the wider scientific and academic community, or to the advancement of research, for us to be banned from distributing our content in China.  Cambridge University Press had said it had blocked articles on topics including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the 1960s Cultural Revolution and Tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in the country.

"Gunfire heard in Eritrea's capital as protests break out, U.S. embassy says","NAIROBI (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in Eritrea said it has received reports of gunfire in several parts of the capital, Asmara, after protests erupted in one of Africa s most secretive nations.  The embassy advises U.S. citizens to avoid the downtown area where protests appear to be more prevalent,  it said in a statement late on Tuesday.  Avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place and exercise caution when in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations.  It was not immediately clear what had caused the protests. Opposition outlets said the incidents were triggered after the government tried to close down an Islamic school in a predominantly Muslim district.  In some footage posted online, shots are heard being fired to disperse crowds. Via Twitter, Information Minister Yemane Ghebremeskel downplayed the protests, saying:  Small demonstration by one school in Asmara dispersed without any casualty.  Eritrea, which sits on the Red Sea coast next to one of the world s busiest shipping lanes, seceded from Ethiopia in 1991 after a three-decade war for independence.  Conflict broke out once again seven years later over a border spat with neighboring Ethiopia, and the UN has since accused the government in Asmara of committing crimes against humanity under the guise of national security.  A U.N. Commission of Inquiry report last year said that atrocities - including an indefinite military national service program that amounted to mass enslavement - had been committed since the country s independence and were ongoing. Eritrea denies the charges. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Netherlands to hold referendum on new surveillance law," AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Netherlands will hold a referendum on legislation giving law enforcement authorities far-reaching surveillance powers, the Dutch Voting Commission said on Wednesday.  A range of activists, politicians and media groups want to overturn the  tapping law , which was passed by parliament in July and allows agencies to gather data covertly from large groups of people at once.  Dutch law obliges the government to hold a non-binding referendum if a petition with at least 300,000 signatures is submitted to the Voting Commission.  The agency said it had received more than 384,000 valid signatures and that the referendum would be held on March 21 together with municipal elections.  Opponents argue that innocent civilians will be dragged into the sights of intelligence agencies, while the government says the powers are needed to counter national security threats.  The referendum law is itself controversial and may be repealed by the newly appointed right-of-centre government under Prime Minister Mark Rutte.  After it was passed in 2015, a referendum was used to block the Dutch government from ratifying an economic treaty it and other European Union countries had negotiated with Ukraine.  A large  no  vote on the referendum embarrassed The Hague and forced Rutte to seek minor amendments to the treaty with the other EU states, eventually leading to the Dutch ratifying it.  It later emerged that the signatures to hold the Ukraine referendum were gathered via the internet and never vetted.  ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
"UK Labour activist says she was raped, advised not to report it","LONDON (Reuters) - An activist in Britain s opposition Labour Party has said she was raped at a party event when she was 19, and that a party official discouraged her from reporting the attack to avoid damaging her career. The disclosure by Bex Bailey, 25, is the most serious to emerge from a wave of allegations of sexual misconduct by powerful men that have swept through British politics in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has ordered an investigation into the allegation, said Bailey was not given support from the party when she reported what had happened.  Bex Bailey has shown incredible bravery by talking publicly about what has happened to her and has my full support and solidarity,  he said in a statement on his Facebook page.  There will be no tolerance in the Labour Party for sexism, harassment or abuse. Whatever it takes, we are absolutely committed to rooting it out.  A party spokesman said:  We would strongly recommend that the police investigate the allegations of criminal actions that Bex Bailey has made.  Bailey told BBC radio on Tuesday that she was raped in 2011 by someone in the party who was senior to her. She said she had tried to pretend it hadn t happened and had not reported it to police at the time.  I was scared. I felt ashamed. I know that the Labour Party, like any family, loves a good gossip, and I didn t want people to know and I also was worried that I wouldn t be believed if I did,  she said. Two years later, she told a senior party staff member, and it was suggested to her that she should not report it as it might damage her if she did. She was given no advice on what she should do next.  That might be their genuine view, it might be that that was the case, in which case that shows that we have a serious problem in politics with this issue anyway,  said Bailey, a former member of Labour s National Executive Committee. She called for an independent agency such as a charity to deal with allegations rather than someone within the party  who is inclined to be loyal to the Labour Party . Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered investigations into two of her ministers after allegations were made against them. Her deputy Damian Green denies making an advance on a woman three decades his junior, while junior trade minister Mark Garnier has said he was being humorous when he asked his assistant to buy sex toys for him.

"Cargo ship with 10 crew sinks in Black Sea, coast guard reports","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish cargo ship with 10 crew on board sank in the Black Sea near the Asian side of Istanbul early on Wednesday morning, according to the coast guard. The cause was still unclear. The ship, Bilal Bal, was carrying cast iron from Turkey s northwestern province of Bursa to the northern province of Zonguldak, the Dogan news agency reported.  Unfortunately, one of our cargo ships sank in ... the Black Sea,  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said. Search and rescue operations were continuing, he said. Three boats, one helicopter and one plane belonging to the coast guard were conducting search and rescue operations, according the coast guard.

Russia won't hand over suspect in Montenegro coup attempt: RIA,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will not hand over to Montenegro the person wanted by the Balkan nation as a suspect in a coup attempt, the RIA news agency cited the Russian prosecutor general s office as saying on Wednesday. Montenegro says a group of Serb and Russian nationalists had a plan to attack state institutions on the day of an election last year and kill then-Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who held the post for a total of 21 years. The Kremlin has dismissed the accusation as absurd.

Philippines arrests Indonesian pro-Islamist militant in Marawi,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine security forces on Wednesday arrested an Indonesian national suspected to be among the pro-Islamist militants who seized control of parts of the southern city of Marawi in May, military and police officials said. The seizure stoked concerns that the region had become a hub for Islamic State in Southeast Asia, triggering a five-month military effort to eject the militants, comprised of domestic fighters and foreigners such as Indonesians, Malaysians and Middle Easterners.  Community peacekeepers arrested the Indonesian on Wednesday morning, Colonel Romeo Brawner, deputy commander of the Marawi task force, told reporters. The arrest highlights that  civilian participation is essential in our collective effort to secure our communities from terrorist elements,  Zia Alonto Adiong, a politician who is assisting in rescue and relief, said in a statement. The arrest came a day after a pro-Islamic State militant was gunned down and nine days after the Philippines wrapped up military operations. More than 1,100 people, mostly militants, died in the siege, which drove about 350,000 from their homes. The militant identified himself as Muhammad Ilham Shaputra, 23, from Medan City in North Sumatra, said John Guyguyon, police chief of the province of Lanao del Sur, where Marawi is located. His bag held a mobile phone, a .45-caliber handgun, a fragmentation grenade and Philippine and Indonesian currencies, along with some riyals, while he tried to escape through a lake, Guyguyon added.  Our action is to file a case against him because he is part of the initial siege,  Guyguyon told a news conference.  We are preparing the investigation report so we can file cases of rebellion, terrorism and others,  Guyguyon said, adding that the Indonesian confessed there were several gunmen still  hiding in the main battle area in downtown Marawi. The Indonesian militant arrived in the Philippines in November last year at the invitation of Isnilon Hapilon, the Islamic State s emir in Southeast Asia, who was killed in Marawi last month, Guyguyon said. Thousands of residents have started returning home, only for some to find dwellings ransacked. But the main battle area remains off limits, until possible booby traps and unexploded ordnance have been cleared.     ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
"Southeast Congo faces 'deadly disaster', half a million people displaced: NGO","ABIDJAN (Reuters) - More than half a million people have fled ethnic violence in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo since last year, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said on Wednesday, warning that the area is  on the brink of a deadly disaster .  Four years of clashes between militias representing the Luba, a Bantu ethnic group, and Twa pygmies in Tanganyika province have killed hundreds of people and forced thousands to flee into neighboring Zambia. The conflict, which appears to have intensified in recent months, is part of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Congo. Militia violence has spiked this year, fueled in part by President Joseph Kabila s refusal to step down when his constitutional mandate expired last December.   Tanganyika is on the brink of a deadly disaster,  said Ulrika Blom, NRC s Congo country director, in a statement.  It s a catastrophic cocktail about to blow up.   The United Nations declared Congo a level three humanitarian emergency last month - the highest possible classification and on par with Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Nearly 4 million Congolese are internally displaced.  NRC, an independent aid agency, said that over 80 percent of the people sheltering in displacement sites it visited over the last two weeks in Tanganyika do not have access to clean drinking water.  The conflict in Tanganyika is driven by inequalities between Bantu villagers and the Twa, a hunting and gathering people historically excluded from access to land and basic services. Some 600,000 children are also on the brink of starvation in central Congo s Kasai region, where a local insurrection has killed up to 5,000 people since August of last year, the World Food Programme s executive director said on Monday. Millions died during regional conflicts in eastern Congo between 1996-2003, most from hunger and disease.  ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1

Russia's Medvedev says the world shouldn't be dominated by one currency,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Russia and China were considering linking their national payment system, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday, as he called for a more balanced global finance structure. Noting the rise of China s Unionpay system and Beijing s efforts to internationalize its currency, the yuan, Medvedev told a press conference in Beijing that Russia was developing its own payment system, known as Karta Mir.  At the present moment it is being discussed whether Karta Mir should be linked to Chinese payment systems,  he said, while standing alongside Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. That would have  good prospects  and  avoid those problems that sometimes arise when you use American payment systems , Medvedev said, mentioning Visa and Mastercard without elaborating. Russia started to create the Karta Mir system after Western sanctions were imposed on the country in 2014, during the Ukraine crisis. The system is now widely accepted in Russia. After new U.S. sanctions were imposed, Moscow promised to intensify work to cut dependence on Western payment systems further. Among other things, it wants to create more domestic financial services such as its own ratings agency.  I think that the more financial instruments there are in the modern world, the more stable the global financial system will be,  Medvedev said. Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to clients of one Russian bank after Washington imposed sanctions over Moscow s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and support of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Around 14 million Mir cards, which translates as  World  or  Peace , have been issued in Russia, according to the Russian National System of Payment Cards (NSPK), or about 10 percent of the country s population.  NSPK was established in 2014 and is 100 percent owned by the central bank. More than 380 banks working in Russia accept the cards, which are issued by 120 banks. Practically all trade and service points, including cafes, shops, restaurants and petrol stations, accept them.  Mir cards are also welcome in sanctions-hit Crimea where Western banks are banned from operating. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Rare protest in junta-ruled Thailand after mourning chaos,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Authorities in Thailand s southeastern Chonburi province braced for more demonstrations on Wednesday after hundreds of furious residents gathered a day earlier in a rare protest to complain about bureaucratic incompetence. Residents complained about long lines that lasted more than 12 hours and general disorganization surrounding activities to mark the funeral of late King Bhumibol Adulyadej who was cremated in Bangkok last week in a $90 million funeral. The protest defied a junta ban on gatherings of more than five people that has been in place since a May 2014 coup. It is also rare because anything remotely related to the monarchy is a sensitive topic in Thailand - the royals are protected by a draconian lese-majeste law, which criminalize all perceived insults toward the monarchy. The Chonburi protests, however, were directed at the local authorities and not at the palace. Protesters in the sea-side province shouted  Get out!  on Tuesday as they demanded that provincial governor Pakarathon Tienchai step down over what they said was poor organization of ceremonies to mark the funeral.  Many wore yellow, the king s color. There have been similar calls for the governor of Nonthaburi province, north of Bangkok, to step down. Some in Nonthaburi reported waiting for up to eight hours to lay flowers for the late king. Chonburi Governor Pakarathon spoke to the crowd on Tuesday and denied his staff had mismanaged the event. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Tuesday urged Thais to forgive those involved in the funeral organization and overlook any problems that arose.  The number of people who took part in the funeral caused a few problems,  he said. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out to see King Bhumibol s funeral in Bangkok last week.  The late king, who ruled for more than seven decades, was seen as a father-figure. For those unable to make the trip to Bangkok, 85 miniature replicas of the cremation pyre were arranged across Thailand. Hundreds of other areas were designated as places for mourners to lay flowers.  I waited 13 hours!  shouted one Chonburi protestor on Tuesday. Similar stories have emerged around the country as netizens took to social media to vent their anger. Some said the mismanagement exposed Thailand s jarring class divide. Chonburi protesters said they were unhappy with the funeral s $90 million budget. The late king frequently spoke about self-sufficiency and was portrayed as a frugal man despite his own enormous wealth. Others still argued that government officials were given preferential treatment when laying flowers.  Officials went first before the public,  Tanarit Kumwivat, form the northern province of Chiang Mai, said in a Facebook post. The Chonburi protest comes at the end of an epoch. King Bhumibol, who was also known as  the people s king , was a rare figure of unity in the politically divided nation and his death has left some Thais anxious about the future.

Libyan coast guard intercepts nearly 300 migrants east of Tripoli,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya s coastguard intercepted 299 migrants from sub-Saharan African countries on two rubber boats east of Tripoli on Tuesday, officials said. The migrants were intercepted near the town of Zliten by one of several coastguard vessels that Italy repaired and delivered to Libya earlier this year. Libya s western shoreline is the main departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by boat, many of them fleeing conflict or poverty. Crossings have dropped sharply since July, when an armed group in the smuggling hub of Sabratha began blocking departures. Under pressure from Italy and other European states, Libya s coastguard has also become increasingly active, patrolling more widely and intercepting migrants before they can reach international rescue vessels. As of Oct. 24, more than 18,800 migrants had been intercepted so far this year, according to the International Organisation for Migration. More than 111,000 had crossed to Italy, the vast majority from Libya.  The group picked up on Tuesday was brought back to Tripoli port and was being transferred to a detention center in Tajoura, a suburb of the capital. It included about 15 children and 25 women, said coastguard official Ali al-Shebrak.  A reporter saw one newborn child crying from hunger as his mother, barely able to walk, was given medical treatment from an ambulance.

British PM May's deputy denies inappropriate sexual advance,"LONDON (Reuters) - Damian Green, number two in the British government, has denied an allegation that he made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman as discussion about an unhealthy culture of abuse by powerful men in British politics continues to swirl. Green, Prime Minister Theresa May s deputy, said it was not true that he had touched the woman s knee and told her that his  wife was very understanding  during a meeting in a pub in which the pair discussed her career aspirations and gossiped about sexual affairs in parliament. As the shockwaves from the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal reverberate around the world, the Westminster parliament is among institutions now facing allegations of improper behavior by men in powerful positions. The allegation against Green came from Kate Maltby, an academic and critic three decades younger than him. She first met him as an acquaintance of her parents, and both are involved in a liberal Conservative group called Bright Blue.  He offered me career advice and in the same breath made it clear he was sexually interested,  Maltby wrote in an article in the Times newspaper describing the meeting in the pub in early 2015.  It was not acceptable to me at the time and it should not be acceptable behavior in Westminster in the future,  she said. A spokesman for May s Downing Street office said Green strongly denied the allegation made against him.  The prime minister has referred the matter to the cabinet secretary to establish the facts and report back as soon as possible,  the spokesman said. Maltby wrote that she had no contact with Green for a year after the meeting in the pub because she  wanted nothing to do with him . A year later, Maltby wrote an article for the Times about the history of corsets, which was published with a picture of her wearing one. After the article appeared, she received a text message from Green that said:  Long time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favorite tabloid I feel impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?  The Times quoted Green as saying:  It is absolutely and completely untrue that I ve ever made any sexual advance on Ms Maltby.  He said the allegation of the advance in the pub was deeply hurtful from someone he considered a personal friend, and that the text he sent her referring to the corset picture was sent in the spirit of friends agreeing to meet for a regular catch-up.

"Detained journalists informed Myanmar of filming plans, Turkish broadcaster says","YANGON (Reuters) - Turkey s state broadcaster said a team of journalists filming a documentary in Myanmar had told the government of their plans before they were detained for attempting to fly a drone near the country s parliament. The journalists, Lau Hon Meng from Singapore and Mok Choy Lin from Malaysia, have been held since Friday in the capital Naypyitaw, along with their Myanmar interpreter Aung Naing Soe and driver Hla Tin. Police have said they are investigating the four for bringing the drone into Myanmar in violation of an import-export rule that carries a penalty of up to three years in jail. The two foreign nationals had obtained official journalist visas before they entered Myanmar on Oct. 21, TRT World, the English-language subsidiary of the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation, said in a statement late on Tuesday.      They shot in various locations with conventional cameras as well as with a drone, up until October 27,  the broadcaster said.  The Myanmar Information Ministry was previously informed about all filming activities and the filming schedule.  The broadcaster did not say if the reporters had specifically sought permission to operate a drone near the parliament building. They had interviewed a lawmaker and were about to film the parliament with a drone when they were detained, it said. Myint Kyaw, an information ministry official in charge of journalist visas, told Reuters that TRT World had only made a broad request to the ministry to film in Yangon and the troubled western state of Rakhine.  The letter they sent was not their schedule. They didn t even mention in their letter about visiting Naypyitaw,  he said, adding that the letter did not mention a drone. Last week s arrests came amid tension between Turkey and Myanmar over treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine. In early September, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said security operations targeting the Rohingya constituted  genocide , a charge Myanmar denies. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled majority-Buddhist Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh since security forces launched a counter-insurgency operation in response to Rohingya militants  attacks on Aug. 25. The families of the two Myanmar nationals and a lawyer hired on their behalf have not been allowed to visit them, family members and police said. On Friday about 25 police raided the Yangon house of their interpreter Aung Naing Soe, a freelance reporter, seizing his computer memory sticks and searching documents. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called for the immediate and unconditional release of all four.   These arrests and the raid of Aung Naing Soe s home speak to the continuing deterioration of conditions for the press in Myanmar,  Shawn Crispin, CPJ s senior Southeast Asia representative, said in a statement on Monday.

Turkish activist charged with trying to overthrow government: media,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Prominent Turkish rights activist and businessman Osman Kavala has been jailed pending trial, charged with seeking to overthrow the government, state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Wednesday. An Istanbul court remanded Kavala in custody as part of an investigation into the movement of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, which Ankara accuses of carrying out an attempted coup in July last year, the agency said. It said Kavala was charged with  attempting to overthrow the constitutional order  and  attempting to overthrow the government of the Republic of Turkey . Kavala, whose Anadolu Kultur organization is involved in promoting culture and rights, was detained nearly two weeks ago at Istanbul s Ataturk Airport, prompting expressions of concern from Europe and the United States.  Since the failed putsch on July 15, 2016, more than 50,000 people have been jailed as they face trial and some 150,000 sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service and private sector. The U.S. State Department described Kavala s initial detention as an example of a  very alarming trend  of detention of civil society leaders, journalists, academics and activists in Turkey. The Turkish government says the measures are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it faces. Gulen has denied involvement in last year s attempted coup. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1
Australian citizenship crisis claims another lawmaker,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A citizenship crisis that robbed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of his one-seat majority will claim another politician, with the Senate president on Wednesday saying he will resign after confirming he was a dual national. Stephen Parry, the leader of the upper house and a member of Turnbull s Liberal party, said he will submit his resignation on Thursday after he being told that along with his Australian citizenship he also held British citizenship by descent. Parry s father was born in Britain before moving to Australia as a boy in 1951, which automatically gave Parry citizenship by descent. Under the constitution a politician must only hold Australian citizenship to be eligible to be elected to the national parliament.  I wish my successor all the best and trust that she or he will continue the reforms that I have commenced,  Parry said in a statement. Parry s resignation follows last week s High Court ruling that the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, was ineligible to sit in parliament as he held dual Australia-New Zealand citizenship when elected. The ruling meant the government lost its one-seat majority in the lower house and must now rely on independents for its political survival. Joyce has since relinquished his New Zealand citizenship and will re-contest his seat at a Dec. 2 by-election. Joyce was one of a group of lawmakers, known as the  Citizenship Seven , whose eligibility to sit in parliament was thrown into doubt in recent months when it was found they were dual citizens. The High Court last Friday also ruled four other politicians ineligible to sit in parliament due to dual citizenships. Turnbull does not control the Senate, and Parry s departure will not change the dynamics of the upper house where seats are assigned to party alternatives when an incumbent resigns. Turnbull has flagged potential changes to the constitution, noting that more than half of Australia s population of 24 million was either born overseas or has a parent who was born overseas. A national referendum would be needed to change the constitution. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
"Asylum seekers refuse to leave Papua New Guinea camp despite loss of power, water","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hundreds of asylum seekers refused to leave a detention center in Papua New Guinea on Wednesday, even after power and water  were cut and food supplies dwindled, in a stand-off that human rights groups warn could become a humanitarian crisis. Australia and PNG are trying to close the Manus Island center, one of two remote Pacific camps that Canberra uses to detain asylum seekers who arrive by boat. The camps have drawn widespread international condemnation.  The remote Manus island center has been a key part of Australia s disputed  Sovereign Borders  immigration policy under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, detaining them instead in PNG and Nauru in the South Pacific. Around 600 detainees on Manus island are defying the attempts to close the camp, saying they fear violent reprisals from the local community. The men refused to board a bus to a transit center on the island on Wednesday, three of the asylum-seekers told Reuters, frustrating Australia s plans to dismantle part of its costly offshore detention program.  They took generators this morning and they cut the main pipes, there is no power in the whole center and no water,  Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz told Reuters.  People are extremely anxious.  The asylum seekers, warned that utilities would be cut, had begun to collect rainwater in bins. However, without running water, advocates fear a rapid decline in sanitary conditions of the camp. The loss of power also threatens to dampen morale of the detainees, nearly all of whom are suffering from mental health issues, according to a United Nations report in 2015.  Mobile phones are a lifeline for these men,  said Elaine Pearson, director of Human Rights Watch in Australia.  They are completed isolated and they need phones to get real-time information about what is happening elsewhere on Manus, as well as to stay in touch with their families.  The detainees were sharing what food remained but some of the men Reuters spoke to by phone said supplies were running low. They had been given enough meals to last only until the camp s official closure on Tuesday. Acting Australian Prime Minister Julie Bishop said the men should move to the new centers, which Australia has said it would support with A$250 million ($195 million) worth of food and security for the next 12 months.  The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of refugees as part of a refugee swap deal that Australia hopes will see it no longer responsible for the detention of nearly 1,400 asylum seekers who have been classified as refugees. Those not accepted by the United States would likely be resettled in PNG or in another developing country, dashing hopes of coming to Australia. Vehement opposition among Manus residents to the asylum seekers has raised fears within the camp of potential violence, stoked further by the departure of Australian-employed private security guards on Tuesday.  We did not sleep, about 30 guys at one time would keep watch for potential attacks,  said an asylum seeker who asked to be identified only as Imran, due to fears his application for U.S. resettlement could be jeopardized. Lawyers for some of the 600 men filed a last-minute suit in PNG s Supreme Court on Tuesday to prevent the camp s closure and for services to be returned. A ruling is expected later on Wednesday. PNG s High Court ruled last year that the Manus center, first opened in 2001, was illegal. The United Nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centers. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
South Korea's Moon says cannot recognize North Korea as nuclear state,"SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - South Korea will never tolerate North Korea as a nuclear state, nor will Seoul have nuclear weapons, President Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday, as China pledged to work on denuclearization after setting aside a dispute with Seoul over an anti-missile system. The North Korea nuclear crisis will take center stage when U.S. President Donald Trump begins a trip to Asia at the end of the week and diplomacy has being ramping up ahead of that visit. A series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in recent months has raised fears about an armed conflict. Speaking to parliament, Moon said there can be no military action on the Korean peninsula without the South s consent, adding the government will continue working for peace on the peninsula.  According to the joint denuclearization declaration made by North and South Korea, we cannot tolerate or recognize North Korea as a nuclear state. We too, will not develop nuclear (weapons) or own them,  he said.  Our government was launched in the most serious of times in terms of security. The government is making efforts to stably manage the situation it faces as well as to bring about peace on the Korean peninsula.  China s foreign ministry said Beijing and Seoul will continue to use diplomatic means to address the Korean peninsula issue, after a meeting in Beijing between Lee Do-hoon, South Korea s representatives of stalled six-party nuclear talks, and his Chinese counterpart, Kong Xuanyou.  Moon s remarks and China s statement came a day after China and South Korea agreed to normalize relations to end a year-long standoff over the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.   The installation of THAAD had angered China, which feared its powerful radar could see deep into China. South Korea s tourism, cosmetics and entertainment industries bore the brunt of a Chinese backlash, although Beijing has never specifically linked that to the THAAD deployment. North Korea s state media had no comment on the shift in ties between South Korea and China as of midday on Wednesday. It has not engaged in missile tests since mid-September or any nuclear tests since its biggest one early that month.     A senior Blue House official had said warmer bilateral ties had seemed to come about from better trust in Seoul by Beijing, which has expressed concerns regarding possible additional deployments of a U.S. anti-missile defense system and military cooperation among South Korea, the United States and Japan.  Earlier this week, South Korea s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa had said South Korea has no intention to join a U.S. missile-defense system in the region and would not host additional THAAD batteries. South Korea would not enter any trilateral military alliance with the United States and Japan, Kang added.  The United States is deciding whether three aircraft carriers currently in the Asia Pacific will carry out an exercise to coincide with Trump s trip to the region, two U.S. officials said. Japan s navy is considering sending one or more ships to the exercise if it is held, a Japanese government source said. Trump s trip includes Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing but he will not go to the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) on the border of North Korea and South Korea, a senior White House official said. China s top newspaper, the Communist Party s official People s Daily, wrote in a commentary on Wednesday that China expected South Korea to take seriously its responsibility to protect regional peace now that they had set relations back on the correct track.  The appropriate handling of the THAAD issue by China and South Korea can provide an opportunity for both countries to increase cooperation and communication on the peninsula issue,  it said. But influential state-run tabloid the Global Times warned  there would not be an immediate improvement in cultural and business ties, with South Korean firms having to make an effort to win back Chinese customers.  Whether or not Chinese consumers buy South Korean products is not totally up the Chinese government,  it said in an editorial. The rapprochement meant both countries were able to walk away with gains, said John Delury, professor at Seoul s Yonsei University.  It is arguably Moon s first foreign policy breakthrough, giving South Korea s economy a boost and enhancing his geopolitical leverage by strengthening the relationship with China,  said Delury.  But Xi can also claim a victory - he made his point that Seoul needs to factor China s interests more seriously into its security posture, at least when it comes to things like missile defense that can alter the regional balance of power.

Tribal blockade in Peru's oil block lifted after government deal,"LIMA (Reuters) - Indigenous villagers ended a 43-day protest that had halted production in Peru s largest oil block after signing a deal with the government, tribal leaders and officials said on Tuesday. As part of the agreement, the government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski promised to apply an indigenous rights law before awarding any new, long-term oil drilling contract for Block 192   a chief demand of protesters, the energy and mines ministry said in a statement. Canadian Frontera Energy Corp operates Block 192 under a two-year contract but has not produced any oil from it since Achuar, Quechua and Kichwa indigenous tribes seized oil wells on Sept. 18. Protesters wanted the government to clean up oil pollution in the region and to commit to including tribes in talks on long-term oil drilling plans. The blockade was one of scores of conflicts that sometimes disrupt mining and energy operations in Peru, the world s second biggest copper producer and a relatively small oil producer. Talks between the government and Frontera over a long-term drilling contract ended with no deal, state-owned oil company Petroperu announced earlier this month. Aurelio Chino, a chieftain in the Pastaza River Basin, told Reuters that protesters were no longer occupying company installations. A statement by the leaders of 16 villages that took part in the protests said the protest would end. The government also promised villagers that it would start implementation of an emergency healthcare program in the next 10 days and would form a commission to direct environmental clean-ups in Block 192, the ministry said. Frontera will be summoned to take part in dialogue sessions with villagers to discuss their needs, it added. Frontera has said that the protest did not have a not a material impact for the company.

EU MPs threaten Cambodia aid and trade over crackdown,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A European Parliament delegation warned on Tuesday that Cambodia could face EU action over aid and vital trade preferences if the human rights situation worsened further. The delegation s statement was the strongest threat of action from representatives of any Western donors since the arrest of opposition leader Kem Sokha in September and steps by Prime Minister Hun Sen s government to dissolve his Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). The ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Delegation of the European Parliament called for the release of Kem Sokha and an end to the process of dissolving his party.          The government of Cambodia should be aware that the European Parliament is a co-legislator for budgetary and trade issues,  said the delegation s chairman, Werner Langen, a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats party.  A serious deterioration of the human rights situation might have implications for development assistance programs and trade preferences,  he said after a two-day visit. Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at Cambodia s Interior Ministry, said the European Parliament should keep trade and politics separate.  Some members of the European Parliament should distinguish between political agenda and trade for the interests of the people. We need to create many choices rather than make the interests of the people a hostage of a political agenda,  Huy Vannak told Reuters.  Without economic prosperity, democracy will just be an illusion,  he said. European Union countries accounted for around 40 percent of Cambodia s exports in 2016. Its exports, mostly of clothing, get fully duty free access under a scheme to help the world s poorest countries. Western diplomats say in private it would be difficult to secure EU agreement for limiting trade preferences because of the harm it could do to some 700,000 low-wage garment workers employed in Cambodian factories. The European Union and its member states also gave Cambodia nearly $170 million in development aid last year, according to Cambodian government figures. That was still well short of the $265 million it got from China, which is now by far the biggest donor and investor and voiced support for Hun Sen s government after the arrest of Kem Sokha. The government has intensified a crackdown against political opponents, independent media and human rights groups in recent months ahead of an election next July in which Hun Sen s rule of more than 32 years will be at stake. Cambodia s Supreme Court rejected an appeal to free Kem Sokha on Tuesday, saying his release could be a public risk as the threat of dissolution looms over his party. Lawyers for Kem Sokha had asked the Supreme Court to rule that his detention was illegal and said he should be granted parliamentary immunity from prosecution. The Supreme Court is due to rule on Nov. 16 whether to dissolve the CNRP after the government last month filed a lawsuit asking to dissolve it on grounds it was involved in a plot to topple the government. Kem Sokha was not brought to the court hearing on Tuesday.  The hearing seems fake,  Hem Socheat, a lawyer for Kem Sokha, told the court. Hun Sen has said his rival was getting help from the United States. The U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh has rejected any suggestion of interference in politics. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

Spain's High Court calls Puigdemont to testify on Thursday,MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s High Court on Tuesday called former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and 13 members of his sacked administration to testify on Thursday at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT).

'Like any EU citizen': Belgium's Catalan asylum fix,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium has given a cool welcome to Catalonia s ousted leader and may not offer the safe haven from Spanish justice that it once extended as it grapples with separatist troubles of its own. Carles Puigdemont was not invited by the Belgian government, Prime Minister Charles Michel said in a curt statement, a day after he arrived unannounced following his dismissal by Madrid on charges of rebellion over Catalonia s independence bid.  He will be treated like any other European citizen,  Michel said, noting Puigdemont was entitled to move freely within the EU.  He has the same rights and duties ... no more, no less.  Deputy premier Kris Peeters was even brusquer, saying:  When you declare independence, it s better to stay with your people.  Puigdemont himself told a news conference in Brussels that he was there to engage with the European Union   which has shunned his pleas   and not to exploit Belgium s reputation as a place of political asylum for citizens of other EU states.  Nonetheless, he traveled to a small town in western Flanders on Monday to hire a human rights lawyer with a successful track record of fighting extradition to Spain on behalf of Basque separatist sympathizers. The lawyer, Paul Bekaert warned, however, that EU rules have made it harder. He told Reuters that the European Arrest Warrant system had removed exceptions previously made for extraditions to face  political  charges like sedition in other EU states. Politics, too, may play a part. Eighteen months before the next Belgian federal election, there have already been tensions over Catalonia within the coalition, where Flemish nationalists sympathetic to the Catalans are a major force and Michel, a French-speaking liberal, has lately tried to mollify Madrid. On Tuesday, Spain s High Court called Puigdemont and 13 members of his sacked administration to testify on Thursday. It also said it had started processing rebellion and sedition charges against Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders. Bekaert said Puigdemont, who faces up to 30 years in jail if Spanish prosecutors follow through on plans to charge him with sedition and misuse of public funds, saw no hurry to file for asylum, a simple procedure that would halt any extradition. However, asylum requests from EU citizens are rarely accepted nowadays and are often rejected within days.  As an EU citizen, Puigdemont has to demonstrate that there is a clear risk of prosecution against him, that the sentence he could face could be disproportionate, that he doesn t have a fair trial in Spain,  said Dirk Vanheule, a law professor at Antwerp University and president of Belgium s Refugee Council.  If he fails to demonstrate that from the beginning, the asylum proceeding can be terminated within five days.  Koen Lemmens, a human rights lawyer and professor at Leuven University, said the Belgian asylum agency would not take into account potential diplomatic embarrassment. But it would be up to Puigdemont to prove he would not get a fair trial. The Belgian government looks unwilling to back him up. Michel annoyed Spain by speaking out against police violence as people voted in the Oct. 1 independence referendum. But he also slapped down his Flemish nationalist immigration minister for suggesting at the weekend that Belgium might grant asylum. That did not stop the French-speaking Socialist opposition from accusing Michel of damaging Belgium s credibility abroad. The issue may not fade quickly. Any EU citizen can stay for up to three months without permission. And despite support for Madrid from the Belgian government, judges refused in 1996 and again, under new EU rules, in 2004 to extradite Luis Moreno and Raquel Garcia, whom it accused of aiding Basque militants. The N-VA has soft-pedaled demands for splitting the richer, Dutch-speaking half of Belgium off but with elections looming it must be wary of the small, anti-immigration Vlaams Belang, whose leader attended Puigdemont s Brussels news conference. VB leader Tom Van Grieken called on N-VA ministers to break with Michel s refusal to recognize Catalan independence. Mark Demesmaeker, an N-VA member of the European Parliament, told Reuters he met Puigdemont in Barcelona a month ago and said he did have a case for asylum as the EU  looks the other way .  The fact he is coming here already says plenty enough about the situation in Spain and Catalonia,  Demesmaeker told Reuters.  He has no faith in the Spanish judiciary.

No chateau: Catalan leader's modest Belgian exile,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - At 70 euros ($82) a night, with the rumble of the Brussels metro thrown in, Carles Puigdemont is hardly living the high life of a political fugitive charged with abusing public funds. The Catalan leader, ousted by Madrid and facing charges of rebellion and sedition as well as wasting money on a referendum on independence, has been staying since his arrival in Belgium on Monday at the 3-star Chambord Hotel, staff said. And while it may be named after the grandest French chateau on the Loire, once home to the 18th-century deposed King of Poland, it offers rather more modest accommodation for today s exile behind an elegant 1920s Art Deco facade. It does, however, offer a rapid getaway into the adjacent underground station. Puigdemont told a news conference on Tuesday that he had not come for the Belgian asylum which at least one Flemish nationalist government minister has said might be offered, but to lobby the European Union institutions. He forswore, however, staying in the European Quarter itself, and its upscale hotels which regularly house EU heads of state during summit meetings. His plans remain unclear and he has had only the coolest of welcomes from the EU and the Belgian government. With prosecutors summoning him to testify before Spain s High Court on Thursday, Puigdemont may face demands from Madrid for his arrest if he fails to heed the summons. As television camera crews set up outside in the hope of catching Europe s most wanted politician step out for dinner, no Belgian police were visible at the hotel on Tuesday evening.

Factbox: Catalonia crisis - What's next?,"MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia s ousted leader Carles Puigdemont agreed on Tuesday to a snap election called by Spain s central government when it took control of the region to stop it breaking away, but he said the fight for independence would go on. Below are several scenarios of what could happen in the next few days. Puigdemont and his sacked cabinet have been ordered to testify before the Spanish High Court on Thursday and Friday after charges of rebellion, sedition and breach of trust were filed against them. Under Spain s legal system, a judge will then decide whether Puigdemont should go to jail pending a investigation that can sometimes take up to several years - and a potential trial. Puigdemont traveled to Brussels after the Catalan regional parliament issued a unilateral declaration of independence on Friday, and it was not immediately clear whether he would heed the call to appear before the court. He had said earlier on Tuesday he would return to Spain only when given unspecified  guarantees  by the Spanish government.  The same charges have been drawn up against the Catalan parliament s speaker, Carme Forcadell, and other senior lawmakers but, given they have parliamentary immunity, they will testify before the Supreme Court, which is in charge of handling cases relating to lawmakers or members of the government. Prosecutors have asked the courts to order Catalan secessionist leaders to deposit 6.2 million euros to cover potential liabilities but they have not sought preventive jail against them. This could change however if Puigdemont and his associates did not show up at the High Court as the judge could deem them to be a flight risk and jail them. It is not clear whether a snap regional election will resolve the crisis. Two recent opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane.  But an official regional survey published on Tuesday showed some 48.7 percent of Catalans believe the region should be independent, up from 41.1 pct in June and the highest since December 2014.  Based on 1,338 interviews, the Centre d Estudis d Opinio poll was the first survey released since the independence declaration though the bulk of it was taken before then, between Oct. 16 and Oct. 29. Other opinion polls have also shown Catalonia is almost evenly split between pro- and anti-independence supporters. One key thing to watch will be if pro-independence parties run on a joint ticket or on separate platforms. If they ran separately, they could find it more difficult to reach a parliamentary majority. They must say whether they intend to run together before Nov. 7 and then put forward their candidates by Nov. 18. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia s government including Puigdemont and his deputy Oriol Junqueras and assumed direct control over the region. Central government ministries assumed the powers of the Catalan administration until a regional election takes place on Dec. 21. That unprecedented step was implemented smoothly and calls for civil disobedience were widely disregarded. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
"Ousted Catalan leader agrees to election, summoned to Madrid court","BRUSSELS/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia s ousted leader Carles Puigdemont agreed on Tuesday to a snap election called by Spain s central government when it took control of the region to stop it breaking away, but he said  the fight for independence would go on. Spain s High Court issued a summons for Puigdemont and 13 members of his sacked administration to testify in Madrid on Thursday and Friday as the court starts processing charges of rebellion, sedition and breach of trust against them. Under Spain s legal system, a judge will then decide whether Puigdemont should go to jail pending a comprehensive investigation and potential trial. Puigdemont travelled to Brussels after the Catalan regional parliament issued a unilateral declaration of independence on Friday, and it was not immediately clear if he would heed the summons to appear before the Madrid court.  Belgium s crisis centre said it was evaluating whether Puigdemont needed to be protected by Belgian authorities while he was staying in the country, Belga news agency reported. He had said earlier on Tuesday he would return to Spain only when given unspecified  guarantees  by the Spanish government.  Puigdemont s announcement that he would accept the regional election on Dec. 21 signalled the Madrid government had for now at least gained the upper hand in the protracted struggle over Catalonia, a wealthy northeastern region that already had enjoyed considerable autonomy. Resistance to the central government s imposition of direct control on Catalonia failed to materialise at the start of the week and the secessionist leadership is in disarray. But a poll released on Tuesday showed that support for the creation of an independent state of Catalonia rose to an almost three-year high in October. Spain s Constitutional Court on Tuesday blocked the independence declaration - a largely symbolic move that gained no traction and led to the assembly s dismissal by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy less than an hour after it was made.  I ask the Catalan people to prepare for a long road. Democracy will be the foundation of our victory,  Puigdemont  told a news conference in Brussels, where he showed up after dropping out of sight over the weekend. He also said he was not seeking asylum in Belgium. Rajoy, who has taken an uncompromising stance throughout the crisis, is gambling on anti-independence parties taking power in the regional parliament and putting the brakes on the independence drive. Puigdemont will hope a strong showing for the independence camp will reboot the secessionists after a tumultuous few weeks. The Spanish government said at the weekend Puigdemont was welcome to stand in the election. The judicial process was a separate matter, it said. The Supreme Court also began processing rebellion and sedition charges against Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell and other senior leaders on Tuesday.  The political crisis, Spain s gravest since the return of democracy in the late 1970s, was triggered by an independence referendum held in Catalonia on Oct. 1. Though it was declared illegal by Spanish courts and less than half Catalonia s eligible voters took part, the pro-secessionist regional government said the vote gave it a mandate for independence. The United States, Britain, Germany and France have all backed Rajoy and rejected an independent Catalan state, although some have called for dialogue between the opposing sides. Puigdemont, Vice President Oriol Junqueras and other Catalan leaders had said previously they would not accept their dismissal. But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The struggle has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment across the rest of Spain, although separatist sentiment persists in the Basque Country and some other areas. Two recent opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane.  But an official regional survey published on Tuesday showed some 48.7 percent of Catalans believe the region should be independent, up from 41.1 pct in June and the highest since December 2014.  Based on 1,338 interviews, the Centre d Estudis d Opinio poll was the first survey released since the independence declaration though the bulk of it was taken before then, between Oct. 16 and Oct. 29. Despite his dash to the European Union s power centre, Puigdemont s hopes of engaging the bloc in his cause seem forlorn. Member states have asserted their support for Spanish unity and EU institutions in Brussels say they will deal only with Madrid and that the dispute remains an internal matter.  Our position remains unchanged,  EU Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said in Brussels on Tuesday. But some analysts believe the dispute is not going to fade away anytime soon.  Spain is heading for a period of disruption, and like the UK and Brexit, having its policy agenda dominated by one political issue while other key challenges fade into the background,  said Raj Badiani, an economist at IHS Markit in London.  A more tangible impact from the crisis could evolve from early 2018, with the uncertainty set to build as Catalans push harder for a legally binding referendum.    Influential Catalan business lobbies have backed direct rule and called on firms to stay in the region. The crisis has prompted more than 1,000 businesses to switch their legal headquarters from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Spain s IBEX fell slightly as Puigdemont began speaking in Brussels but then rose again. For some in Barcelona, the overwhelming emotion appears to be exasperation.  It s a farcical and completely ridiculous situation,  said Ernesto Hernandez Busto, 42, an editor.  This extreme nationalism, this separatism, has taken Catalonia to the most absurd situation and the worst inconvenience we have had in the last 40 years.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

Six dead after ambush on Malian High Court's president,"BAMAKO (Reuters) - Five Malian soldiers and one civilian were killed in central Mali on Tuesday during an ambush on a convoy of the president of the High Court of Justice, the defense ministry said in a statement.  It was not clear who was responsible for the attack, but the high level target and army deaths point to the deteriorating security situation in Mali due to the growing reach of jihadist groups that roam country s vast desert expanses.  The convoy of Abdrahamane Niang was traveling between the towns of Dia and Diafarab  in the Mopti region, about 500 kilometers (311 miles) northeast of the capital Bamako, when it was attacked.   Mr. Niang and his wife were recovered by the army. However, we report 6 deaths: five soldiers of the Malian army and the driver of the Honorable Niang,  the statement said, adding that others had been wounded.  No other details of the attack were given.  The rise of jihadist groups   some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State   continues to destabilize Mali, four years after French troops beat back an Islamist insurgency that began in 2012.  Around 4,000 French soldiers remain as part of Operation Barkhane, where they work alongside around 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Mali. But attacks on peacekeepers, aid workers and the Malian military are common.  Four U.S. Special Forces troops were killed earlier this month in neighboring Niger by fighters believed to belong to a local Islamic State affiliate operating out of Mali.  The G5 Sahel, an anti-terrorism taskforce of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania, plans to launch its first joint operations this month to target Islamists in the Sahel.

Pregnant U.S. teenager moved to Iraq from Syria: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Tuesday that U.S. forces had moved a person who is under 18 years old to Iraq from Syria and two U.S. officials said she was a pregnant American teenager.  U.S. forces recently relocated a minor from Syria safely to Iraq,  the Pentagon said in a statement.  The U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she was in the hands of State Department officials in Iraq and would travel back to the United States, although they did not say when. While not identifying her by name, one official said she was the same person interviewed by CBS News earlier this month near Raqqa, the Syrian city that Islamic State once called its capital. U.S.-backed militias declared victory in Raqqa earlier this month. In that interview, she said she was 15 and had been brought to Syria by her father, an Islamic State supporter. The teenager had told CBS that she was from Kansas. Last month, the Pentagon said a U.S. citizen fighting for Islamic State in Syria surrendered to U.S.-backed militias and was handed over to U.S. forces. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
"Bahrain imposes entry visas on Qatar nationals, residents","CAIRO (Reuters) - Bahrain said on Tuesday it would impose entry visas on Qatar nationals and residents in what it called a security measure. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of financing terrorism. Doha denies that and says the boycott is an attempt to rein in its support for reform.   The new measures aim at preventing harming the security and stability of the kingdom of Bahrain particularly in light of the latest repercussions of the crisis with Qatar,  said a statement from the official Bahraini news agency BNA. Citizens from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council countries are supposed to be able to travel within the GCC carrying only an identity card. Bahrain s visa requirements will apply from Nov. 10. Ambassador Ali Khalfan Al Mansouri, Qatar s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office in Geneva, said the visas  constitute a flagrant violation of the agreements and resolutions of the Gulf Cooperation Council.   These measures are completely contrary to the statements of officials of the siege countries not to harm the Qatari citizen when taking any steps in the context of this crisis,  Mansouri told the Qatari state news agency. Bahrain believes Qatar is fomenting unrest in the island kingdom by supporting protests and even sporadic shooting and bombing attacks against security forces. Bahrain s foreign minister said on Sunday his country would not attend December s GCC summit if Qatar does not change its policies, and that Qatar should have its GCC membership suspended.

Northern Ireland power-sharing talks to extend into Wednesday,"BELFAST (Reuters) - Northern Ireland s main political parties are to continue talks aimed at restoring the British region s devolved government on Wednesday, a British government official said, in an apparent extension of a deadline for a deal.  Representatives of Irish nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ended their second day of talks aimed at re-establishing a power-sharing government that collapsed in January, the official said.  The British government has indicated that if the parties fail to reach agreement in the coming days it will be forced to impose a budget directly for the first time in a decade to ensure essential services are funded.  A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London, which could destabilize a delicate political balance there. On Monday the British government s minister for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, said if there was no progress by the end of talks on Tuesday he would assess whether London needed to move impose a budget. The spokesman declined to comment when asked when that decision would be made.  The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of violence in the province. Sinn Fein pulled out in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
World Bank approves $400 million to rebuild liberated Iraqi areas,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The World Bank on Tuesday approved $400 million in additional funding to help rebuild services to Iraqi areas recaptured from Islamic State militants after a three-year military campaign, the global development bank said. The World Bank also said it would fund studies on how to involve the private sector in the reconstruction of Mosul s airport and restoring public transport terminals as well as parts of the railway network.  The package represents an additional financing to the Iraq Emergency Operation for Development Project ($350 million) approved back in July 2015 and already underway in seven cities in Diyala and Salah Ad-Din governorates,  the World Bank said in a statement. It said the new funding would focus on rebuilding in five sectors - water and sanitation, electricity, health, transport and municipal services. The funds will also help with the restoration and preservation of cultural heritage sites in Mosul s Old City, which was heavily damaged by fighting.  Iraqi government forces, backed by a U.S.-led coalition, retook Mosul in May - by far the largest city to fall under militants  control - after nearly nine months of urban warfare. Iraqi government officials have estimated it will take at least five years and billions of dollars to rebuild Mosul. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
"Britain accelerates Brexit plans, divorce talks also to speed up","LONDON/BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Britain is accelerating preparations for  all eventualities  when it leaves the European Union, but both sides are hopeful an agreement on stepping up talks to unravel more than 40 years of partnership will be sealed soon. With only 17 months remaining until Britain s expected departure, the slow pace of talks has increased the possibility of it leaving without a deal, alarming business leaders who say time is running out for them to make investment decisions. British and EU negotiators met in Brussels on Tuesday and agreed to hold further divorce talks on Nov.9-10.  The pressure has spurred the British government to step up its Brexit plans, employing thousands more workers and spending millions to make sure customs posts, laws and systems work on day one of Brexit, even without a deal on a future relationship. At a meeting with her ministers on Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May was updated on plans for the tax and customs authority to add a further 3,000-5,000 workers next year and for spending of 500 million pounds ($660.45 million) for Brexit.  Alongside the negotiations in Brussels, it is crucial that we are putting our own domestic preparations in place so that we are ready at the point that we leave the EU,  May s spokesman told reporters.  The preparatory work has seen a significant acceleration in recent months. Departments are preparing detailed delivery plans for each of the around 300 programs underway across government.  May wants to silence critics in her ruling Conservative Party who are pressing her to walk away from talks, which have faltered over how much Britain should pay to leave the bloc, and also to step up the negotiations. Brexit campaigners are demanding that Britain leave with no deal if the talks do not move on beyond a discussion of the divorce settlement on a so-called Brexit bill, EU citizens rights and the border with EU member Ireland by December. Brexit minister David Davis said on Tuesday he believed Britain would agree some kind of basic deal with the European Union, even in the  very improbable  eventuality that they failed to agree a trade deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier reaffirmed his message in the Slovak capital Bratislava that he was ready to  speed up negotiations .  We have clearly proposed three (different dates) for new rounds. In the next few hours or days we ll be working with British delegations to find the right dates because we need to work in a very intense way to find this agreement before December,  Barnier told reporters, in comments that supported sterling.  The agenda for the new round of negotiations will be fixed within hours or days.  May s government has also long said it would welcome an acceleration in the talks.  After a top-level meeting in Brussels on Oct.19-20, Barnier has proposed three more negotiating rounds before the end of the year. London prefers  continued negotiations .  What does  continuous negotiations  mean, we don t know exactly. We are ready to accelerate but we must have something to talk about. We are very happy to increase the number of times we meet,  said an EU official. Before leaving the EU, May faces a struggle to get parliamentary support for a law to sever political, financial and legal ties with the bloc - the EU Withdrawal Bill, for which lawmakers have proposed hundreds of amendments. Asked whether May was preparing to offer a concession over a final vote on any deal struck with the EU, her spokesman said there was  lots of speculation in relation to Brexit .  We ve always said that we ll do whatever is necessary,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
U.S. to vote against U.N. resolution calling for end to Cuba embargo,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States will vote against a U.N. General Assembly resolution on Wednesday calling for the lifting of the decades-old U.S. economic embargo against Cuba, reversing an abstention by Washington last year. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley will vote against the resolution, introduced annually by Havana for 26 years, to underscore President Donald Trump s new Cuba policy, which puts greater emphasis on advancing human rights and democracy, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Tuesday. The United States consistently voted against such resolutions for 24 years but abstained for the first time in 2016 as Washington and Havana forged a closer relationship and reopened embassies in both countries in 2015. But tensions have flared recently between the two former Cold War foes. Trump said earlier this month he believed Havana was responsible for a series of alleged incidents that Washington says harmed 24 of its diplomats. Cuban officials investigating the U.S. complaints said last week talk of acoustic strikes was  science fiction.   The resolution on Wednesday is non-binding but can carry political weight. Only the U.S. Congress can lift the full embargo, put in place more than 50 years ago. The Cuban delegation to the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year, the resolution was adopted by the 193-member General Assembly with 191 votes in favor. Israel joined its ally the United States in abstaining. U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, led a group of 10 senators urging Trump on Tuesday to direct the U.S. delegation to once more abstain from voting.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

Russia invites Syrian Kurds to people's congress: Kurdish official,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russia has invited the Kurdish-led authorities in northern Syria to its proposed congress of Syria s rival parties in November, a senior Kurdish official said on Tuesday, as Moscow seeks to launch a new initiative to end the Syrian conflict.  We are studying the issue and our stance has been positive so far,  Badran Jia Kurd, an adviser to the administration that governs Kurdish-led autonomous regions of Syria, told Reuters. It would mark the first time Syria s main Kurdish groups have been brought into peace talks. Although they now control at least a quarter of Syria, Kurdish authorities have so far been left out of international talks in line with Turkish wishes. After intervening decisively in favor of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia has sought to spearhead diplomatic efforts among the various combatants over the past year. Moscow has said the congress will focus on  compromise solutions  towards ending the conflict, which began more than six years ago with street protests against the Syrian leader. A spokesman for the Syrian opposition, which wants peace talks to take place under U.N. supervision, described the proposed congress as  really worrying . It was unclear what the aims were and who would join, said Yahya al-Aridi. Aridi also said he feared the congress would be used as  fabricated  evidence of reconciliation to mislead both the Syrians and foreign countries. Several rounds of U.N. talks in Geneva between the Damascus government and the anti-Assad opposition have gone nowhere.   Russia invited 33 Syrian groups and political parties on Tuesday to a  Syrian Congress on National Dialogue  which it will host on Nov. 18 in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. They include Kurdish groups and anti-Assad rebel factions.  The Kurdish-led administration received the invitation at meetings with Russian officials in northern Syria last month and favor the idea as it strives for a political solution, Jia Kurd said. Kurdish officials say they have been in talks with Russia to assess the prospects for dialogue with the Syrian government.       Since 2011, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north. Their territorial grip has expanded since they joined forces with the United States to fight Islamic State militants. But Turkey views Syrian Kurdish power as a national security threat along its border. Ankara considers the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK movement that has waged a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey.     Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sent warplanes to help Assad s military against mostly Sunni rebels in 2015, first mentioned the congress earlier this month.  Putin has said it would include  all ethnic and religious groups, and the government, and the opposition .       Syria s U.N. ambassador, Bashar al-Jaafari, said Damascus was ready to take part in the congress and that the time was now more appropriate to join such talks after its military victories.  Since Russia s intervention in 2015, the government has taken back significant territory from rebels opposed to Assad and has this year recaptured swathes of central and eastern Syria from Islamic State. Alexander Lavrentyev, a senior Russian negotiator on Syria, urged Syrian rebel groups to join the congress, provided they support Syria s integrity and sovereignty and status as a secular, democratic state.  If someone is against these principles,.. they will of course not go there,  he told reporters after a round of talks with Turkish and Iranian delegations in Kazakhstan.  But then we think they will risk being sidelined in the political process.  The Kazakhstan talks did not produce an anticipated document on prisoner swaps. Lavrentyev said the sides had spent a lot of time discussing the situation in Idlib where Damascus accuses Ankara of acting in coordination with Islamist militants. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
U.N. condemns civilian deaths from air attack in east Libya,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Air strikes killed at least 15 people in the besieged eastern Libyan city of Derna late on Monday, a medical source and a resident said, in an operation condemned by the United Nations due to the high civilian death toll. The U.N. Support Mission in Libya said at least 12 children and women were among the dead in Derna, a city about 265 km (165 miles) west of the Egyptian border controlled by a coalition of Islamist militants and rebel veterans known as the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC). The medical source said all the victims appeared to be civilians. The coastal city has long been under siege by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which has occasionally carried out air strikes against it, as has Egypt, which backs the LNA. Both denied carrying out Monday s strikes. The air strikes, lasting around an hour, hit the Dahr al-Hamar district in the south of Derna and Al Fatayeh, a hilly area about 20 km (12 miles) from the city, a resident said.  An Egyptian military source said Egypt was not responsible for the air strike, while one Egyptian TV station said Libyan planes had conducted it. The LNA denied this and said there had been a  terrorist attack  in the area. Egypt s foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the air strikes, which it said had killed innocent civilians. The Tripoli-based U.N.-backed government, which opposes the LNA-backed by a rival administration in the east, denounced the air strikes and announced three days of mourning. Islamic State established a foothold in Derna in late 2014, but was driven out by the DMSC the following year. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
"Merkel preaches tolerance, religious freedom at Reformation ceremony","WITTENBERG, Germany (Reuters) - Invoking the spirit of the Reformation, Chancellor Angela Merkel called for religious freedom and tolerance on Tuesday and said Germany should lend extra support to the children of refugees  who have experienced awful things.   We have learned that tolerance is the soul of Europe,  she said at a ceremony on the 500th anniversary of the reformation in Wittenberg, where Martin Luther is said to have nailed his theses challenging Catholicism to a church door. Luther argued against what he saw as abusive practices by Catholic preachers, though the reformation divided western Christianity and resulted in violence, persecution and discrimination. Merkel, the daughter of a protestant pastor, praised Luther s translation of the Bible into a standard form of written German, which she said made its teachings accessible to the population at large.  Religious education was a fundamental concern of the reformation,  she said, stressing the importance of education for everyone.  To learn and develop skills, some children need to be given more support than others - for example when parental support is lacking. This applies too to integrating children from refugee families who have experienced and undergone awful things.  Merkel has come under fire for allowing more than one million migrants to enter Germany over the past two years - a decision that saw her conservatives bleed support to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in a national election last month. People from different backgrounds often knew too little about each other, she said, stressing the importance of dialogue between religions.  Just as the freedom of belief always has to be protected from religious fanaticism, so freedom of worship, on the other hand, requires that religion be protected from contempt,  Merkel added. To honor the 500th anniversary, Reformation Day was a public holiday in Germany this year. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
Man seized over Benghazi attack is Syrian linked to suspected ringleader -Libyan officials,"MISRATA/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - A man seized by U.S. forces in Libya accused of involvement in an attack that killed the U.S. Ambassador in Benghazi in 2012 is a Syrian who had links to the suspected ringleader, Libyan military officials said on Tuesday. U.S. special forces captured Mustafa al-Imam in the past few days and he is being transported to the United States, U.S. officials said on Monday, without giving more details. Speaking on condition of anonymity, eastern-based military officials told Reuters Imam was believed to be a Syrian national aged between 35 and 40. He was captured near Misrata, the country s third-largest city located some 190 km east of the capital Tripoli, said Mohammed al-Ghasri, spokesman of the defense ministry of the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli.  He was caught near the city of Misrata after his movements had been monitored,  Ghasri told Reuters in the first official statement of the Tripoli-based government. When asked whether Libyan authorities had been present during the U.S. operation he only said:  Yes...(there) was coordination with the security agencies inside Misrata city.  He declined to elaborate. The man had been originally from eastern Libya but spent time in Misrata where he had roots while he also had been moving around, Ghasri added.  He did not live in Misrata.  Imam had previously lived in the Benghazi district of Laithi where he frequented the same Al-Awza i mosque as suspected ringleader Ahmed Abu Khatallah who was snatched by U.S. forces in 2014, eastern military officials said. U.S. prosecutors opened their case against Abu Khatallah this month.  Imam has been charged with  killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility  and providing  material support to terrorists resulting in death,  the U.S. Justice Department said. He will appear before a federal judge in Washington when he arrives in the United States. Laithi was an Islamist stronghold that saw some of the heaviest fighting in a battle for control of Benghazi that began in 2014. In July, eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar announced victory in the campaign, which pitted his Libyan National Army (LNA) against Islamists and other opponents. Libya has rival governments: one in the capital and another in the east allied to Haftar. An eastern news agency backing the LNA published what it said was a picture of Imam standing in front of the Benghazi barracks of an armed group before it was taken by Haftar s forces. The Benghazi attack, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton handled the attack.  Libya has been mired in conflict since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, with Islamist militants gaining ground as fighting between rival factions created a security void.

Egypt says bombs militants responsible for Western Desert attack,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s air force killed a large number of militants responsible for a deadly attack on a police convoy 10 days ago, the military said on Tuesday following an air raid on their base. The raid, the second in a week targeting militants behind the Oct. 21 attack, was coordinated with police and based on intelligence about the location of their hideout, a military statement said. Three security sources said at the time that at least 52 police officers and conscripts were killed on Oct. 21 when their patrol came under attack, but the interior ministry refuted that figure the next day and said only 16 policemen had been killed. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi appointed a new military chief of staff a week after the militants struck and the Interior Ministry dismissed several high-ranking officials. Tuesday s military statement said the air strike was a  continuation of the armed forces and police efforts to avenge the martyrs of national duty . A  large number of terrorist elements  died in the strike, and the air force and police were pursuing several militants on the run, the statement added. Three vehicles loaded with large quantities of weapons, ammunition and explosives were also destroyed in the strike, and the military later posted footage of the attack. An official source in the Giza province security directorate told Reuters more than 12 militants had been killed, though a military spokesman did not confirm any death toll. The military spokesman later said in a statement that a police officer who had been kidnapped during the Oct. 21 attack had been rescued and taken to a military hospital. Egypt has been fighting an Islamic State insurgency concentrated in the northern part of the Sinai peninsula since Sisi led the military overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. Hundreds of members of the security forces have been killed since. No group has claimed responsibility for the Oct. 21 attack in a remote desert area of Giza, about 130 km (80 miles) southwest of Cairo. The latest air strike was the second attack on militants in five days - at least 13 militants died in a raid on a farm hideout in the region on Friday.  The vast Western Desert has long been a security headache, with arms flowing across the border with Libya, where militant groups have found shelter since the country fell into chaos after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Dutch authorities try to avoid Russian air ban over Schiphol landing slots,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Authorities in the Netherlands tried on Tuesday to defuse a threat by Moscow to close Russian air space to Dutch planes in a dispute over landing slots at Amsterdam s Schiphol airport.  The Dutch Airline Pilots Association said Russia has indicated it will enforce the ban from Saturday. It would mainly hurt Air France subsidiary KLM, the former Dutch flag carrier and the only Dutch airline that flies over Russia. The dispute centers on a reduction from 23 to 13 in the number of slots available to Russian freight carrier AirBridgeCargo at Europe s third-busiest airport following Schiphol s half-yearly reallocation.on Oct. 28. The Dutch transport ministry is  in talks with several parties over the availability of slots for freight traffic at Schiphol,  said spokesman Roel Vincken, who declined to comment further for fear of negatively impacting the talks. A spokesman for the Russian transport ministry said KLM and AirBridgeCargo were in talks about KLM giving up some of its slots as part of a possible compromise. Russian-Dutch relations have been tense since the 2014 downing of Malaysia passenger flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, which killed 298 people, most of them Dutch.   AirBridgeCargo s Dutch chief Henk-Jan van Keulen said in a telephone interview that his company had been forced to reroute almost half of its traffic through Liege, Belgium, using trucks, because of the reallocation of slots at Schiphol. Van Keulen said financial damages were difficult to estimate, as they are lessened by lower fees at Liege and are being partly borne by the various freight-forwarding companies it works with. Spokesman Joost van Doesburg said the Dutch Airline Pilots Association had received a request from KLM to add an extra pilot to all flights traveling to Asia, as they will have to re-route beginning on Saturday.  If Russia follows through on the ban, hours of travel time will be added to Asian flights.   It s only a threat but you have to prepare,  Van Doesburg said.  Russia does this sometimes when it feels countries aren t giving appropriate attention to a complaint.      De Telegraaf newspaper reported that around 15 percent of KLM s flights would be affected. A KLM spokeswoman said the airline would respond later. Airport Coordination Netherlands, the organization which allocates slots at Schiphol, said AirBridgeCargo s slots had been cut for failure to fully utilize its existing slots, according to European rules, and it did not have the power to grant any additional slots because of a cap imposed at the airport.

Italy's Berlusconi probed over deadly 1993 mafia bombings: source,"FLORENCE, Italy (Reuters) - Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is under investigation as part of an investigation into mafia bombings in 1993, a judicial source said on Tuesday, confirming newspaper reports. A mob boss jailed for the deadly attacks in Rome, Milan and Florence was recorded talking to his cellmate about the four-times premier, prompting a judge in Florence to reopen a shelved probe into Berlusconi s alleged involvement, the Italian newspapers Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica reported.  Berlusconi s lawyer Nicolo Ghedini said a previous investigation had shown his client was not involved in the bombings, which killed 10 people. Ghedini said the case had re-emerged for political reasons ahead of an important regional ballot in Sicily on Sunday and a national election due by next May.  Even speculating that (Berlusconi) could have been in any way involved in the events in question is so absurd as to make any comment unnecessary,  Ghedini said in a statement.  (It is) obvious that the umpteenth investigation can only end in a swift dismissal, as happened in the past.  A previous probe into the 81-year-old media mogul s alleged involvement in the case was shelved in 2011. Berlusconi was due to visit Sicily later on Tuesday to campaign for his Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party ahead of Sunday s regional election. Judges investigating the mafia case, which is raking over arguably the murkiest years in modern Italian history, heard fragmented recordings of conversations mob leader Giuseppe Graviano had last April in jail, the newspapers reported.   1992 he already wanted to get involved (in politics) ... and he wanted everything,  Graviano was reportedly recorded saying, referring to  Berlusca  - a common nickname for Berlusconi.   Berlusca ... asked me this favor ... I was convinced Berlusconi would win the election ... in Sicily ... he wanted to get involved ... but at that time the old guys were around ... he told me we needed a really good thing.  The mafia bombing campaign on mainland Italy stunned the country and helped lead to the collapse of the old political parties, which were riddled with corruption. Berlusconi entered politics in early 1994 and immediately won a national election. Forza Italia said in a statement that 1,296 mafiosi had been arrested during Berlusconi s years in office between 2001-05 and 2008-2011, including 32 of Italy s most wanted mobsters.  It said Berlusconi s administration had toughened prison conditions for mobsters and had seized 25 billion euros ($29.09 billion) of mafia property in its last three years in office.

Iraqi authorities gain first foothold at Kurdish frontier with Turkey,"ANKARA/BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi troops deployed on Tuesday at one of the main land crossings with Turkey, gaining a foothold at the Kurdish-held frontier for the first time in decades and imposing one of Baghdad s central demands on the Kurds. Iraq s entire land border with Turkey is located inside the Kurdish autonomous region, and has been controlled by the Kurds since before the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. But since the Kurds staged a referendum on independence last month that Baghdad considers illegal, the central government has demanded a presence at all border crossing points. The Iraqis set up positions between the Turkish and the Iraqi Kurdish checkpoints at the Habur border crossing between the Turkish town of Silopi and the Iraqi town of Zakho, a security source in Baghdad said. Vehicles crossing the border would now be subject to three checks   by Turks, Iraqi forces and the Kurds.  Habur border gate has been handed over to the central (Iraqi) government as of this morning,  Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told members of his ruling AK Party in parliament in Ankara. Officials from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said they had not relinquished control of the crossing. Discussions were ongoing to allow Iraqi  oversight  at the border, Hoshyar Zebari, a former Iraqi foreign minister now working as an adviser to the KRG, told Reuters. An Iraqi official showed Reuters pictures of the Iraqi flag being raised at the border gate, where Iraqi and Turkish soldiers were deployed and Turkish flags also hoisted. Control of the border region is of crucial importance for the landlocked Kurdish region. An oil pipeline runs from northern Iraq into Turkey, carrying crude exports which are the principal source of funds for the Kurds.  The balance of power between Iraqi central government forces and the autonomous Kurdish region has been transformed since the Kurds staged their referendum on Sept. 25. Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi ordered his forces to recapture all territory held by the Kurds outside the borders of their autonomous region, and most of it was seized this month within a matter of days. Baghdad is also demanding control of all border crossings with Turkey and Iran. Abadi has won backing from both Tehran and Ankara for his moves against the Kurds. However, in a move to help defuse tensions with the Kurds, he said on Tuesday Baghdad would start paying  soon  the salaries of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and civil servants working for the KRG. The semi-autonomous KRG has been struggling to pay the Peshmerga and its employees since 2014, after Baghdad stopped payments to it because of a dispute about oil-sharing revenue. The cost of a three-year war on Islamic State added to the Kurdistan region s financial difficulties, and fall of the oil region of Kirkuk to Iraqi forces halved the KRG s oil income. The Peshmerga took over the multi-ethnic region of Kirkuk in 2014, after the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State, preventing the militants from controlling its oilfields. Iraq s military said a delegation headed by army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Othman al-Ghanmi was visiting the area, to take control of Kurdish-held international border checkpoints with both Turkey and Syria Zebari, the Kurdish government adviser, said the Kurds were prepared to accept  Iraqis at the airports and border posts to have oversight, to make sure everyone is in compliance , but any such presence must be achieved through negotiations, not force. The split between the Kurds and the Iraqi central government is a particular challenge for Washington, which is closely allied to both sides. The United States had urged the Kurds not to hold the referendum, worried it would precipitate a backlash. The referendum and ensuing dispute with Baghdad has also exposed deep rifts within the Kurdish leadership. Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani announced on Sunday he would step down, and accused security forces loyal to a rival political party of  high treason  for yielding territory to the central government without a fight.  The KRG and the central government held talks from Friday till Sunday to resolve their conflict. Yildirim said Turkey had agreed to open another border gate with Iraq as part of a route that would lead to the city of Tal Afar, some 40 km (25 miles) west of Mosul and home to a predominantly ethnic Turkmen population. Iran will reopen all its border crossings with Iraq s Kurdistan region in the coming days, lifting restrictions imposed after last month s Kurdish vote in favor of independence, its chief of staff Major General Mohammad Baqeri said on Monday.

"Iraq to pay Kurdish Peshmerga, civil servants, says PM","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Iraqi government plans to soon start paying the salaries of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and civil servants working for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Tuesday. The semi-autonomous KRG has been struggling to pay the Peshmerga and its employees since 2014, after Baghdad stopped payments to it because of a dispute about oil-sharing revenue.   We will soon be able to pay all the salaries of the Peshmerga and the employees of the region,  Abadi told reporters  The cost of a three-year war on Islamic State added to the Kurdistan region s financial difficulties, and Iraqi troops captured the oil region of Kirkuk from the Peshmerga two weeks ago, halving the KRG s oil income.  Paying Kurdish salaries would help defuse tensions in the northern Iraqi region, where a referendum vote in favor of Kurdish independence in September triggered economic and military retaliation from the Iraqi government.

Exclusive: Kenyan Supreme Court judges denied extra security after shooting - source,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s government denied a request by Supreme Court judges for extra security after one of their bodyguards was shot, preventing them from holding a hearing that could have delayed last week s presidential election, a senior judicial source said on Tuesday. The court has been center stage since it annulled an Aug. 8 vote won by President Uhuru Kenyatta, citing procedural irregularities and ordering a repeat vote within 60 days. The decision was the first of its kind in Africa, where governments often hold sway over judges. It angered some of Kenyatta s supporters, who said the judges had thwarted the will of the people. Kenyatta won 98 percent of the vote in the Oct. 26 re-run after opposition leader Raila Odinga boycotted it on the grounds it would not be fair because the election board had failed to implement reforms he sought after the court decision. The Supreme Court had been due to meet on Oct. 25 to deliberate on an eleventh-hour request to delay the re-run. But the day before, the bodyguard of its deputy chief justice was shot as he bought pot plants beside a highway. Only Chief Justice David Maraga turned up for the Oct. 25 hearing. Without a minimum quorum of five judges, Maraga said the court could not make a ruling on the petition, paving the way for the election re-run to go ahead. Asked about the request by the judges, Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said security for all judges was enhanced in the wake of the shooting.  If anybody is telling you to the contrary, they are not telling the truth,  he told Reuters. The government said the bodyguard s shooting was a robbery rather than an attempt to intimidate the judges, whom Kenyatta had branded as  crooks  after they voided the August election. Treating the shooting as a regular crime angered the judges, who demanded they get extra security, the judicial source said.  In Kenya, ordinary criminals don t attack government vehicles driven by armed government agents who know how to shoot,  the source said. The justices demanded that their security should be publicly guaranteed given the tensions over the election or else they would refuse to attend hearings, the source said. At least 55 people have died in political violence since the August vote. The European Union monitoring mission raised the issue of intimidation after the Supreme Court hearing failed to go ahead on Oct. 25, saying it was vital that judges be allowed to work  in freedom and safety .  The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing and has raised serious questions among Kenyan stakeholders, including about possible political interference,  it said in a statement that day.

"Taliban increases influence, territory in Afghanistan: U.S. watchdog","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Taliban has increased the amount of territory it has influence over or controls in Afghanistan in the past six months, a U.S. watchdog agency reported on Tuesday, as the militant group has stepped up attacks in recent weeks. As of August, 13 percent of the 407 districts in Afghanistan were under Taliban control or influence, compared with 11 percent in February, according to a report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR. That means an additional 700,000 people now live in districts where the Taliban has at least some influence. The updated figures are a sign of the deteriorating security situation in the war-torn country, even as the United States has committed several thousand more troops. The gains being made by the Taliban and a spate of recent attacks underscore worries about Afghan security forces  ability to deal with a relentless insurgency that they have struggled to contain since most foreign troops left at the end of 2014. In total, about 43 percent of Afghanistan s districts are either under Taliban control or being contested, three percent higher than six months ago, SIGAR said. U.S. forces in Afghanistan also withheld certain data on the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, the report said, including  casualties, personnel strength, attrition, and the operational readiness of equipment.   In a significant development this quarter, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) classified or otherwise restricted information SIGAR has until now publicly reported,  the report said. Afghanistan s worsening security situation was highlighted on Tuesday when a suicide bomber in the capital killed as many as eight people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. The increase in the campaign of U.S. air strikes in recent months is part of a new strategy aimed at reversing Taliban gains and forcing the insurgents to seek peace talks with the Afghan government. The SIGAR report, citing the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, also said there had been a 52 percent increase in civilian casualties from coalition and Afghan air strikes in the first nine months of 2017 compared with the same period in 2016. There had also been a sharp increase in  insider attacks  by militants, targeting U.S. and Afghan forces. In June, three Americans were killed an one wounded when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

Seven killed as Israel destroys tunnel dug under Gaza border,"GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Seven Palestinian militants were killed on Monday when Israel blew up what it said was a tunnel being dug underneath the Gaza Strip border. Hamas said Israel had made a  futile attempt to sabotage efforts to repair Palestinian unity , a reference to the  reconciliation agreement it reached with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, earlier this month.    However, neither Israel nor Hamas seemed eager to seek escalation. Israel was at pains to point out that its action against the tunnel was carried out on its own side of the border.  The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) does not intend to escalate the situation but stands prepared for a variety of scenarios,  said Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman.  The working assumption is that this is not the only tunnel that Palestinian terrorist organizations are trying to dig.  The tunnel was being dug from the Gaza town of Khan Younis across the border, where it was blown up, Conricus said. A source for the Islamic Jihad militant group said the head of the faction s armed wing in central Gaza was killed along with a senior associate and other gunmen. It vowed revenge saying  all options are open for response.  Hamas s armed wing said two of its gunmen were killed while trying to rescue the Islamic Jihad men working in the tunnel. Gaza health officials said nine people were wounded. It said it would avenge  the blood of the martyrs.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in remarks to legislators of his right-wing Likud party, said  groundbreaking technology  aided the tunnel s discovery, but gave no details. Israel has been constructing a sensor-equipped underground wall along the 60-km (36-mile) Gaza border, aiming to complete the $1.1 billion project by mid-2019. During the last Gaza war, in 2014, Hamas fighters used dozens of tunnels to blindside Israel s superior forces and threaten civilian communities near the frontier, a counterpoint to the Iron Dome anti-missile system that largely protected the country s heartland from militant rocket barrages. Israel and the United States have called for Hamas to be disarmed as part of the pact between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, so Israeli peace efforts with Abbas, which collapsed in 2014, could proceed. Hamas has rejected the demand. On Saturday, UNRWA, the main U.N. welfare agency for Palestinians, said it had discovered  what appeared to be a tunnel  underneath one of its schools in Gaza on Oct. 15 and had sealed the cavity. U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt tweeted on Monday:  Hamas uses the world s generosity to shield terror. Palestinians in Gaza deserve so much better.  ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1

Kremlin says Russia not accused in U.S. case against ex-Trump aides,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday that U.S. charges against President Donald Trump s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide showed Moscow had been unfairly maligned in accusations that it meddled in last year s U.S. presidential election. Federal investigators probing alleged Russian interference in the election, something Moscow denies, charged Manafort and Rick Gates with money laundering on Monday. But despite being brought as part of a five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides, the charges, some going back over a decade, centered on Manafort s work for Ukraine s former government, not Russia s. That was welcomed in Russia, where officials are watching the investigation closely since public evidence of Russian meddling, something that has not so far been presented, would be sure to translate into tougher U.S. sanctions against Moscow. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted the absence of allegations against Russia in the indictment against Manafort and Gates, saying on Tuesday that Moscow had always said it had never interfered in the U.S. election. That assertion is challenged by U.S. intelligence agencies  who say unequivocally that Moscow did interfere in the November 2016 vote.  ...Russia does not feature in the charges that were leveled in any way. Other countries and other people feature (in the charges),  Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  Moscow never felt itself guilty so it doesn t feel  exonerated now,  he said, when asked whether the Kremlin interpreted the indictment as proof that its repeated denials about meddling election were true. Peskov also brushed aside any suggestion that someone with links to the Russian Foreign Ministry might have tried to set up a meeting with the Trump campaign through a third ex-aide, George Papadopoulos, who it was announced on Monday pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI.  Russia s flagship TV news show took a similar line on Monday evening, saying it was  now clear that there was nothing  to allegations about Manafort being in touch with Russian officials to try to sway the election.     The U.S. investigation was an internal matter for the United States, said Peskov, but Moscow was following it with interest. Peskov laughed off the purported role of Papadopoulos, who told investigators he had tried to set up a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Russian leadership. In his unsuccessful quest to broker such a meeting, Papadopoulos said he had met a London-based professor boasting of contacts with Russian officials and an unnamed Russian woman. He also mentioned being in touch with someone linked to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Peskov, when asked what the Kremlin made of someone linked to the Foreign Ministry allegedly trying to set up a Putin-Trump meeting, said:  It s an absolutely laughable allegation.  Media reports have suggested the individual linked to the ministry is Ivan Timofeev, who works for a Moscow-based think-tank called the Russian International Relations Council (RIAC).  Timofeev did not respond to a request for comment, but told the gazeta.ru online news portal in August that Papadopoulos had emailed him in the spring of 2016 and spoken about the possibility of organizing a Trump trip to Russia. Timofeev said Papadopoulos had never made a formal request to either RIAC or the Russian Foreign Ministry for such a visit, however, and that he had got the impression that he had been  acting on his own initiative  and was  an enthusiast with little experience.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday that there was nothing  illegal  about Papadopoulos contacting someone at RIAC. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
"Colombia authorizes air raids against dissident FARC, crime gangs","BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia s armed forces have been authorized to launch air raids against crime gangs and FARC members who have refused to adhere to a peace accord with the former guerilla group and instead chose to continue drug trafficking and other criminal activity, the Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. As many as 1,000 members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have not abided by the terms of last year s peace agreement with the government, preferring instead to remain armed, fight the government and profit from illegal drugs and mining. The conflict killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions since it began in 1964. The executive order allows troops to conduct bomb attacks against FARC dissidents and crime gangs from airplanes and helicopters, and shields the military from criminal prosecution, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. Raids can only be carried out if civilians are not close by. Air raids were the most effective weapon in the government s fight against the FARC, pushing fighters deep into inhospitable jungle and killing high-level rebel commanders. That strategy also has been used against the National Liberation Army (ELN), now the biggest active guerrilla group in Colombia, which is  in peace talks with the government. The two sides began a bilateral ceasefire in October. More than 11,300 members of the FARC, including fighters, urban militia and prisoners are in the process of being incorporated into society after the group handed in its weapons to the United Nations and formed a political party.

"Assad sets sights on Kurdish areas, risking new Syria conflict","BEIRUT (Reuters) - With Islamic State near defeat in Syria, Damascus is setting its sights on territory held by Kurdish-led forces including eastern  oil fields, risking a new confrontation that could draw the United States in more deeply and complicate Russian diplomacy. President Bashar al-Assad and his Iranian allies appear to have been emboldened by events in Iraq, where Kurdish authorities have suffered a major blow since regional states mobilised against their independence referendum, analysts say. Rivalry between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), supported by the United States, and the Syrian government backed by Iran and Russia is emerging as a fault line with their common enemy - Islamic State - close to collapse in Syria. Syria s main Kurdish groups hope for a new phase of negotiations that will shore up their autonomy in northern Syria. Assad s government, however, is asserting its claim to areas captured by the SDF from the jihadist group, known in Arabic by its enemies as Daesh, in more forceful terms.  On Sunday, Damascus declared Islamic State s former capital at Raqqa would be considered  occupied  until the Syrian army took control - a challenge to Washington which helped the SDF capture the city in months of fighting. And the eastern oil fields seized by the SDF in October, including Syria s largest, will be a target for the government as it tries to recover resources needed for reconstructing areas it controls, according to a Syrian official and a non-Syrian commander in the alliance fighting in support of Assad.  The message is very clear to the SDF militants and their backers in the coalition, headed by America: the lands they took from Daesh are rightfully the Syrian state s,  said the non-Syrian commander, who requested that his name and nationality be withheld.    Regarding the resources of the Syrian people in the east - oil and so on - we will not allow anyone to continue to control the country s resources and to create cantons or to think about self government,  added the commander, who is part of a military alliance that includes numerous Iran-backed Shi ite militias from across the region. The Syrian official said the SDF could not keep control of oil resources.  We won t permit it,  said the official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity as he was giving a personal view.     The United States has not spelt out how military support for the SDF will evolve after Islamic State s defeat, a sensitive point due to the concerns of its NATO ally Turkey. Ankara regards Syrian Kurdish power as a threat its national security as its forces are fighting Kurdish PKK rebels over the border in Turkey.  The U.S.-led coalition, which has established several military bases in northern Syria, has been helping the SDF shore up control of the recently captured al-Omar oil field in Deir al-Zor province.      Many people will say that will help them with (political) negotiations, but only if the United States remains with them, otherwise they are going to get clobbered,  said Joshua Landis, an expert on Syria and head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.   I think the Syrian government is going to push on some of these oil wells, in the same way as Iraq just pushed to get Kirkuk oil, and in the same way the Iraqi push is going to embolden the Syrian army,  he said.     Iraqi Kurds took control of large areas outside their autonomous region during the fight against Islamic State. However, last month s independence referendum prompted Western opposition and fierce resistance from Baghdad, Ankara and Assad s Iranian allies, and the Kurdish authorities have since lost much territory to Baghdad, including oil producing areas around the city of Kirkuk.  The Syrian official said this should serve  as a lesson for the Kurds in Syria, so they think about the future . Regional sources say the U.S. unwillingness to stop Iraqi government forces, backed by Shi ite militias, from recapturing Kirkuk sent an encouraging message to Assad and his Iranian allies to retake the SDF-held oil areas in Syria. With critical military support from Russia and the Iran-backed militias, Assad has recovered swathes of central and eastern Syria from Islamic State this year, having defeated many anti-Assad rebel factions in western Syria. The Kurdish YPG militia, the dominant force in the SDF, controls the second largest chunk of Syrian territory - around a quarter of the country. Syrian Kurdish leaders say they are not seeking secession.  The YPG and Damascus have mostly avoided conflict during the Syrian civil war, setting aside historic enmity to fight shared foes. Kurdish-led regions of northern Syria have meanwhile focused on establishing an autonomous government which they aim to safeguard. Moscow has called for a new  congress  of Syrian groups that may start work on a new constitution. The Russian Foreign Ministry published on Tuesday a list of 33 groups and political parties invited to a meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Nov. 18. A Syrian Kurdish official told Reuters the administration in northern Syria had been invited to the congress. Kurdish officials said they discussed their political demands with the Russians as recently as last month. A senior Kurdish politician said government statements directed at the Kurdish-led regions of northern Syria were contradictory, noting that the Syrian foreign minister had said in September that Kurdish autonomy demands were negotiable.  One day they say we are willing to negotiate and then someone else denies this or puts out an opposing statement,   Fawza Youssef said in a telephone interview with Reuters.  One of them declares war and the other wants to come negotiate. What is the regime s strategy? Dialogue or war?  After the final defeat of Islamic State in Deir al-Zor,  the situation will drive all the political sides and the combatants to start the stage of negotiations , Youssef said. The SDF has also pushed into Arab majority areas, including Raqqa and parts of Deir al-Zor, where it is working to establish its model of multi-ethnic local governance. Analysts believe the Syrian Kurdish groups could use the SDF-held Arab areas as bargaining chips in negotiations with Damascus.  There is no other option than to negotiate,  Youssef said.  Either a new stage of tensions and attrition will start - which we are 100 percent against - or a stage of dialogue and negotiations will start.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
"As France emergency rule ends, Macron defends new anti-terrorism law","STRASBOURG/PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron defended new security legislation on Tuesday, saying Islamist militants still posed a serious threat to France as a two-year state of emergency comes to an end. The anti-terrorism law, which critics say undermines civil liberties, takes effect on Wednesday, replacing the state of emergency that was imposed in November 2015, when militants killed 130 people in coordinated attacks across Paris. The law gives the police greater powers to search properties, conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut down mosques suspected of preaching hatred than they had prior to the state of emergency. Speaking to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, eastern France, Macron said  jihadist terrorism  remained the biggest security threat to France.  Terrorism targets European society and values just as it targets government and state. We are being attacked because of what we stand for,  said Macron, who took office in May.  More than 240 people have been killed on French soil in Islamist-inspired attacks in almost three years. Dozens more have been killed in similar attacks elsewhere in Europe, primarily in Britain and Belgium. The government says the state of emergency has helped intelligence agencies to thwart more than 30 attacks. Many of those emergency powers will now be enshrined in law, drawing criticism from human rights groups.  France has become so addicted to the state of emergency that it is now injecting several of these abusive measures into ordinary law,  Human Rights Watch said before parliament backed the legislation. Macron said the new legislation would be reviewed and adapted as needed two years from now.  We re fighting terrorism with determination and we will continue to do so within the bounds of the law and with the oversight of judges,  Macron said.     ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
Twelve killed in Mexico violence between suspected fuel thieves,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Twelve people were killed in shootings in the central Mexican state of Puebla in violence linked to warring gangs of fuel thieves, the state attorney general s office said on Tuesday, adding to a mounting death toll from the lucrative trade. Illegal fuel taps and gasoline thefts cost Mexico hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Fighting between the fuel thieves, known as huachicoleros, has this year helped push violence in Mexico to its highest levels since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office at the end of 2012. Authorities found the bodies of four men and a woman in the state capital, also named Puebla, after they were attacked by unidentified gunmen, state prosecutors said in a statement. The bodies of two men were also found in the municipality of Amozoc de Mota just east of the capital, prosecutors said. In addition, five others were killed in a shootout between suspected fuel thieves in Tlaltenango on the northwestern fringe of the city of Puebla, state prosecutors said. All twelve deaths are believed to be the product of disputes between gangs of fuel thieves, and all occurred on Monday, a spokesman for the attorney general s office said.

South Africa's Zuma asks court to set aside report on influence-peddling,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday asked the High Court to set aside a report by the anti-corruption watchdog on alleged influence-peddling in his government, saying he would instead set up a commission of inquiry into the allegations. The court has been hearing a case brought by Zuma who had challenged the right of the report s author, South Africa s anti-graft agency known as Public Protector, to call for a judicial inquiry to investigate the allegations.  Zuma, 75, who previously described the  State of Capture  report as  unfair  in parliament, said setting up such an inquiry was his prerogative. The report published a year ago recommended a judicial investigation into allegations of systemic corruption by Zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies. The report focused on allegations that Zuma s friends, the businessmen and brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. Zuma and the Guptas have denied the accusations. In a fresh application on Tuesday, Zuma s lawyers argued that the entire report by former Public Protector head Thuli Madonsela should be set aside.  Should the court grant his application, Zuma would set up a separate commission of inquiry himself within 30 days of the date of the order, court papers presented by his lawyers said. The main opposition Democratic Alliance party opposes Zuma s application, saying it is unconstitutional. It says it wants the court to support Madonsela s recommendation for a judicial inquiry.

Czech election winner Babis to seek minority government,"LANY, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Czech election winner Andrej Babis will attempt to form a minority government after being shunned by other parties, Babis said on Tuesday after meeting the president. The country faces the possibility of months of political wrangling which could put approval of the 2018 budget approval at risk, potentially curbing investments that would help the economy keep growing at least at its current rapid pace. Babis said he hoped to have a new government put together by the Christmas holiday. His ANO party won a parliamentary election this month by a large margin, convincing voters it could deliver a more effective state, weed out corruption and distribute the fruits of economic expansion more fairly. Other parties have refused to back a government that includes billionaire businessman Babis, who is facing fraud charges regarding a 2 million euro EU subsidy. Babis denies any wrongdoing, calling the charges politically motivated. After meeting President Milos Zeman, Babis said he was  very sorry  the other parties had not given ANO a chance in coalition talks.  We will try to form a minority government and will try to convince lawmakers ... of other parties with our programme,  he told a news conference alongside Zeman. Zeman said he would give Babis a second attempt if his first try fails a confidence vote in the lower house. Forming a minority government would require support from other parties as ANO s 78 seats do not make up a majority in the 200-member lower chamber.  Only the Communists have said they could tolerate a minority government. Babis can be appointed prime minister only after Nov. 20, when the newly elected lower chamber of parliament opens its session. It has to elect a speaker before current Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka can vacate the position for his successor. This process could take long as some parties may try to prevent Babis  appointment by blocking the speaker s election.   In 2013, Zeman rejected a majority coalition in parliament after a centre-right cabinet had collapsed, and appointed Jiri Rusnok, the current Governor of the Czech National Bank, as prime minister. His government ruled for half a year without winning a confidence vote. Babis dismissed a suggestion by the head of the conservative TOP 09 party to block the speaker as  destructive and reckless .   The worst thing which could happen is that we would have a blocked parliament and a provisional budget,  he said. If a budget is not approved by the end of the year, a provisional arrangement kicks in, meaning the state would run with the previous year s budget, imposing severe limits on investments and other non-mandatory spending. Czech markets have taken the political uncertainty in their stride, with the crown trading near multi-year highs as the central bank looks set to continue raising interest rates this week. The country of 10.6 million has a history of shaky coalition governments. The outgoing centre-left coalition, led by the Social Democrats and including ANO, is the first in 15 years to finish its four-year term. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
Iran says no need to increase missile range as can already hit U.S. forces,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran has no need to increase the range of its ballistic missiles as they could already reach U.S. forces stationed in the region, the head of the Revolutionary Guards said on Tuesday. As U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to impose new sanctions against Iran s missile program, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari said  sanctions would only increase number of Iranian missiles, and their precision . Trump this month refused to certify Tehran s compliance with a deal struck with world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions. The House of Representatives voted last week for new sanctions on Iran s ballistic missile program and Trump has urged U.S. allies to join Washington in taking strong action to curb  Iran s continued dangerous and destabilizing behavior , including sanctions targeting its missile development.  Our missiles  range is 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles), and that can be increased, but we believe this range is enough for the Islamic Republic as most of the U.S. forces and most of their interests in the region are within this range,  Jafari was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.  Americans are trying to impose new sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards for its missile program, but that is an excuse to harm Iran s economy,  Jafari said. Iran has one of the Middle East s largest missile programs and some of its precision-guided missiles have the range to strike Israel. The United States says Iran s missile program is a breach of international law because the missiles could carry nuclear warheads in the future.  Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its nuclear program is for civilian uses only. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
Lebanese army gets two A-29 light-attack aircraft from U.S.,"HAMAT, Lebanon (Reuters) - The United States delivered two A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft to Lebanon s army on Tuesday, a sign of continued U.S. support despite Israeli accusations that the Lebanese military is controlled by Hezbollah.  The planes will be used as armed observation aircraft, a security source in Lebanon said, and represent a big upgrade for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF).  Earlier this month, U.S. ally Israel said Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shi ite Muslim movement, had gained control over Lebanon s conventional military, a charge the Lebanese army denies. Hezbollah, which was designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department in 1997, last fought Israel in a war in 2006. Lebanon is formally in a state of war with Israel.    The significant increase in LAF combat capability that this aircraft represents will ensure that the LAF will remain a national unifying force, a bulwark against extremism and terrorism,  said U.S. Ambassador Elizabeth Richard. The Islamic State militant group held a pocket of land straddling Lebanon s border with Syria until August.  Over the last decade, the U.S. government has invested over $1.5 billion in training and equipment, and has trained over 32,000 Lebanese troops, Richard said.  We have recently announced another $120 million in foreign military financing, which brings the total investment in the LAF to over $160 million just this year,  she said. The United States will deliver another four Super Tucanos to Lebanon.  The two new aircraft - which have advanced combat and surveillance capabilities - will  make a qualitative leap in improving the aerial capabilities of the LAF,  said Lebanese Army Commander General Joseph Aoun.

Trump has 'warm rapport' with Philippines' Duterte: official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has developed a friendly relationship with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a senior administration official said on Tuesday, despite Duterte s often profanity-laden tirades against the United States.  I think there s a warm rapport there and he s very much  looking forward to his first in-person meeting with President Duterte,  the U.S. official told reporters during a background briefing on Trump s Nov. 3-14 trip to Asia. The two leaders have become friendly during telephone conversations and exchanges of letters, the official said. Trump will travel to Asia amid rising tensions over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs. He will be in Manila on the last leg of his trip, which includes visits to Japan, South Korea, China, and Vietnam, to attend the ASEAN leaders  summit. Duterte has attacked the United States verbally, chiding Washington for treating the Philippines  like a dog,  despite the two nations  longstanding relationship. The Philippines  leader announced his  separation  from the United States during a visit to Beijing a year ago, declaring he had realigned with China as the two agreed to resolve a South China Sea dispute through talks. Duterte is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the Philippines, which his government denies. The Philippine leader was infuriated by expressions of concern by members of former President Barack Obama s administration about extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. But Trump, in a phone call to Duterte in May, praised the Philippine leader for doing an  unbelievable job on the drug problem  despite human rights groups  condemnation of Duterte s drug crackdown, in which thousands of people have been killed.

U.S. sees China in 'retrenchment' on move toward market economy: U.S. official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States believes progress with China on a range of trade issues has become more difficult and Beijing appears on a  trajectory of retrenchment,  a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday. President Donald Trump will insist in upcoming talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping that more balance is needed in U.S.-Chinese trade relations, the official said, briefing reporters ahead of Trump s Nov. 3-14 Asia trip that will include a stop in Beijing. Trump s Asia tour is shaping up to be the longest by an American president in 25 years. With tensions aboil over North Korea s nuclear challenge, Trump leaves on Friday on a trip with stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. While in South Korea, Trump will speak to U.S. and South Korea troops, but time constraints will preclude a stop at the demilitarized zone, the border region that separates North and South Korea, another senior official said. The official s remarks on the U.S.-Chinese trade relations could herald some friction in Trump s talks with Xi on a state visit to Beijing that comes just as Xi consolidated power in a Communist Party congress. Trump has repeatedly complained about the U.S. trade deficit with China, which was $347 billion in 2016. But he has shied away from taking major punitive trade actions against China. The official said over the long-term China must provide fair and reciprocal treatment to U.S. and international companies and stop  predatory trade and investment practice.   Progress on a range of bilateral economic issues has become increasingly difficult. We believe this reflects a slowdown and even a retrenchment in China s move toward a market-oriented economy,  the official said. On Monday, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai predicted in a briefing with reporters that  there will be significant outcomes on the economic side  while Trump is in Beijing. Cui said countries cannot look simply at trade balance and imbalance because what is behind those numbers is important and  very complicated.  He called the U.S. trade deficit a  structural problem  that cannot be resolved overnight. While on his trip Trump will also hold his first face-to-face meeting with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of the Association of South East Asia Nations summit being held in Manila. Despite a history of anti-American rhetoric, one of the administration officials said Trump and Duterte have developed a  warm rapport.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

Shelling hits besieged Syrian Ghouta school gate after aid delivery,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Shelling killed around ten people, including five children at a school gate, in a besieged rebel enclave near Syria s capital Damascus on Tuesday, a day after a U.N. aid delivery to the area, a war monitor said. The shelling also injured 30 other people in the Eastern Ghouta area, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.  The Britain-based monitor said the ongoing shelling which began Tuesday morning hit the towns of Jisreen, Douma, Saqba, Mesraba, Harasta, Ain Terma, Hazza and Kafr Batna.  On Monday a United Nations and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) convoy delivered aid to the towns of Kafr Batna and Saqba.     A tightening siege by government forces has pushed people to the verge of famine in the eastern suburbs, residents and aid workers said last week, bringing desperation to the only major rebel enclave near the Syrian capital.  Syrian state television on Tuesday said shells had also hit parts of government-held Damascus, injuring at least five people.      In July, Moscow and rebels in Eastern Ghouta signed a deal to make the area a  de-escalation zone . The agreement raised hopes of open crossings and aid flows.     The aid organisation International Rescue Committee said on Monday the de-escalation zone agreements with rebel areas across Syria were failing to protect civilians.   The safety of civilians has not improved with the establishment of these so-called de-escalation areas. With so many armed groups not covered by ceasefire agreements, we have even seen periods of increased aerial bombardment,  IRC s Middle East Director of Public Affairs Tom Garofalo said.

Kenyan opposition leader calls for petitions against vote won by Kenyatta,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday called for pickets and petitions against an election he boycotted last week won by President Uhuru Kenyatta but stopped short of appealing for mass protests or announcing a court challenge to the result. Odinga pulled out of the vote saying it would be unfair because the election board had failed to implement reforms after the Supreme Court cited procedural irregularities and annulled an Aug. 8 vote that had been won by Kenyatta. Odinga said the Oct. 26 result would not stand but did not announce measures likely to overturn it or force the government to negotiate. He said his opposition coalition would form a people s assembly to study issues of governance and issue recommendations to county assemblies.   The resistance movement shall be responsible for implementing a vigorous positive political action program that includes economic boycotts, peaceful processions, picketing and other legitimate protests,  he said.  This election must not stand .... It will make a complete mockery of elections and might well be the end of the ballot as a means of instituting government in Kenya. It will completely destroy public confidence in the vote,  he said. The ruling party controls a majority in both houses of parliament and most of the 47 county governorships, making it difficult for the opposition to implement its proposals. Odinga s proposals left many of his supporters confused.   I don t understand what he wants,  said Felix Wanga, a 25-year-old waiter who listened to the speech in Kisumu, the western city that forms the bedrock of Odinga s support.   I will have to wait until tomorrow to hear from our local leaders.   On Monday, Kenyatta was declared the winner of the repeat presidential election with 98 percent of the vote, handing him a second five-year term at the helm of the region s richest economy.  In a sign of the tensions raised by the election, Odinga s speech was delayed when the media walked out en masse after his supporters assaulted two journalists, whom they accused of bias. Odinga apologized for the incident.  The election crisis had blunted growth in Kenya, a trade and diplomatic hub for east Africa and a headquarters for multinational companies because of its relatively free market, pro-Western diplomacy and stability. The extended electoral season sparked clashes between Odinga s protesters and police, and in recent days fanned an undercurrent of ethnic tensions that frequently surfaces during Kenyan elections. Reuters journalists confirmed two people were killed in ethnic clashes.  Around 50 people died in political violence after the Aug. 8 elections, and another 14 people since Thursday s vote, according to diplomatic sources. A provisional government tally said nine people had been killed since Thursday. Political violence has shaken the nation before, when around 1,200 people were killed after political protests sparked ethnic clashes a decade ago.  Diplomats and civil society leaders have publicly urged the two leaders to meet and engage in post-election  national dialogue . In his acceptance speech, Kenyatta ruled out the possibility of dialogue with Odinga if the opposition lodged any legal cases contesting his victory. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

But he has engaged Paul Bekaert, a veteran human rights advocate who has represented Basques, Kurds and others in the past.  I know the Spanish reaction very well. I know their psychology and their mentality,  Bekaert told Reuters at the law office where he met Puigdemont on Monday.  Spain is using the courts in Spain and in Belgium to make political statements,  he said.  You cannot use courts in Belgium or in Spain for politics. And that s the case in Spain.  Spain s constitutional court ruled that an independence referendum which Puigdemont s regional government organised on Oct. 1 was illegal. Madrid has since taken direct control of Catalonia and the public prosecutor has accused Puigdemont of rebellion and sedition, crimes carrying up to 30 years in jail.  Puigdemont was considering seeking asylum but it was not certain, Bekaert said.   We have a lot of time to decide,  he said, adding that he could also take on as clients other Catalan leaders, some of whom were with Puigdemont in Belgium.  We will see in the coming weeks what we are doing.  While Belgium has an unusual track record in refusing to extradite Europeans wanted by other EU states, the main reason Puigdemont had come was to address a wider audience for Catalonia s grievances against Madrid, the lawyer said.  He comes to Belgium first of all because it is the capital of Europe. He is here completely legally. He has the right to come here. He is not hiding,  he said.  Bekaert said he was not acting out of political sympathy for the Catalan cause. Puigdemont sought him out in the small town of Tielt in western Flanders for of his 40 years of experience in human rights law, not for any connection to the Flemish separatist movement which gives Belgium a particular interest in Spain s struggles with Basque and Catalan separatists. Since the 1970s, he has travelled as an observer to the Basque country, Northern Ireland and the Palestinian Territories, as well as defending people seeking leave to remain in Belgium.  He said, however, that the increasing use of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), first introduced in 2004, would make it harder to block extraditions of the kind he had fought for Basques in the 1990s.  While Belgium extradited people suspected of violence and terrorist offences it rejected some cases its judges viewed as  political crimes . But the EAW, which reflects EU assumptions that all member states offer full democratic legal protections, makes the situation today different, Bekaert said.  Since the European warrant, you can make an extradition for a political crime. The exception is no more in the law.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
"German police arrest Syrian suspect, avert 'major terrorist attack'","BERLIN (Reuters) - German police arrested a 19-year-old Syrian suspected of planning an Islamist-motivated bomb attack in Germany with the aim of killing as many people as possible, the federal prosecutor s office said on Tuesday. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said security officials had averted a  major terrorist attack .  The man, identified as Yamen A., had been in contact online with jihadists including one who described himself as a  soldier of the caliphate , a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor s office said. Yamen A. was arrested in the early hours in the northeastern town of Schwerin. Police searched his home and also those of other people not suspected of being directly involved.  According to the findings so far, Yamen A. made the decision no later than July 2017 to detonate an explosive device in Germany in order to kill and injure as many people as possible,  the prosecutor s office said in a statement.  As a result, he began to procure components and chemicals needed to make an explosive device. Whether the suspect had already envisaged a specific target for his bomb attack is still unclear,  the office added. He had ordered chemicals over the internet that could be used to make the explosive TATP, short for triacetone triperoxide, the spokeswoman for the prosecutor s office later added. He had also acquired two radios, batteries and a cellphone battery, suggesting he planned a remote-controlled explosion by radio or mobile telephone. There were no indications that he was a member of a terrorist organisation, the office said. It did not say when he arrived in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is trying to form a new coalition government after elections last month, has come under fire for allowing more than one million people to enter Germany over the past two years - many of them refugees from Syria. Her  open door  refugee policy saw her conservatives bleed support in the election to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), which won seats in the national parliament for the first time. De Maiziere said the raid on the suspect took place  late enough to secure evidence and at the same time early enough to reliably ward off the danger.   The threat situation in Germany remains high. Germany, Europe, the West are in the sights of Islamist terrorism,  he added in a statement. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
Bahrain court sentences 10 men on terrorism charges,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A Bahraini court sentenced 10 men to life imprisonment and revoked their citizenship on charges of forming a terrorist cell and plotting attacks, the Bahraini Public Prosecution said on Tuesday. The men were accused of receiving training in military camps in Iran and Iraq in the use of arms and bombs to carry out terrorist attacks in Bahrain, the prosecution said in a statement. Bahrain, a small island state linked to Saudi Arabia by a 25 km (15 mile) causeway, is strategically important to the West as it hosts the U.S. Fifth Fleet. It has a Shi ite Muslim majority population but is ruled by a Sunni royal family. The government, citing years of deadly bombing and shooting attacks against its security forces, says it faces a militant threat backed by arch-foe Iran. On Monday Bahrain s Public Prosecution said it had sentenced 19 unnamed defendants to prison terms for contacts with a banned party it says is backed by Iran and involved in militant attacks. Critics accuse Bahrain of clamping down on dissent, a charge the government rejects.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
"New Cyprus talks must offer clarity to Turk Cypriots, official says","NICOSIA (Reuters) - Talks on the reunification of Cyprus should resume only if the  political status  of Turkish Cypriots is addressed should the new talks fail, a senior Turkish Cypriot official said. Outlining positions likely to be rejected outright by Greek Cypriots, Ozdil Nami, the chief Turkish Cypriot negotiator, said the Turkish Cypriots needed assurance that their political status would be spelled out if the talks failed. Cyprus was split by a Turkish invasion in 1974 that followed a Greek-inspired coup. Northern Cyprus is now a Turkish Cypriot state of about 300,000 people that is recognised only by Turkey. For Greek Cypriots, who run the island s internationally recognised government which represents the whole island in the European Union, any recognition of the north without reunification is out of the question.   We as the Turkish Cypriot side would insist that the new process, whatever it is going to be, would have to bring clarity to the status of the Turkish Cypriots in international fora,  Nami told Reuters in an interview. Asked to clarify, Nami said:  It would have to spell out what our political status be, should the Greek Cypriot side once again say  no . Either  no  to taking a deal to referendum, or going to a referendum and saying  no .  Pressed further on whether that meant Turkish Cypriots should be accorded some form of recognition if a new initiative sank because of Greek Cypriot recalcitrance, he said:  Exactly . Talks to unite Cyprus collapsed in July, ending one of the most promising negotiations to resolve the long-running conflict, which is a source of tension between Greece and Turkey and hampers Ankara s hopes of joining the EU.   Each side blamed the other for scuppering a deal that would have seen the island united under a two-zone federal system. With a slight shift of present boundaries, northern Cyprus would have become a  constituent state  of the new federal system.  This political ambiguity hovering about our heads for almost 50 years must end,  said Nami, whose office lies a short distance from the green line controlled by the United Nations that splits the Cypriot capital, Nicosia. Since 2003, several crossing points have opened along a 180-km (116 mile) ceasefire line patrolled by the UN. Thousands of people cross daily from one side to the other. Largely peaceful - apart from serious incidents in 1996 in which several people died - both sides say the status quo is not acceptable.   We need to change the status quo, it is mutually agreed,   Nami said.  We either change it by finalizing a federal settlement, or we change it some other way. In both scenarios, in a mutually agreed way.   A year after the checkpoints opened, Greek Cypriots rejected a UN reunification blueprint that critics said ran roughshod over the rights of thousands of people uprooted in the 1974 conflict. Proponents called it a realistic, workable alternative reflecting realities on the ground. Turkish Cypriots had voted in favor of the blueprint.  No one can convince the Turkish Cypriots to once again engage in negotiations that will be hostage of a Greek Cypriot  no ,  Nami said.   Nami, a former Turkish Cypriot foreign minister, said he sensed  huge fatigue  in his community and that he believed the same applied on the Greek Cypriot side.  I think in order for us to have a credible process we must be able to tell our people this process will have a specific end period, at the end of which, a decision will be taken,  he said.  Otherwise it will be extremely difficult to have the public support necessary behind the process.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
Iran seen as winner after Iraq's Kurds lose referendum gamble,"ERBIL (Reuters) - There are no winners among Iraq s Kurds, just weeks after Kurdish president Masoud Barzani gambled away his people s autonomy in a defiant independence referendum.   The losing bet has come at a steep price for everyone involved.  Barzani has had to give up the presidency, his Kurdish political foes have angered their popular base, and the Kurdish people, who overwhelmingly voted to break away from Iraq, feel further than ever from their lifelong dream of independence.    The ultimate winner, analysts say, is Iran, widely believed to have backed and orchestrated Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in his Oct. 16 offensive to recapture Kurdish held-areas, including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.   The Iranians outwitted the Americans; they were the driving force behind the deal to hand over Kirkuk,  said Hassan Shaaban, a political commentator and rights activist in Baghdad.   The balance of power has been transformed in the north of Iraq, exposing the limited hand the Kurds have to play in future negotiations. It has also exposed the dominant role Iran played in transforming the fate of the Kurdish region.  Iran is poised to exploit the political aftermath, pushing to move the centre of power from the regional capital Erbil, where the Barzanis and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) have dominated, to its Kurdish allies in the city of Sulaimaniya.  Iran was always one step ahead on the referendum,  said Renad Mansour, an Iraq expert at the Chatham House think-tank. They knew Barzani was never going to postpone the vote, he said, adding:  The U.S. was left scrambling while the Iranians were plotting.  A senior Iranian official said Tehran had advised Barzani against the referendum but he would not listen.  We tried to stop this referendum because it was not in their interest. But unfortunately Mr Barzani miscalculated his social base among Kurds and went ahead with the vote,  Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran s National Security Council, was quoted as saying by Mehr news agency on Tuesday.   Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani has for years been allied to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the main rival of Barzani s KDP. But the referendum has drawn the powerful Iranian commander even closer to Kurdish politics, and shown how far Iran s reach has extended beyond the central government in Baghdad.   Ahead of the vote, Soleimani warned Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq to withdraw their forces from Kirkuk or face a  fiery  onslaught by Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed fighters, according to Kurdish and Iraqi officials.   The warning prompted Kurdish Peshmerga fighters to withdraw from most areas, and deepened the split between Barzani s power base in Erbil, and the rival Talabani clan in Sulaimaniya, long allied with Iran.  Iraqi politicians have voiced concern about the growing influence of Iran, despite praising Abadi for reining in Kurdish ambitions.   We feel worried seeing the octopus arms stretching deeper in the north,  said Ahmed Asi al-Obeidi, a Sunni tribal sheikh and a member of Kirkuk s tribal council.   We all have seen the problems Iranian meddling has caused in other parts of Iraq, including mainly Sunni areas, and if the same amount of interference is repeated in Kurdish areas, then the worst is coming and instability will prevail.   Addressing his people, demoralized by humiliating territorial defeats, Barzani said on Sunday that he would step down, just one month after the vote he championed in the face of regional and international opposition.   He accused his enemies of committing  high treason  in surrendering Kirkuk to Iraqi forces without a fight, while his rivals have directed the same accusation against him for holding the referendum in the first place.   The vote and its ensuing political and military retribution from Baghdad - backed by Iran and Turkey - demolished the position of relative strength the Kurds had enjoyed for years.   The blame has been placed on Barzani s shoulders, both by his political opponents, notably the rival Talabani clan allied to Iran, and his Western allies, who were angered by his insistence on holding the vote against their advice.   On Sunday, Kurdish lawmakers agreed to divide Barzani s presidential powers between parliament, the judiciary and the government, in the absence of imminent presidential elections and a named successor.   Barzani remains head of the KDP, which dominates parliament and government, and will still sit on the High Political Council, an opaque non-governmental body which emerged after the referendum. He will thus retain his ability to influence policy.    Barzani could therefore mitigate the mounting political chaos. But his position instead highlights the lack of clarity over who is in charge as crucial negotiations with Baghdad get underway over the region s future.   Dominant since he became president in 2005, Barzani has consolidated the power of his office, and boosted his family members  political profiles.   Before the referendum, Barzani s son Masrour was his likely successor, but he has been damaged by his backing for the vote.   Instead, Nechirvan Barzani, Masoud s nephew and the regional prime minister, has moved to the fore. He has gained some of Barzani s newly devolved presidential powers, and maintained ties with the Kurdish opposition, making him a more palatable candidate to mend regional fences. He also enjoys a close relationship with Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan.   On Monday, the United States commended Barzani for stepping down and said it would  actively  engage with Nechirvan, and his deputy, Qubad Talabani, a member of the rival political faction with whom he maintains a good relationship.  Who emerges as the next leader of the Kurdistan Regional Government is anything but straightforward. In addition to an intra-Kurdish compromise, the influence of Baghdad and Iran will have to be considered.   Senior Kurdish officials from both the KDP and PUK say their best bet is to present a united front in negotiations with Baghdad. But that now seems all but impossible.   Iraqi forces, including the Iran-backed Shi ite militias, now control border crossings in the north, vital trade routes for the Kurds. The military capitulation in Kirkuk was a crushing blow to the Kurds, both morally and financially, halving the region s oil export revenue overnight.    Now the Talabanis are facing their own succession crisis, following the death of former president Jalal Talabani.   Iran saw the disintegration of their Kurdish ally in Talabani,  said Mansour, who added Iran needed a clear successor to ensure its continued influence.   Another set of sons and nephews are vying for leadership in the aftermath of the referendum. But the PUK base has expressed more widespread disappointment with how their leadership handled the Kirkuk crisis.   We were betrayed by our leaders in Kirkuk, who stopped us from fighting the (Iraqi Shi ite) militias,  said a PUK-allied Peshmerga commander who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution.  They sold us to Iran for their own benefit.  For a graphic on Iaq's Kurdish zone, click tmsnrt.rs/2yXRWcI ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
Police arrest Japanese man after body parts found in apartment,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese man was arrested on Tuesday after parts of a dismembered body were found in a picnic cooler in his apartment, police said, although media reports said parts of as many as nine bodies may have been discovered. Police made the grisly find in the apartment in Zama, a city just outside Tokyo, after investigating the disappearance of a 23-year-old woman earlier this month. The woman was seen on security camera footage walking with a man near the apartment, media reports said. A police spokesman said Takahiro Shiraishi, 27, was arrested on suspicion of abandoning a body, although it was not clear whose body it was.  Some body parts were found in a picnic cooler, covered with cat litter,  the spokesman said. It was not immediately clear if the suspect had entered a plea or had legal representation.  Kyodo news agency said the unidentified woman posted a message on Twitter saying she was looking for somebody who would die with her. Police declined to comment on media reports about how many bodies were found in the house. Japanese media said there were at least nine - eight women and a man. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

"Blast hits Afghan capital Kabul, numerous casualties","KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber in the Afghan capital Kabul killed as many as eight people and wounded many others, most of whom appeared to be workers leaving their offices at the start of the evening rush hour, witnesses and officials said on Tuesday. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in Wazir Akbar Khan, a heavily fortified area of the city which houses numerous foreign embassies and government buildings. A Reuters television team counted eight people who appeared to have been killed, besides several wounded at the scene, which was shrouded in smoke from the explosion. All the casualties appeared to be Afghan civilians. A public health official said three dead and 15 wounded had been taken to city hospitals but a security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least seven people had been killed and 21 wounded.  The scene of the attack was covered in smoke and dust but I saw seven or eight vehicles loaded with dead and injured people coming out of the area,  said Ali Nazari, the manager of a nearby travel agency. The explosion came at a time of heightened security in Kabul following a series of attacks in October, including one on a Shi ite mosque in the city that killed more than 50 people and a separate attack on an army training facility that killed at least 15 soldiers. Security had already been stepped up considerably following a devastating truck bomb attack outside the German embassy on May 31 that killed at least 150 people, with a series of barriers and checkpoints across the central area of the city. But a Kabul police spokesman said the blast appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber on foot. The target of the attack was not immediately clear but as well as foreign embassies, the area contains a defense ministry department dealing with foreign relations and several private businesses, including a barber and a travel agency. Afghan and Western security officials have said in recent days that they expected more attacks in Kabul in response to pressure being exerted on the Taliban and other insurgent groups by increased U.S. air strikes. In recent months, the U.S. has stepped up its campaign of air strikes as part of a new strategy aimed at reversing gains made by the Taliban and forcing the insurgents to seek peace talks with the Afghan government. Western officials say the campaign has inflicted significant casualties on Taliban fighters in the provinces but say the battlefield losses may push the insurgents to attack Kabul and other high profile targets.

Turkish mayor says forced to quit in Erdogan purge of local government," (Refiles October 30th story to add dropped name in third paragraph) ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish mayor announced on Monday he had quit his post and left President Tayyip Erdogan s ruling AK Party after pressure and threats  beyond unbearable , becoming the sixth mayor in recent weeks to fall victim of a purge of local government. Ahmet Edip Ugur, mayor of the northwestern province of Balikesir, became the first mayor to speak out against the purge, declaring at a news conference that democracy in Turkey was broken and at one point breaking into tears.  There is no corruption, no irregularity, no failures on my side...but despite this, there are pressures and threats coming all the way into your home and to your family. This is beyond unbearable,  Ugur said, adding that he had no ties to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Ankara accuses Gulen s network of engineering a failed military coup last year. Gulen denies involvement. Since that attempted putsch, Erdogan has carried out a wideranging purge of Turkish society, from the military and police to the judiciary and academia. More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to Gulen, while 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from jobs. Erdogan says the action is necessary to root out subversive elements loyal to Gulen and to maintian stability in Turkey. Ugur said he was  sorry, hurt, but in peace , before breaking into tears. Ugur s resignation followed those of the high profile Istanbul and Ankara mayors. Melih Gokcek, a staunch Erdogan loyalist who has been mayor of Ankara for 23 years and won five consecutive elections, quit on Saturday.  I leave my post of mayor upon orders from our leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan,  Gokcek said in a televised speech.  This is not because I think I m unsuccessful, tired or for some other reason. I am solely realising the request of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who I believe will make my country a leading nation.

Tension rises as Australia starts to dismantle Papua New Guinea detention center,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian private security on Tuesday vacated an asylum seeker detention center in Papua New Guinea (PNG) ahead of its planned closure, detainees said, leaving about 600 refugees and asylum seekers barricaded inside and refusing to move. Detainees are defying attempts by Australia and PNG to close the controversial Manus Island center, saying they fear violent reprisals from the local community if they move to a transit center. Despite threats that water and power supply to the camp would be cut by 5 p.m. (0700 GMT), asylum-seekers told Reuters after the deadline that half the camp still had power at 10.30 p.m. (1230 GMT), along with access to water.  The Manus center has been a key part of Australia s controversial  Sovereign Borders  immigration policy. The country refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, detaining them in camps in PNG and Nauru in the South Pacific. Lawyers for some of the 600 men filed a last-minute lawsuit in PNG to prevent the camp s closure and allow the men to be relocated to a third country. A ruling is expected on Wednesday. The detainees were left alone for the first time in more than four years after camp staff all left on Tuesday morning, Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz told Reuters.  The water and electricity are still on but we are vulnerable now after the staff left us all alone,  Aziz said. The camp s impending closure is part of an Australian government plan to push refugees and asylum seekers to return to their home country, settle in PNG or move elsewhere, so dismantling part of the costly and controversial offshore detention program. The United Nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centers. Detainees have consistently raised concerns over how they are treated by locals and authorities in PNG, a country that ranks 154th out of 185 on the United Nation s Human Development Index. Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton refused to comment on the departure of the Australian-employed security staff on Manus, but said the camp s closure would proceed.  All have been informed for a considerable period of time that there is safe and secure alternate accommodation where health and other services will be maintained,  Dutton said in an emailed statement. Australia has already said it would spend up to A$250 million ($195 million) to house the men for the next 12 months. Just under 200 men have already been moved.  The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of refugees as part of a refugee swap deal. Asylum seekers said several unidentified local men had arrived at the camp and taken away furniture from common areas. Videos images shot by the refugees and sent to Reuters show vans loaded with furniture departing, though it is not clear where the vehicles were from. Conditions for the refugees were unbearable, said Nick McKim, a senator with the Australian Greens Party who is on Manus.   I can only describe what is happening on Manus now as a humanitarian emergency,  McKim told Reuters.  It is 31 degrees Celsius (88 Fahrenheit) today and drinking water will be cut off.  PNG has sent paramilitary services to oversee the closure.  PNG s High Court ruled last year that the Manus center, first opened in 2001, was illegal. Most of the detainees come from war-torn countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Syria. Australia s tough offshore detention policies are backed by its two biggest political parties, although community opinion is divided.  I would be absolutely terrified to be in that situation and I cannot understand why the government just simply will not say enough is enough ... we need to bring them here to Australia,  said refugee advocate Dr Barri Phatarfod, who joined in a small protest against refugee policies in Sydney on Tuesday.

German FDP leader presses Greens to compromise on immigration,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Greens need to compromise on immigration policy if talks on forming a new governing coalition are to succeed, the leader of the Free Democrats (FDP) said, putting the chances of a deal at 50-50. Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to form a coalition with the FDP and Greens after her conservatives lost support to the far right in a federal election last month. The three-way alliance is untested at national level.  I still see the biggest differences with the Greens,  FDP leader Christian Lindner said of immigration policy in an interview with the Rheinische Post newspaper.  Germany is at the limit of what the majority are ready to provide in humanitarian aid,  he said, adding that  realism cannot be sacrificed in a readiness for coalition.  The three parties found common ground in areas of social policy and digital infrastructure during talks on Monday, but remained far apart on issues of immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week. Lindner said the Greens did not represent the majority of Germans on the issue of family reunification - allowing foreigners to join loved ones granted asylum in Germany. That is one of the most contentious issues in the coalition talks. All the parties are eager to show the public they are taking measures to prevent a repeat of 2015, when Merkel s decision to welcome people fleeing wars and persecution led to the largest influx of asylum seekers in the post-war years. But the Greens may not accept a conservative plan to suspend the right to family reunions for asylum seekers who have only been granted so-called subsidiary protection, starting in March 2018. The Greens say that would hamper integration. Those given subsidiary protection are given one-year visas that can be renewed, because it is deemed their home country is not safe. But they do not have full refugee status that would give them the right to stay.  In the first phase, we haven t come close to solutions to conflicts,  Lindner said of the exploratory talks on a  Jamaica  coalition, so called because the parties  colors match those of the Jamaican national flag.  Therefore, I still see the chances for Jamaica at 50-50.  European reform is another area of contention between the three party groups. The FDP welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron s push for European integration and would like more security cooperation, Lindner said, but he resisted closer budget and fiscal ties.  We would like to facilitate investment in the euro area. If there is a lack of money for that, we can talk. But joint liability, common risks - whether for national debt or deposits at our savings banks, cooperative banks or private banks - there is no room for maneuver there for the FDP,  he said.

Seven Rohingya refugees drown as crossing to Bangladesh ends in grief,"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Four Rohingya Muslims, a man, woman and two children, drowned when a small wooden fishing boat carrying dozens of refugees fleeing ethnic violence in Myanmar capsized off the Bangladesh coast on Tuesday, police said. Residents of the coastal strip south of the Bangladesh port of Cox s Bazar fished 37 survivors out of the water and 11 have been admitted to hospital in a critical condition, said police officer Mohammad Abul Khair of the area s Ukhiya police station. The boat had keeled over in choppy seas as rain fell. According to survivors they had paid 50,000 kyat ($37) to be taken to Bangladesh, having abandoned their homes in Buthidaung, in the strife-torn north of Myanmar s Rakhine State. In a separate incident at the southernmost tip of the Cox s Bazar district, three Rohingya infants drowned as they slipped from their mothers  clutches when the boat bringing them from Myanmar reached the Bangladesh shore, police official Main Uddin Khan of the region s Teknaf police station told Reuters. The babies, aged between three and 10 months, were lost in the waves pounding the beach. The bodies of two were found on Monday evening, and the third on Tuesday. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since the military in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar launched a counter-insurgency operation after attacks on security posts by Rohingya militants in late August. United Nations officials have described the Myanmar military s action as  ethnic cleansing , an accusation that Myanmar denies. Around 200 Rohingya refugees have drowned since late August, while making the perilous sea and river crossing to the safety of predominantly Muslim Bangladesh.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

"China, South Korea agree to mend ties after THAAD standoff","SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Seoul and Beijing on Tuesday agreed to move beyond a year-long stand-off over the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea, a dispute that has been devastating to South Korean businesses that rely on Chinese consumers. The unexpected detente comes just days before U.S. President Donald Trump begins a trip to Asia, where the North Korean nuclear crisis will take center stage, and helped propel South Korean stocks to a record high. The installation of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system had angered China, with South Korea s tourism, cosmetics and entertainment industries bearing the brunt of a Chinese backlash, although Beijing has never specifically linked that to the THAAD deployment. Beijing worries the THAAD system s powerful radar can penetrate into Chinese territory.  Both sides shared the view that the strengthening of exchange and cooperation between Korea and China serves their common interests and agreed to expeditiously bring exchange and cooperation in all areas back on a normal development track,  South Korea s foreign ministry said in a statement. Before the THAAD dispute, bilateral relations flourished,  despite Beijing s historic alliance with North Korea and Seoul s close ties with Washington, which includes hosting 28,500 U.S. troops. China is South Korea s biggest trading partner.  At this critical moment all stakeholders should be working together to address the North Korea nuclear challenge instead of creating problems for others,  said Wang Dong, associate professor of international studies at China s Peking University.  This sends a very positive signal that Beijing and Seoul are determined to improve their relations.  As part of the agreement, South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam on Nov. 10-11. South Korea recognized China s concerns over THAAD and made it clear the deployment was not aimed at any third country and did not harm China s strategic security interests, China s foreign ministry said. China reiterated its opposition to the deployment of THAAD, but noted South Korea s position and hoped South Korea could appropriately handle the issue, it added.  China s position on the THAAD issue is clear, consistent and has not changed,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily briefing in Beijing. The thaw is a big relief for South Korean tourism and retail firms as well as K-pop stars and makers of films and soap operas, which had found themselves unofficially unwelcome in China over the past year. In South Korea, a halving of inbound Chinese tourists in the first nine months of the year cost the economy $6.5 billion in lost revenue based on the average spending of Chinese visitors in 2016, data from the Korea Tourism Organization shows. The spat knocked about 0.4 percentage points off this year s expected economic growth, according to the Bank of Korea, which now forecasts an expansion of 3 percent. The sprawling Lotte Group, which provided the land where the THAAD battery was installed and is a major operator of hotels and duty free stores, has been hardest hit. It faces a costly overhaul and is expected to sell its Chinese hypermarket stores for a fraction of what it invested. A spokesman for holding company Lotte Corp expressed hope that South Korean firms  activity in China would improve following the announcement. An official at Seoul s presidential Blue House, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the matter, said improvements for South Korean companies would come slowly. Shares in South Korean tourism and retail companies rallied nonetheless, with Asiana Airlines gaining 3.6 percent and Lotte Shopping up 7.14 percent. The benchmark Kospi index hit a record for a third straight day, gaining 0.9 percent. China has grown increasingly angry with North Korea s ongoing pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations sanctions, even as it chafes at U.S. pressure to rein in its isolated ally. The recent deterioration in ties between China and North Korea may have contributed to Tuesday s agreement, the Blue House official said. Pyongyang has undertaken an unprecedented missile testing program in recent months, as well as its biggest nuclear test yet in early September, as it seeks to develop a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States. The head of NATO on Tuesday urged all United Nations members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against North Korea.  North Korea s ballistic and nuclear tests are an affront to the United Nations Security Council,  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in Tokyo, where he met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Separately, a South Korean lawmaker said North Korea probably stole South Korean warship blueprints after hacking into a local shipbuilder s database last April. Expectations had been growing for a warming in the frosty bilateral ties following this month s conclave of China s Communist Party, during which Xi cemented his status as China s most powerful leader after Mao Zedong. Earlier this month, South Korea and China agreed to renew a $56 billion currency swap agreement, while Chinese airlines are reportedly planning to restore flight routes to South Korea that had been cut during the spat. Tuesday s agreement came after high-level talks led by Nam Gwan-pyo, deputy director of national security of the Blue House, and Kong Xuanyou, assistant foreign minister of China and the country s special envoy for North Korea-related matters.

Beijing seen poised for fresh South China Sea assertiveness,"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China has quietly undertaken more construction and reclamation in the South China Sea, recent satellite images show, and is likely to more powerfully reassert its claims over the waterway soon, regional diplomats and military officers say. With global attention focused on North Korea and Beijing engrossed in its Party Congress, tensions in the South China Sea have slipped from the headlines in recent months.     But with none of the underlying disputes resolved and new images reviewed by Reuters showing China continuing to develop facilities on North and Tree islands in the contested Paracel islands, experts say the vital trade route remains a global flashpoint.          Some expect China to land its first deployments of jet fighters onto its runways in the Spratly islands in coming months, while regional military officers say it is already using the new facilities to expand naval and coast guard deployments deep into Southeast Asia.  They ve built these extensive facilities and both Chinese civilian and PLA experts have always made it clear that when the strategic time is right, they re going to start using them more fully,  said Bonnie Glaser, a China security expert at Washington s Center for Strategic and International Studies.  I think it is a question of when, rather than if, China will start to assert its interests more forcefully in the South China Sea ... and that is likely to be at a time of China s choosing,  Glaser told Reuters. Rival claimant Vietnam, meanwhile, is nearing completion of reclamations and an extended runway on its base on Spratly Island, the satellite images show. The build-up of the Spratlys symbolizes China s growing assertiveness over the South China Sea during President Xi Jinping s first term and was highlighted in his address to the Communist Party Congress this month.  Construction on islands and reefs in the South China Sea has seen steady progress,  Xi told the Congress. The issue is likely to come up during U.S. President Donald Trump s visit to Asia, which begins this week.  We remain concerned about tensions in the South China Sea, in particular those caused by land reclamation and militarization of disputed outposts and the willingness of some to resort to coercive tactics to assert their claims,  said Michael Cavey, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department.  We have consistently called on China, as well as other claimants, to refrain from any further land reclamation, construction of new facilities, and militarization of the disputed features.    Responding to Reuters  questions, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang reiterated the islands were irrefutably Chinese territory.  You can t say that the construction on our islands and reefs in the South China Sea and the building of necessary defensive facilities is an expansion of military deployments,  he said.  We believe that at present the situation in the South China Sea is generally good, and all relevant parties should work hard together to protect the peace and stability of the South China Sea.  China s ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, said on Monday the United States should not try to  interfere  in regional efforts to resolve disputes in the South China Sea.    For a graphic on Spratly Islands, click here China has been seeking to soothe fellow claimant the Philippines and accelerating talks with the wider ASEAN grouping, amid concerns in Washington about the long-term security of the waterway through which some $3 trillion in trade a year passes. In a speech in Singapore earlier this month, the most senior U.S. military chief in the region said even while Washington pushed Beijing for help on North Korea, it would still hold China accountable for actions that countered international rules and norms.  We also want Beijing to do more to stop provocative actions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, where the Chinese are building up combat power and positional advantage in an attempt to assert de-facto sovereignty over disputed maritime features,  Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, said. China claims much of the area through its controversial nine-dash line, which overlaps rival maritime claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. A recent study by the U.S. government-linked RAND Corp weighing the risks of a conflict between the United States and China moved the South China Sea up its list of potential flashpoints. Placing it above Taiwan but below the Korean peninsula, the  study notes the waterway has  become the unanticipated focal point of U.S.-Chinese ... rivalry . While the Pentagon has embarked on more regular freedom-of-navigation patrols, or FONOPS, to challenge Beijing s claims, some analysts believe Washington is struggling to counter China s creeping domination of the area.  China appears to be pursuing a well-thought out and long-term strategy to achieve dominion over the South China Sea while America responds with ad hoc tactical maneuvers,  said Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at Singapore s Yusof Ishak Institute.  FONOPS are tactics not strategy, and they have not made China rethink its plans for the South China Sea one iota.  Ni Lexiong, a naval expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said there was little need for China to dramatically increase deployments now, but much depended on the actions others.  As long as others don t intentionally go and provoke clashes, things will be fine,  he added.  The issue is that some countries, like the United States, go and stir things up.

Sri Lanka says keen for early conclusion of China trade deal,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Sri Lanka is keen to reach agreement soon on a free trade deal with China, its foreign minister said on Tuesday, describing Beijing as a close friend and ally, despite strong local opposition to some major Chinese-invested schemes. In July, Sri Lanka signed a long-delayed $1.1 billion deal to lease its southern Hambantota port to China, ignoring an appeal by opposition parties to debate the pact in parliament. The $1.5-billion port, close to the main shipping route from Asia to Europe and likely to play a key role in China s  Belt and Road  initiative, has been mired in controversy since a Chinese firm agreed to take an 80 percent stake in it. The pact signed last year sparked widespread public anger, as Chinese control of the port, which included a plan for a 99-year lease of 15,000 acres (23 sq miles) to develop an adjacent industrial zone, provoked fears it could be used by Chinese naval vessels. Sri Lanka Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana told a reception in Beijing to mark the 60th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties that the two countries  friendship went back centuries.  Sri Lanka is very keen to reach an early conclusion to the free trade agreement with China in the near future that would expand more trade avenues for both countries,  Marapana said.  China has been a reliable and important partner in our drive towards economic development and Sri Lanka is appreciative of the country s commitment and assistance,  he added, without mentioning any specific projects. As one of the first countries to help in Sri Lanka s post-war reconstruction after the 2009 end of its 26-year civil war, China s ties with Sri Lanka have unnerved India, traditionally the island nation s most important partner.     By 2014, Chinese navy submarines were also docking in Colombo, raising alarm in New Delhi and prompting a push by the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to claw back influence in the region.  Sri Lanka is deeply appreciative of China for being a true and trusted friend and ally during our times of need,  Marapana said. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

"Xi, top China party officials, make symbolic visit to Shanghai","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Days after taking over as China s leader in 2012, Xi Jinping led other top Communist Party officials to Beijing s National Museum to visit an exhibit on party history entitled  The Road to Rejuvenation . The museum trip telegraphed what would become  one of Xi s overarching policy priorities in the next five years. On Tuesday, less than a week after being anointed for a second term as party chief at a twice-a-decade party congress, Xi and the other men at the pinnacle of the party made a rare joint visit to China s financial capital, Shanghai, where they paid homage to the party s birthplace and founding fathers. Official photos showed the men at the site of the first party congress in 1921, gazing solemnly at a relief sculpture of the party s original leaders and standing around a wooden meeting table.  This is an important symbolic gesture,  said Willy Wo-Lap Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  It s a reinstatement of the commitment of the party in this so-called  new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics  that they would stick to original values of the founding fathers. That means definitely no move away from orthodox Marxism, orthodox Maoism. No taking up of Western values.  The visit brought parts of the city of 25 million people to a standstill as police blocked roads and highways around the Xintiandi area, home to the modest grey brick building that hosted the first congress. State television showed Xi leading the six other Politburo Standing Committee members, fists raised, in a symbolic retaking of the Communist Party oath. The men then travelled to Jiaxing, in eastern Zhejiang province, visiting a replica of the  Red Boat  on the South Lake - another historic site of the Communist Party s founding.  The Communist Party was born here,  state television showed Xi saying.  These are the roots of the party.  At the congress that ended last week - the party s 19th - Xi consolidated his grip as China s strongest leader in decades, promoting allies and getting his name and signature political platform enshrined in the party charter. Xi is not the first general secretary of the party to try to send a message with a well-publicised trip early in his tenure. Hu Jintao, his predecessor, sought to cultivate a  man of the people  image starting with a visit one month after becoming party chief in 2002 to the town of Xibaipo, a one-time revolutionary base. In December 2012, a month after Xi became party chief, he made a low-key but widely watched trip to Shenzhen, the southern city was where late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping jumpstarted economic reforms in the early 1990s. The visit to Shanghai on Tuesday may also send another message, Lam said. The city had been synonymous with the political patronage network of 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin, who attended the congress.  At the weekend, Xi promoted ally Li Qiang to the role of Shanghai party chief, the city s top job. Li is not from the city, nor has he built his career there.  In January another Xi man from elsewhere, Ying Yong, was appointed mayor. Traditionally, the city s party chief or mayor, or both, have hailed from Shanghai or worked up the ranks there. Having two outsiders is a break with the past.  It shows indirectly that the Shanghai faction under Jiang Zemin has ceased to be a force to be reckoned with,  Lam said.  Now, it s Xi Jinping bringing his own people.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s state prosecutor accused sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont on Monday of rebellion and sedition as the former regional president traveled to Belgium with other members of his ousted administration and hired a lawyer there. As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain. The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed Catalonia s secessionist government, called a regional election for Dec. 21 and said the central government would take direct control. That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.  A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported. Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.  I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,  Bekaert told Reuters.  At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.  Bekaert told Belgian broadcaster VTM that Puigdemont had not fled Catalonia, was not hiding and would make a public appearance in Brussels on Tuesday.  After what he described as an hour-long meeting in his office in western Belgium, the lawyer - who quoted his experience with asylum and extradition cases, as well as with Spain - said his client was in high spirits, driven by  strong support among his backers in Catalonia .  Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.  But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed. A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public-sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started work as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism. A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it. Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices, although some of their staff did.  One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as  normal  and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.  We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,  he said. Some 200,000 public-sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and 100,000 others in the region rely directly on the Madrid government. Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence. Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence, while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. That compared with 41.1 percent in July, according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government. Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent. Spain s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday, who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral. The force has already withdrawn protection for dismissed regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings. The government s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies, which called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain s economy, the euro zone s fourth-largest. Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country s rating.

Tunnel collapse may have killed 200 after North Korea nuclear test: Japanese broadcaster,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A tunnel at North Korea s nuclear test site collapsed after Pyongyang s sixth atomic test in September, possibly killing more than 200 people, Japanese broadcaster TV Asahi said on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation. Reuters has not been able to verify the report. About 100 workers at the Punggye-ri nuclear site were affected by the initial collapse, which took place around Sept. 10, the broadcaster said. A second collapse during a rescue operation meant it was possible the death toll could have exceeded 200, it added. Experts have said a series of tremors and landslides near the nuclear test base probably mean the country s sixth and largest blast on Sept. 3 has destabilized the region, and the Punggye-ri nuclear site may not be used for much longer to test nuclear weapons.

MSF says closing most cholera centers in Yemen as epidemic wanes,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) is closing most of its 37 cholera treatment centers in Yemen, saying the epidemic appears to have peaked. Some 884,368 suspected cholera cases have been recorded in the war-torn country in the past six months, including 2,184 deaths, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization (WHO). The case fatality rate is now 0.25 percent.  The number of cholera cases reported in MSF treatment centers has significantly decreased since the peak of the outbreak. As a result, the medical organization is closing the majority of its cholera treatment centers or reducing their capacity,  MSF said in a statement late on Monday. Some 567 new patients sought treatment for suspected cholera at MSF s centers in nine governorates of Yemen during the second week of October, down from 11,139 at the peak in the third week in June, it said.   Only 9 percent of patients admitted by MSF last week needed to be hospitalized and a limited number of patients have symptoms that correspond with the cholera case definition (acute watery diarrhea with or without vomiting),  it said.  The remaining cases are believed to be due to other pathogens.  Ghassan Abou Chaar, MSF head of mission in Yemen, said:  The cholera outbreak is not over but it is no longer our medical priority in Yemen. However, this should not eclipse the dire health situation of millions of Yemenis who are unable to access basic primary healthcare.  Civil war in Yemen has killed more than 10,000 people since it began in March 2015. Yemen s war pits the armed Houthi movement that controls the capital against the internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition that has launched thousands of air strikes to restore him to power. Cholera epidemics usually subside once the disease passes through a population, but aid agencies say the Yemen epidemic lasted longer and spread wider than they initially expected because of the war s toll on health care. U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said on Sunday that an aid effort by the World Health Organization, United Nations Children s Fund UNICEF, the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) and other agencies had managed to  largely contain the devastating cholera epidemic , but warned it could flare up again without urgent investment in health, water and sanitation. ICRC said last month that the humanitarian situation in Yemen is a  catastrophe , and cholera cases could reach a million by the end of the year. Alexandre Faite, head of the ICRC delegation in Yemen, said at the time that the  health sector is really on its knees in Yemen ... the health staff is on its knees as well because they are not paid.   Preventable illnesses and deaths are increasing in Yemen, and this can be partly attributed to the salary crisis,  MSF said, noting that doctors, nurses and other public health workers had not been paid in 13 months.

Serbia's president eyes early parliamentary vote,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is considering calling the third snap parliamentary elections since 2014 to further cement his Progressive Party s (SNS) grip on power, he said late on Monday. Vucic, a ultranationalist firebrand during the Yugoslav wars of 1990s who a decade later has become committed to joining the European Union, said  people in the SNS are overwhelmingly for elections.   The party is considering holding the parliamentary vote alongside local elections due to take place in the capital Belgrade early next year.   There are serious arguments (in favor),  Vucic said in a live interview with Belgrade-based Pink TV.  To avoid splitting elections and to prepare the country for European Union entry ... as new elections would offer us an uninterrupted time until 2022.  He did not say when the vote would take place.      An alliance led by Vucic s SNS won a comfortable majority of 131 deputies in the 250-seat parliament in 2016 and further consolidated power through a coalition with the Socialists that were led by late strongman Slobodan Milosevic during the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Vucic won in a landslide in a presidential election in April, handing his post of prime minister to hand-picked technocrat Ana Brnabic.  But his rule is facing discontent from public sector employees and pensioners over austerity measures imposed under a three-year 1.2 billion euro ($1.4 billion) IMF loan deal that has stifled spending and growth.  Although it enjoys backing in rural Serbia, Vucic s party is less popular in Belgrade which accounts for almost a quarter of total electorate in the 7.2 million-strong Serbia.  Serbia which wants to join the EU by 2025, must first seek to reconcile its pro-Western integration bid with keeping close ties with Russia, its traditional Slavic and Orthodox Christian ally.   It must also normalize ties with Kosovo, the predominantly ethnic Albanian former southern province, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008.  ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1

Philippine military kills escaping Islamist militant in Marawi,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine troops on Tuesday killed a pro-Islamic State gunman in the southern city of Marawi, a military official said, eight days after the government declared the end of hostilities. Soldiers have focused on securing Marawi against surviving militant fighters since ending five months of operations against Islamic State-inspired militants who seized control of parts of the city in May, in a bid to win a foothold in the region. The conflict displaced about 350,000 residents and killed more than 1,100 people, mostly militants, stirring concern that the southern Philippines is becoming Islamic State s hub in  Southeast Asia.     The military engaged in a gunfight with one of the suspected remaining gunmen in the main battle area, after foiling his bid to escape, army spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner said.  We still have to put in troops, because there s a possibility for stragglers,  Brawner told a news conference in Marawi.  In the main battle area, there are many possible hiding spots.  Indonesians, Malaysians and Middle Easterners were among the fighters who flocked to Marawi to support the Islamic State s emirate in Southeast Asia. Thousands of Marawi residents have started returning home, only for some to find dwellings ransacked. Brawner said an army official and five more personnel were detained in barracks after being charged with looting. The main battle area in downtown Marawi remains off limits, pending the removal of booby traps and unexploded ordnance. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
U.N. picks Norwegian for Myanmar role as tensions simmer over Rohingya crisis,"YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations named a new interim U.N. resident coordinator for Myanmar on Tuesday, appointing Knut Ostby of Norway to take over the humanitarian role at a time of growing strains with the Myanmar government over the handling of the Rohingya crisis. The appointment of a temporary placeholder was expected after Myanmar blocked an upgrade of the U.N. country chief position. Myanmar s de facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, has told diplomats in private meetings that she is frustrated with the United Nations, particularly its human rights arm. Ostby, who has served with the United Nations in a number of hotspots, including Afghanistan and East Timor, will replace Renata Lok-Dessallien, who has completed her term. Some 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh after ethnic violence erupted in Myanmar s northern Rakhine state in late August. Rights monitors and Rohingya refugees say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have forced them to flee their homes. U.N. investigators interviewing Rohingyas living in refugee camps near Cox s Bazar said on Friday they had gathered testimony pointing to a  consistent, methodical pattern  of killings, torture, rape and arson. The fact-finding team, led by former Indonesian attorney general Marzuki Darusman, said the death toll from the Myanmar army s crackdown following Rohingya insurgent attacks on Aug. 25 was unknown, but  may turn out to be extremely high . The U.N. team, which was established by the U.N. Human Rights Council in March, renewed its appeal for access to Rakhine state and for talks with the Myanmar government and military to  establish the facts . In the early stages of the crisis, the United Nations described the military campaign as  ethnic cleansing , an accusation rejected by Myanmar, which says its military was engaged in counter-insurgency operations against Rohingya militants behind a series of attacks on security posts. Suu Kyi has said the refugees can return, but thousands  continue to arrive in Bangladesh. Myanmar, an overwhelmingly Buddhist country with small Christian and Muslim minorities, is struggling to emerge from decades of military rule, and Suu Kyi s democratically elected government is engaged in a peace dialogue with members of various armed ethnic groups.

Turkey's Erdogan takes legal action after lawmaker calls him 'fascist dictator',"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan filed a criminal complaint against a prominent opposition lawmaker on Tuesday, one of Erdogan s lawyers said, after the deputy called the Turkish leader a fascist dictator. In blistering criticism of Erdogan, the spokesman for the main opposition Republican People s Party, Bulent Tezcan, attacked what he said was a  fearful atmosphere  in Turkey. Erdogan s lawyer, Huseyin Aydin, said on Twitter:  We have filed a legal petition concerning Bulent Tezcan with the Ankara chief prosecutor s office for the crime of insulting the president.  Aydin also posted photos of the petition.  The suspect s statements are part of a new campaign against our president and cannot be interpreted as an isolated incident,  the petition said, saying such a campaign had also been launched ahead of last year s attempted coup. In a speech on Monday in the western city of Tekirdag, criticizing local judicial authorities, Tezcan had said:  If you try to scare people and to create a fearful atmosphere by showing legal words as illegal ones we will not be deterred.  His comments appeared to be in defense of the local mayor, a CHP member, who was questioned by authorities this month after he reportedly called Erdogan a  dictator  at a party congress.  I don t know if our mayor said that or not. I, here in Tekirdag, say it now:  Erdogan is a fascist dictator ,  Tezcan said. His comments prompted a swift backlash from Erdogan s office and lawmakers from his ruling AK Party, with Erdogan s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin saying his  hate speech is an example of disgrace for the main opposition . Insulting the president is a crime punishable by up to four years in prison in Turkey. Lawyers for Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, have filed more than 1,800 cases against people including cartoonists, a former Miss Turkey winner and school children on accusations of insulting him. Following the failed coup of July 15 last year, Erdogan said he would drop outstanding suits, in a one-off gesture. Nonetheless, rights groups and some Western governments have voiced concern that Turkey is sliding toward authoritarianism. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs and more than 50,000 jailed pending trial on suspicion of links to the failed coup. Erdogan says such measures are necessary to ensure stability and defend Turkey from multiple security threats. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
China says position on THAAD system in South Korea has not changed,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that China s position on the deployment in South Korea of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system is consistent and has not changed. China has repeatedly opposed the deployment, but earlier on Tuesday Beijing and Seoul agreed to work swiftly to get relations back on track following a year-long standoff over THAAD.

"China considers three-year jail terms for disrespecting national anthem, flag","BEIJING (Reuters) - China s largely rubber-stamp parliament is considering jail terms of up to three years for people who disrespect the national anthem or flag in public, while an existing anthem law will be applied in Hong Kong, state media said on Tuesday. Xi Jinping has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing China from threats both within and outside its borders since taking over as president in 2013, as well as presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech. China passed a new law in September mandating up to 15 days in police detention for those who mock the  March of the Volunteers  national anthem, a law that also covers the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau. Parliament is now looking at whether to amend China s Criminal Law to include criminal penalties for disrespect of the national anthem, including intentionally distorting the lyrics or tune, Xinhua said. The tougher penalties also apply to desecration of the national flag, or emblem, including burning, defacing or trampling on it in public, the report said. That, too, had previously been punishable by up to 15 days  detention. A draft amendment has been submitted for deliberation at a bi-monthly session of parliament s standing committee, which started on Monday.  Violators in this regard may face punishments of up to three years of imprisonment, according to the draft,  it said. It was not clear when the amendment might be passed but it could be at the end of the week, when parliament s standing committee closes its current session. The National Anthem Law, which went into effect on Oct. 1, will also be included in an annex of Hong Kong s Basic Law, or mini constitution, Xinhua added, though it s not clear if that will include three-year jail terms.    The national anthem law has fueled concern in Hong Kong, whose residents have grown nervous over China s perceived encroachment of the city s autonomy following such events as the disappearance of booksellers who later emerged in mainland Chinese custody. In 2015, Hong Kong football fans booed the Chinese anthem during a World Cup qualifier, prompting a fine for the territory s football association from world body FIFA.  In recent years, incidents of disrespecting the national anthem had occurred in Hong Kong, challenging the bottom line of the principle of  one country, two systems  and social morality and triggering rage among Chinese including most Hong Kong residents,  said Zhang Rongshun, deputy head of parliament s Legislative Affairs Commission, according to Xinhua.  It is urgent and important to apply the national anthem law in Hong Kong, in a bid to prevent and handle such offences.  The Asian Football Confederation on Tuesday warned the Hong Kong Football Association about their fans  behavior at a match against Malaysia on Oct 10. in Hong Kong, where some booed the national anthem.

Indonesian police kill two 'terrorists' on eastern island,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian counter-terrorism police killed two militants suspected of having links with a pro-Islamic State network in a shootout on the eastern island of Sumbawa, officials said on Tuesday. Authorities in the country with the world s largest Muslim population are trying to stamp out the spread of radical Islamist ideologies. Its elite counter-terrorism unit, Detachment 88 or  Densus 88 , has notched a string of recent successes against Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) network, a loose organization of radicals loyal to Islamic State. The two militants killed on Sumbawa were suspected members of JAD.  Police said the shootout occurred when counter-terrorism forces ran into a group of four militants while conducting a surveillance operation in a mountainous area near the city of Bima. The two other militants managed to escape.  They had several weapons, different caliber bullets and survival gear,  said national police spokesman Setyo Wasisto. Militants have been traveling between Bima and Poso, on Sulawesi island.  Counter-terrorism operations have decimated the militant group on Sulawesi, and police said there were signs that the militants were turning their attention to Bima.  There is a strong link between the radical group in Poso and Bima. People have been going back and forth and people have received orders to carry out actions in Bima,  Wasisto said. Last week police said eight men were arrested in Riau province, on the central eastern coast of Sumatra, and one man in South Sulawesi province - all of them were suspected of having links to JAD.

Thailand's political activity ban stays for now: PM,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand s military government on Tuesday said it will not yet lift a ban on political activity, despite a general election scheduled for next year and growing pressure from political parties to lift it. The ban on political party gatherings has been in place since the military seized power in a 2014 coup but there have been growing calls from all political groups to end the ban. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha cited persistent political divisions and mud-slinging as reasons why the ban should stay.  We will not lift the ban today but don t be frustrated,  Prayuth told reporters after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.  Today we are still speaking evil. You must stop this so that everyone is at ease,  Prayuth said, urging all sides to put aside their differences. Earlier this month, Prayuth said Thailand would hold a general election in November 2018 - the news was largely welcomed by investors in Southeast Asia s second-biggest economy. There has been little opposition to junta rule since 2014, partly because authorities have arrested and jailed dozens of critics. The government had said that parties needed to wait until after the funeral of Thailand s late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was cremated last week, for a decision on when normal political life will resume. Tensions have been festering in Thailand since 2006 when a coup removed then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Since then, the country has witnessed bouts of unrest including deadly street protests. Thailand is divided broadly between those who align themselves with Thaksin and his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, whose government was removed in the 2014 coup, and the elite in the capital Bangkok. Thaksin is credited by some as being the first Thai prime minister to tap into the potential of the rural electorate. But he made many enemies among the elite who accuse him of corruption - which he denies. Both Thaksin and Yingluck live abroad. Yingluck fled Thailand in August ahead of a verdict against her in a negligence trial for which she was later found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. Thaksin fled to avoid a 2008 jail corruption sentence. Politicians from major parties were upset about the decision not to lift the political activity ban on Tuesday.  I want the junta to show some sincerity about the election by lifting the ban,  Sunisa Lertpakawat, a member of Thaksin s Puea Thai Party, told Reuters.  We haven t got much time.

"North Korea hacked Daewoo Shipbuilding, took warship blueprints: South Korea lawmaker"," SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea probably stole South Korean warship blueprints after hacking into Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co Ltd s (042660.KS) database in April last year, a South Korean opposition lawmaker said on Tuesday.  North Korea has often been implicated in cyber attacks in South Korea and elsewhere but Pyongyang has either ignored or denied accusations of hacking.   We are almost 100 percent certain that North Korean hackers were behind the hacking and stole the company s sensitive documents,  Kyung Dae-soo of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party told Reuters by telephone.  Daewoo Shipbuilding has built several South Korean warships, including an Aegis-class vessel and submarines. It was most likely North Korea had obtained blueprints for these, he said.  The hacking was discovered by a division under South Korea s Ministry of Defence in charge of investigating cases of cybercrime, said Kyung, who received a briefing on the investigation.  How sensitive and classified the seized documents were was not known as that was not disclosed by the investigative team, he added.  A spokeswoman for Daewoo Shipbuilding said she was unaware of the issue until early Tuesday and the company was in the process of confirming the details of Kyung s remarks.  The investigative team came to the conclusion North Korea had hacked Daewoo Shipbuilding because the hacking method was very similar to other attacks that North Korea was thought to be behind, Kyung said.  Hackers in North Korea are believed to have been responsible for a recent cyber heist in Taiwan - the latest in a string of hacks targeting the global SWIFT messaging system.  Earlier this month, another South Korean lawmaker had said North Korean hackers had stolen a large number of classified military documents, including South Korea-U.S. wartime operational plans.  And British authorities said last week they believed North Korea was behind the  WannaCry  ransomware attack in May that disrupted businesses and government services worldwide, including the National Health Service in England.

New Zealand PM says ban on foreign home buyers to start early 2018,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday a ban on foreigners buying existing homes would begin in early 2018, but the restrictions would not apply to Australians. Ardern campaigned in the recent New Zealand election to restrict foreign buyers to reduce demand, while the country tackles what her Labour party says is a housing crisis left unresolved by the previous National administration.  We are determined to make it easier for Kiwis to buy their first home so we are stopping foreign speculators buying houses and driving up prices. Kiwis should not be outbid like this,  said Ardern in an emailed statement, using the colloquial term for New Zealanders. The politically sensitive housing crunch has seen prices rise more than 50 percent nationally in the last decade. In the city of Auckland, prices have almost doubled in that period. The central bank sees fast-rising prices as a major economic risk. The ban would not apply to Australians, Ardern said, given New Zealanders are exempt from home ownership restrictions in  neighboring Australia, where many New Zealanders live. Ardern told reporters that legislation would be introduced in parliament by Dec. 25. The restrictions were being fast-tracked so that Labour would not have to renegotiate foreign investment provisions in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, after a long series of talks to revive the agreement since the United States pulled out in January.  The TPP currently requires its 11 member states to give foreign investors equal treatment to locals unless there are specific exemptions. New Zealand had no such grounds for an outright ban on overseas investment in housing, but its Overseas Investment Act is exempted from the trade deal.  By adding housing to that legislation, Labour will be able to go ahead with the ban without having to request any changes to the TPP when ministers meet on the sidelines of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam next week to finalize the agreement. Ardern said that New Zealand would instead focus on renegotiating rules allowing investors to sue member countries included in the TPP, though she acknowledged it would be difficult to get large changes so late in negotiations. Some government figures show the number of home sales including foreigners is only around 3 percent, though Labour has criticized that data and says it excludes many types of owners, including those who purchase property through trusts.   It is very important that we preserve these rights for New Zealand,  Trade Minister David Parker told reporters. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1
NATO chief urges full implementation of North Korean sanctions to counter global threat,"TOKYO (Reuters) - NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged all United Nation members on Tuesday to fully and transparently implement sanctions against North Korea, which he said has emerged as a global threat able to fire ballistic missiles as far as Europe and North America.  North Korea s ballistic and nuclear tests are an affront to the United Nations Security Council,  North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a joint announcement in Tokyo, where he met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  They pose a global threat which requires a global response,  Stoltenberg said. Pyongyang has undertaken an unprecedented missile testing program in recent months, as well as its biggest nuclear test yet in early September. Stoltenberg s trip to Tokyo comes ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump s first official visit to Asia, which starts in Japan on Sunday. Talks about North Korea are expected to dominate a trip that will include a stop in Beijing, where Trump is expected to pressure China s leadership to act more decisively against Pyongyang. China is North Korea s major ally and trading partner.  Rather than dialogue it is necessary to cause North Korea to change policies by raising the pressure to the maximum,  Abe said in a joint announcement with Stoltenberg. Trump has warned North Korea it would be totally destroyed if it threatened the United States with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. North Korea stoked tensions last week when it reiterated a threat to conduct an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean in a demonstration of its nuclear capability.

Japan to launch crackdown on asylum seekers: Yomiuri,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will curb asylum seekers  rights to work and detain any not deemed refugees or who have made multiple applications, the Yomiuri daily reported on Tuesday, in a move to further tighten one of the developed world s toughest refugee systems. From as early as mid-November, Japan will only allow those it regards as bona fide refugees the right to work. The Justice Ministry estimates that the new rule will effectively deny the right to work for more than 10,000 asylum seekers a year who don t qualify for refugee status, the Yomiuri said, without citing sources.Others, including those who fail to qualify as refugees in initial checks and multiple asylum applicants, will be held in detention centers after their permission to stay in Japan expires, the report said. At present, asylum seekers with valid visas receive renewable permits allowing them to work in Japan while their refugee applications are reviewed - a system the government says encourages people to seek asylum in order to work.  We are looking at policies, including that in the (Yomiuri) article. We haven t decided whether to put it into action,  said Yasuhiro Hishida, a Justice Ministry official overseeing  refugee recognition.  Japan accepted just three refugees in the first half of 2017 despite a record 8,561 fresh asylum applications, and only 28 in 2016. Human Rights Watch in January described the country s record on asylum seekers as  abysmal . The prospect of the crackdown drew criticism from Japan s most prominent refugee organization, which said that asylum seekers would struggle to make ends meet without work permits.  It s essential that minimum living conditions are ensured while people apply for asylum,  said Eri Ishikawa of the Japan Association for Refugees.  The world s third biggest economy has remained unwelcoming to immigration despite a shrinking, aging population that has exacerbated the worst labor shortages in four decades and drags on an already slow economic growth. Japan s reluctance to accept foreign workers and refugees is in contrast to the policies of other industrialized countries, and has forced labor-hungry industries including construction and manufacturing to rely on asylum seekers with work permits. Immigration remains a controversial subject in Japan, where many pride themselves on cultural and ethnic homogeneity.  Almost six in 10 Japanese think diversity of ethnic groups, religions and races makes their country a worse place, a poll this month by the Pew Research Center showed.

"Singapore minister says he, and his colleagues, all prepared to become next PM if called upon","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - One of the contenders to be Singapore s next leader, cabinet member Chan Chun Sing, on Monday said he and his colleagues had an obligation to be ready to take on the job. In rare comments about succession by a public official, Chan said whoever took over was unlikely to drastically change the government s policy direction.  All of us have to be prepared to do the job when called upon,  Chan, a former army chief, told journalists at a Foreign Correspondents Association of Singapore briefing, when asked if he would like the job of prime minister.  In Singapore, leadership is a responsibility to be borne, not a position to be sought,  he said, citing a comment previously made by Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan.  Chan, 47, who holds the title of minister in the prime minister s office, is one of a handful of men mentioned as potential successors to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who has said he is ready to step down in a couple of years. Singapore news media have cited Chan as one of a number of  contenders to succeed Lee.  Lee, who is the eldest son of Singapore s founding father Lee Kuan Yew, has said the new leader is probably already in the cabinet, but a clear choice has yet to emerge. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, also mentioned as a potential successor, has repeatedly said he does not want the job. The Singapore media and political analysts say Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat and Education Minister Ong Ye Kung are also in contention.  Questions about succession in the wealthy Southeast Asian city state - which has been governed by the People s Action Party since independence in 1965 - came into focus when Lee, who has twice survived cancer, took ill during a televised speech last year and stumbled at a podium. Doctors subsequently said there were no serious concerns. Lee Kuan Yew s successor, Goh Chok Tong, was identified at least five years in advance while the current leader, who first entered politics in 1984, was also groomed for the position long before he took office in 2004.  Chan entered politics in 2011 after serving more than two decades in the Singapore Army, retiring as a major-general.

Jakarta closes hotel targeted by Islamists for alleged vice,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia s capital has shut a hotel and spa complex for alleged vice, city officials said on Monday, after Islamist groups in the Muslim-majority country had urged Jakarta s governor to act on a campaign pledge to shut the premises.       The Alexis Hotel, whose website describes it as a  dreamland for men , became embroiled in the city s recent election when the new governor, Anies Baswedan, promised in a televised debate to shut it and accused his predecessor of only acting against more downmarket venues offering vice and drugs. Edy Junaedi, head of the Jakarta Capital Investment and One-stop Integrated Services (PTSP) agency, confirmed by telephone on Monday that the hotel s permit had not been renewed.  In a letter, the city government said it had decided not to extend the permit after  information circulating in media about forbidden activities , adding that it was required to prevent any immoral and illegal activities. Islamist groups had previously sent a letter to authorities demanding the hotel be closed, but later called off a proposed protest rally outside the venue for security and technical reasons, state news agency Antara said.  The hotel did not immediately respond to a request for comment and its owner could not be reached.  Media quoted Baswedan as saying the city would take firm action against any businesses conducting  immoral practices .  The governor faced criticism after winning April s Jakarta election with the support of Islamist groups who had agitated for months against his opponent and former governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama - an ethnic Chinese Christian - whom they accused of blasphemy against Islam. Purnama demolished Jakarta s sprawling Kalijodo red-light district in 2016 as part of a nationwide crackdown on prostitution and also closed a number of notorious Jakarta nightclubs over drug use.   Though illegal in Indonesia, prostitution is rampant in most  cities, and the decision to close the Alexis comes as groups like the hardline Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), which has a history of raiding nightclubs and bars, want Baswedan to impose a more  Islamic lifestyle  on the city of more than 10 million. Novel Bamukmin, head of FPI s Jakarta chapter, has said the group would  push  Baswedan s administration to gradually close down bars and clubs in a city known for a freewheeling nightlife because  It s immoral and...not Islamic culture . Sandiaga Uno, Baswedan s deputy, has said the administration would consider setting up  sharia-inspired  or sharia-compliant entertainment spots similar to those in Abu Dhabi or Dubai.

"Fake news hurts trust in media, mainstream outlets fare better: poll","LONDON (Reuters) - Controversies over fake news have damaged trust in media in the United States and elsewhere, but the impact is far worse for social media and online-only outlets than it is for traditional print and TV outlets, a survey has found. The research and data company Kantar, in a survey of 8,000 people in the United States, Brazil, Britain and France, found that newspapers, magazines and TV news outlets had retained a greater measure of public trust than digital specialists had. In the United States, mainstream media have reported on the online spread of fabricated stories aimed at helping Donald Trump win the presidency last year. Meanwhile, Trump has accused the mainstream media itself of producing fake news. Overall, 58 percent of those surveyed said that as a result of becoming aware of fake news they had less trust in social media news stories about politics or elections. For mainstream media, the figure was 24 percent.  The efforts to brand  mainstream news media  as  fake news  have largely failed,  Kantar said. The survey drew a link between depth of coverage and trust levels. The findings showed that a much higher proportion of people rated magazines, TV news channels, radio and newspapers highly for in-depth commentary and analysis, than did so for social media news.  News audiences are far from dumbing down. They demand serious content and the provision of this type of content will help deepen the nature of consumer relationships with news organizations offline and online,  the survey said. Kantar said its analysis showed usage of the expression  fake news  had surged in mainstream news around the time of the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, and had peaked on Trump s first day in office in January this year. However, there was a lack of consensus and clarity on the definition and origin of fake news.  Asked what that expression meant, 58 percent of respondents said it referred to stories deliberately fabricated by a mainstream news organization. Forty-two percent said it described stories put out by someone pretending to be a news organization. Of the four countries surveyed, Brazil had the highest proportion of people who believed fake news had influenced the outcome of elections in their country, at 69 percent. In the United States, the figure was 47 percent.  The term  fake news  has been used by the U.S. president so frequently that it comes as no surprise that U.S. audiences are more aware of its impact,  the survey said.  In Brazil, however, although a national election has not been held since 2014, a series of corruption scandals have likely raised news audience sensitivity to political news.

Wife of Chechen accused of Putin assassination plot shot dead near Kiev,"KIEV (Reuters) - The Ukrainian wife of a Chechen man accused by Russia of plotting to kill President Vladimir Putin was shot dead outside Kiev on Monday in an attack that also wounded her husband, Ukrainian interior ministry officials said. Amina Okuyeva and Adam Osmayev were in a car that was shot at from bushes near a railway crossing on the outskirts of the capital, interior ministry advisors Anton Gerashchenko and Zoryan Shkiryak said in separate posts on Facebook. The attack follows a vehicle bombing in Kiev last Thursday, in which two people were killed and three wounded, including Ihor Mosiychuk, a member of the populist opposition Radical Party. Okuyeva had links to Mosiychuk, having once worked for him in an advisory role.  As a result of the injuries she sustained, Amina died. Adam Osmayev was wounded, but will live. I just spoke to him on the telephone,  Gerashchenko said. The incident is the second attempt this year on the life of Osmayev, from Russia s mainly Muslim Chechnya region. In June, he survived an attack by a gunman, who was in turn shot and wounded by Okuyeva. Gerashchenko and Shkiryak did not suggest a motive for the latest incident.  Mosiychuk has blamed Russia for last week s bombing, while Ukrainian police have said Russian involvement is one of the possible motives being investigated. Russia has dismissed the accusations as a product of anti-Russian sentiment in Ukraine.  Relations between Kiev and Moscow collapsed in 2014 after Russia seized Ukraine s Crimea peninsula and backed a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukrainian regions. Russian authorities accuse Osmayev of being part of a 2012 plot by Islamist rebels to kill Putin with a bomb in central Moscow. Osmayev and Okuyeva are well-known figures in Ukraine, having served as volunteers for the Ukrainian military in the fight against pro-Russian rebels. Moscow has fought two wars with separatists in Chechnya  since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The region is now broadly under the control of Moscow, but Chechens are known to have fought both for the pro-Russian rebels and for the Ukrainian army in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Since fighting broke out in the east in 2014, the number of incidents involving explosives outside the conflict zone has increased. There has been a spate of vehicle bombings over the past 18 months in Kiev, the capital, and elsewhere, but investigators have failed to find those responsible. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
British government extends Northern Ireland talks deadline,"BELFAST (Reuters) - The British government on Monday extended by 24 hours a deadline for Northern Ireland s political parties to re-establish a devolved regional executive and avoid London setting the region s annual budget for the first time in a decade.  The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party made progress in talks on Monday and they will continue talking on Tuesday, the British government s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said.   In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to Parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed,  Brokenshire said in a statement.  The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night,  he said, adding that the British government would consider  certain additional requests  made by the parties.        Brokenshire had earlier indicated that if there was no deal by the end of Monday it would move to pass an annual budget for the region to ensure essential services are funded.  A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, which observers have warned could destabilize a delicate political balance in the region.  The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province. But Sinn Fein in January pulled out complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.  Talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP have stalled in recent weeks, in large part over proposals to improve the rights of Irish language speakers. Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said the government could only be reformed  on the basis of equality, rights and respect , which would require concessions from the DUP.   While the DUP also said it wanted to see the executive re-established, ahead of the talks it called for London to bring forward the budget  to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland . Neither party spoke to assembled media on the state of the talks on Monday evening.  The outcome of talks was not expected to have an impact on the DUP s agreement to support British Prime Minister Theresa May s government in the British parliament. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Court orders Nigeria to pay $288 million to 1967 war victims,"ABUJA (Reuters) - A court on Monday ordered Nigeria to pay 88 billion naira ($288 million) in damages to victims of the 1967 civil war for failure to fully de-mine and clear the land of other weaponry after the end of hostilities.  The ruling calls on the government to pay 50 billion naira directly to war victims in 11 states and put 38 billion naira toward de-mining and the construction of schools, courts, churches and mosques in the affected areas.  A judge for the Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice ruled that there remain  large quantities  of live bombs deprived communities of farmland since the civil war ended in 1970.

Chile's Pinera says spending plan would cost $14 billion,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile s frontrunning center-right presidential candidate, Sebastian Pinera, on Monday unveiled a $14 billion, four-year spending plan focused on proposed reforms to the country s tax and pension systems and new investments in infrastructure and hospitals. The former president, who governed from 2010 to 2014, said he would pay for his proposals by cutting  unnecessary  government spending and simplifying the tax code to encourage investment and boost growth and the country s coffers. Recent opinion polls show Pinera, 67, with a wide lead over his seven rivals in the Nov. 19 first-round election. Pinera would also beat his two closest contenders, leftists Alejandro Guillier and Beatriz Sanchez, in a runoff if no candidate receives at least 50 percent of the vote, according to pollster CEP last week. Guillier, the frontrunner on the left, has yet to put a pricetag on his proposals, which track the policies of outgoing center-left President Michelle Bachelet. Sanchez has proposed a $13.4 billion plan of deeper social and economic reforms, paid for in part by a tax on the  super-rich.  The 67-year-old Pinera, a billionaire who has campaigned on a program of fiscal austerity, is benefiting from disenchantment with Bachelet, whose program of progressive reforms coincided with a downturn in the price of copper, which can account for as much as 15 percent of gross domestic product in Chile, the world s top producer.  Half of the financing for my program will come from reallocations drawn from ineffective government programs ... and a reduction of unnecessary spending in the public sector,  Pinera said in a 124-page paper detailing his proposals. Pinera s plan to reform the pension system would cost about $3 billion and include new subsidies to raise pensions for women and the middle class, as well as incentives to encourage workers to retire later, Pinera said in the document. The current retirement system, introduced in the 1980s during Augusto Pinochet s dictatorship, was historically seen as a model by many economists, but it has been criticized in recent years on a number of fronts, including what many see as insufficient payouts. Pinera, a businessman-turned-politician, has also called for a $2.7 billion overhaul of Bachelet s tax reform, to provide  more certainty and incentives for saving and investment,  as well as $3 billion of investment in hospitals and infrastructure.

The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and Irish nationalists Sinn Fein will continue talks on Tuesday aimed at restoring a power-sharing government, the British government s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said in a statement.  He said progress had been made in talks on Monday and that he would reassess the position on Tuesday evening before deciding if London would move to impose a budget for the first time in a decade.

Czech Babis gains possible support in bid for minority government,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech billionaire Andrej Babis gained possible support on Monday for his bid to form a minority government with his ANO movement when the small Communist party said it could  tolerate  the prospect. ANO won nearly three times as many votes as its closest competitor in a parliamentary election this month when voters shunned traditional parties but fell short of a majority in the lower house. Since then, the other eight parties that won seats have refused cooperation with ANO with the exception of the SPD, a far-right, anti-European Union party that is not a preferred coalition partner for Babis. The businessman ran on an anti-establishment platform and pledged to fight political corruption but he faces potential fraud charges himself. The ANO has 78 seats in the 200-seat lower house and is considering forming a minority government but it must win a confidence vote with a simple majority of those present. The head of the far-left Communist party (KSCM) said he could tolerate a minority cabinet as a way out of the impasse.  It is a question of how much the government s program would fit us, to tolerate this government,  KSCM chairman Vojtech Filip told Czech Television.  I am not saying we will support it, I am speaking about tolerance.  KSCM with its 15 seats would have to leave the lower house during a confidence vote thus lowering the threshold ANO would need to win. President Milos Zeman, who will meet with Babis on Tuesday, told Czech Radio a minority government would be a good option. Most parties shun Babis and his ANO party because of the fraud charges. Police say he hid ownership of a farm and conference center near Prague in 2008 so he could qualify for a 2 million euro EU subsidy normally meant for small businesses. Babis denies wrongdoing and says the charges were politically motivated. ** For a GRAPHIC of election results: tmsnrt.rs/2vO4hPW ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Britain moves to tackle abuse in a bastion of tradition: parliament,"LONDON (Reuters) - There will be zero tolerance of sexual harassment in Britain s parliament, the government said on Monday, toughening rules after allegations of abuse at the 800-year-old institution fueled demands for reform. After sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted hundreds of thousands of women and men to share stories about inappropriate behavior, Britain s parliament - a bastion of tradition - has been no exception.     Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered an investigation into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys and the opposition Labour Party has suspended one of its lawmakers while it looks into his comments and behavior. The growing scandal could damage May if there are further allegations against members of her Conservative Party as it relies on a small Northern Irish party for a majority in parliament.  On Monday, May made a rare appearance in parliament to sit beside leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom as she set out the government s plans to tackle sexual harassment, including measures to enforce a code of conduct and to set up an independent grievance procedure.  We absolutely are determined to get a grip on this,  Leadsom told parliament, outlining government plans for a  zero-tolerance  approach. But critics said measures should go further and tackle the culture in parliament, where some female politicians said power was concentrated in lawmakers  hands and wielded often unchecked over more junior workers.   There is obviously a problem, it s a good thing that it s been exposed,  Labour lawmaker Harriet Harman said.  No one should have to work in the toxic atmosphere of sleazy sexist or homophobic banter.  The allegations against Weinstein - who denies all accusations of non-consensual sex - has prompted discussion of sexual harassment around the world. Last week, Labour lawmaker Jared O Mara was suspended for reportedly making slurs against a woman he dated and other comments, and at the weekend, Mark Garnier, a junior trade minister, was reported by the Mail on Sunday newspaper to have asked his secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy sex toys and called her  sugar tits . On Sunday, May ordered an investigation and wrote to the speaker for advice on changing the culture in parliament, where aides, researchers and secretaries are dependent on their employers, the lawmakers.  She is deeply concerned at the recent media reports regarding the alleged mistreatment of staff by some members of parliament,  May s spokesman told reporters.  She has been clear that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable in any walk of life and she strongly believes it s important that those working in parliament are treated properly and fairly.  But in a sign the scandal may widen, British media carried unconfirmed reports that parliamentary aides have drawn up a list of other allegations of inappropriate behavior in parliament. The list could not be confirmed by Reuters.  Are you on the list?  one male member of parliament asked another on Monday in the presence of a reporter, to nervous laughter.

Major Venezuelan opposition parties to boycott local polls,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Three of Venezuela s largest opposition parties vowed on Monday to boycott mayoral polls later this year in protest at an election system they say is biased in favor of President Nicolas Maduro s ruling socialists. The multi-party Democratic Unity coalition has had a tough 2017, first failing to bring down Maduro in four months of protests that led to 125 deaths, then losing surprisingly to the Socialist Party in a gubernatorial election earlier this month.  That has left the opposition weakened and divided, and Maduro strengthened, despite growing foreign pressure on his government over alleged rights abuses and corruption, and an unprecedented economic crisis that has millions skipping food. Three heavyweight movements in the opposition - Justice First, Popular Will and Democratic Action - announced on Monday they did not trust the government-leaning election board sufficiently to participate in the municipal polls in December.  Justice First leader Julio Borges, who also heads the opposition-led congress, said authorities cheated in the 2013 presidential election, denied Venezuelans a recall referendum last year, and rigged the Oct. 15 gubernatorial vote.  So instead of going into another  manipulated  vote, the opposition should focus on demanding reforms to the election board in anticipation of next year s presidential poll, he said.  The objective remains getting Nicolas Maduro out of power, and in this struggle, the world is with us,  he told reporters.  To the surprise of some, the Democratic Action party also joined the boycott. Its candidates won four governorships in October s vote and then infuriated many opposition supporters by swearing loyalty to a pro-Maduro legislative superbody.  Opposition supporters have been split over participating in elections this year. Some say it is the only way to show they are a majority and undermine Maduro, while a growing number argue there is no point in fighting a  dictator  via a system rigged in his favor.  They are pinning their hopes on international action, including U.S. sanctions against Maduro s government.  Maduro, whose personal popularity has plunged since his 2013 election due to food shortages and runaway inflation, said  sabotage  and  insurrection  were being planned against the mayoral votes.  I declare myself in battle,  the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez said in a meeting with governors on Monday.   Those who attack the election system must pay.  Opposition leaders say the government has long been rigging elections by gross abuse of state funds in favor of socialist candidates, and dirty tricks such the last-minute moving of vote centers in opposition areas for the October ballot.  They have also presented some allegations of ballot-rigging. However, Maduro insists Venezuela s system is entirely trustworthy and impossible to hack. It has received international praise in the past, although it was slammed over July s vote for the Constituent Assembly superbody.  Maduro says the street protests earlier this year were a mask for a U.S.-backed coup plot, and accuses opponents of wanting to oust him by undemocratic means.   Venezuelans want ballots, not bullets,  said Maduro. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
German parties start to find common ground in coalition talks,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Parties seeking to form Germany s next government found common ground in areas of social policy and digital infrastructure on Monday, but remain far apart on issues that provoked stormy clashes last week. Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.  The weekend pause for thought did us good,  said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed. But Monday s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week. One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. Der Spiegel magazine reported the FDP might head a weakened finance ministry, with key European affairs functions hived off to another ministry.  The finance ministry is a strong ministry and should remain so in future,  Altmaier told Die Zeit. Altmaier runs Merkel s office and has been acting finance minister since Wolfgang Schaeuble s move agreed last month to leave the post and become president of parliament . Negotiators emerged on Monday with a document spelling out areas where they had reached agreement, including commitments to universal gigabit-speed internet by 2025, and spending 3.5 percent of economic output on research and development. After discussions that ran late into the evening, they also signed up to Merkel s election campaign pledge of achieving full employment, without giving a specific target date. Merkel, whose conservatives came first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 national elections must forge a so-called  Jamaica  coalition - named because the three camps  colors match that country s flag - that is untested at national level. Three more rounds of more detailed exploratory talks are planned for this week and four for next. If successful, the parties can then begin formal coalition talks. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Finnish president says joining NATO would require referendum,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Any move by Finland to join NATO would need public approval via a referendum, President Sauli Niinisto told a panel debate on Monday ahead of elections in January. The Nordic country is a member of the European Union but has stayed outside the NATO military alliance in line with its tradition of avoiding confrontation with Russia, with which it shares an 833 mile (1,340 km) border and a difficult history. It has forged closer ties with NATO in recent years, however, sharing information and taking part in military exercises, reflecting concerns in Finland about the Ukraine crisis and increased East-West tensions in the Baltic Sea. Niinisto, who is expected to easily win a second six-year term in the Jan. 28 election, did not indicate whether he favoured joining NATO but said a decision to apply for full membership would require a referendum.  I am convinced that (membership) decision would require legitimacy, a wide acceptability... I would warn against making decisions where a significant part of citizens would get deep wounds,  Niinisto said in a panel discussion in Helsinki.     Only 21 percent of Finns support joining NATO, while 51 percent are opposed, a poll by YLE showed in February. Niinisto, 69, who will stand as an independent candidate after previously representing the conservative National Coalition Party, is known for cultivating good relations with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Finland s president is in charge of foreign and defence policy together with the government.  Nils Torvalds, the only one of seven presidential candidates who advocates joining NATO, said politicians needed to show leadership on the issue.  The thesis of a referendum blocks the discussion on membership. Everybody s waiting for a referendum and are not taking a stance on the real question ... We do have a parliament to decide on issues.   To apply for a membership when a crisis is knocking on the door, forget that. The membership must be applied for when the weather is still rather beautiful.  Torvalds, a politician for Swedish People s Party of Finland, had 1 percent support in a recent opinion poll while Niinisto had 76 percent. Finland s centre-right government has said it will monitor the security situation in the region and retain the option of joining NATO. Russia, which has opposed NATO s eastward expansion has said any move by Helsinki to join would be of  special concern .  ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
U.S. captures suspected Benghazi attack militant,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. forces have captured a militant who is believed to have played a role in a 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, U.S. officials said on Monday. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that U.S. Special Operation Forces captured the militant in Libya in the past few days.  Two of the officials identified him as Mustafa al-Imam and said he had played a role in the attack and the ambassador s death. The officials said the man was now in the custody of the Department of Justice and being transported back to the United States by the military.  They added that the operation was authorized by President Donald Trump and had notified the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord. In a statement, Trump said al-Imam  will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks. [nW1N1N000Y] Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack. The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said. The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack. Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah. Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel. Militants have exploited chaos following Muammar Gaddafi s 2011 downfall. Islamic State took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city.  Islamic State militants has shifted to desert valleys and inland hills southeast of Tripoli as they seek to exploit Libya s political divisions after their defeat in Sirte. The United States has been carrying out strikes against the militant group in Libya, striking more than a dozen militants in September. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1

Cameroon court sentences opposition leader to 25 years in prison,"DOUALA, Cameroon (Reuters) - A military court in Cameroon sentenced an opposition leader on Monday to 25 years in prison, his lawyer and Amnesty International said and denounced the trial as politically motivated. The court convicted Aboubakar Siddiki, the president of northern Cameroon s main opposition party, of hostility against the homeland as well as revolution and contempt of the president over accusations he plotted to destabilise the country.  We are going to appeal this decision, which does not seem to us to be at all just,  Siddiki s lawyer, Emmanuel Simh, told Reuters. In a statement, Amnesty said the prosecution was part of a government campaign to stifle its critics. The government denies the charges are political. Dozens of people have been killed and hundreds arrested in a crackdown in recent months on protests in Cameroon s English-speaking regions. Residents there say they suffer social and economic marginalisation in the predominantly Francophone country.  The protests have become a lightning rod for opposition to President Paul Biya s 35-year rule.         Besides Siddiki, the court sentenced Abdoulaye Harissou, a well-known notary, to three years in prison for failure to denounce a crime. The court also dropped charges against three journalists arrested in connection with the same case. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
"Convoy rolls into Damascus suburbs with aid for 40,000: U.N.","GENEVA (Reuters) - A convoy from the United Nations and Syrian Arab Red Crescent entered towns in the besieged Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta on Monday, bringing aid to 40,000 people for the first time since June 2016, the United Nations said. A tightening siege by government forces has pushed people to the verge of famine in the eastern suburbs, residents and aid workers said last week, bringing desperation to the only major rebel enclave near the Syrian capital. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Twitter they had entered the towns of Kafra Batna and Saqba. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent said in a separate tweet that the inter-agency convoy had 49 trucks.  They carried food, nutrition and health items for 40,000 people in need, OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said.  The last time we reached these two locations were in June 2016,  he said. A health worker in Saqba who was present when the convoy started to offload said that nine trucks of foodstuffs, including milk and peanut butter, and four trucks of medicines had arrived so far.  Technical specialists were on board to assess needs in the towns in order to plan a further humanitarian response, he said.  More aid to complement today s delivery is planned in the coming days,  Laerke added. At least 1,200 children in eastern Ghouta suffer from malnutrition, with 1,500 others at risk, a spokeswoman for the U.N. children s agency UNICEF said last week. Bettina Luescher, spokeswoman of the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP), said the convoy carried nutrition supplies for 16,000 children. Food, fuel and medicine once travelled across frontlines into the suburbs through a network of underground tunnels. But early this year, an army offensive nearby cut smuggling routes that provided a lifeline for around 300,000 people in the enclave east of the capital. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
"U.S., Qatar agree to further curbs on terrorist financing","DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar has agreed to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation with the United States to crack down on illicit financing of militant groups, a joint Qatari-U.S. statement said on Monday following a visit by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin s visit to Doha marked the end of a week-long trip aimed at curbing terrorist financing. There were earlier stops in Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, where the U.S. in May announced the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, a U.S.-Gulf initiative to stem finance to militant groups. Following talks with Qatari officials in Doha, Mnuchen said the two countries had agreed to  substantially increasing the sharing of information on terrorist financiers,  with  greater emphasis on charitable and money service business sectors in Qatar,  according to the statement. Qatar is keen to show it is cooperating on counter terrorism nearly five months after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt began a diplomatic and trade boycott of the gas-rich state, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with their arch-foe Iran, allegations Doha denies. Qatar in July signed a memorandum of understanding with the United States to increase cooperation on fighting terrorism finance and was one of six Gulf nations last week to announce sanctions on 13 individuals said to be al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.  Qatar hosts Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, from which U.S.-led coalition aircraft stage sorties against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

At least five killed in east Congo clashes: Human Rights Watch,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - At least four civilians and a police officer were killed in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday in clashes between security forces and protesters demanding the departure of President Joseph Kabila this year, Human Rights Watch said. The national electoral commission announced this month that an election to replace Kabila, whose mandate expired last December, cannot take place until April 2019. The delay has raised fears of an escalation of violence in Congo, which is Africa s biggest copper producer. Activist groups in the eastern city of Goma had called for a general strike on Monday to protest against the election delay. Unrest broke out by 5 a.m. (0300 GMT) between police and protesters, who barricaded roads and burned tires, local residents and the police said. Security forces killed at least four civilians and one police officer also died in the clashes, said Ida Sawyer, central Africa director at New York-based Human Rights Watch.  A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in Congo said it had documented 37 arrests but could not yet confirm a death toll. Provincial police commissioner Placide Nyembo said that the police officer was beaten to death by protesters and one demonstrator was killed by a stray bullet.  The police also said in a statement that they broke up a planned demonstration in the northern province of Tshopo by protesters with jerrycans filled with petrol.  Deteriorating security across Congo this year, including a spike in militia violence, has prompted fears the country could slip back to the multi-sided civil wars of the turn of the century, when hundreds of thousands were killed in violence and millions are believed to have perished of hunger and disease.  Kabila says the election delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters. His opponents say he plans to change the constitution to remain in power, as other African leaders have done.

WFP chief gets pledge from Congo's president on food aid access,"GENEVA (Reuters) - President Joseph Kabila has agreed to help aid reach a region of the Democratic Republic of Congo where ethnic conflict has spawned a humanitarian emergency, the head of the U.N. s World Food Programme said on Monday. WFP Executive Director David Beasley said he had also asked Congo s Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala to waive $9 million in administrative fees the organization had paid to the government, saying the sum could feed tens of thousands of people.  This country is destabilizing and it needs attention because if we don t give the attention now it could impact the entire region,  Beasley told reporters by phone from Kinshasa.  The conflict in Kasai region turned Congo into the world s biggest displacement crisis this year. Although many people have started going home, Beasley said Congo still had about 600,000 children on the brink of starvation and 7.7 million severely malnourished people. While visiting Kasai, where WFP has 1 percent of the $135 million needed for the next eight months, he said he saw horror in the eyes of women and children as they told of beheadings and brutality.   The Kasai region, it was rather appalling, in ways that are truly hard to explain, in ways you actually don t want to explain,  he said. Beasley said he met Kabila for about 45 minutes before meeting ministers and explained that the trust of aid donors needed to be rebuilt and that the government must provide access, safety and visas.   He gave me his assurances that he would do everything possible to address any and all needs that we brought to his attention,  Beasley said. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, told Congo s prime minister that WFP had paid the government $9 million in administrative fees  just for access, just for being here , and asked him to scrap the fees.  As I told the government, the prime minister, and the ministers, if you take that $9 million and I m feeding people at 31 cents a day, you can do the math - that s 75,000 people, give or take, that we can feed in an entire year,  he said. Asked about the $9 million, government spokesman Lambert Mende said:  That s the first time I ve heard of anything like that.   We know that we have humanitarian needs because many people (in Kasai) are returning to their homes and we are working with our partners on that,  Mende said. Beasley said there was donor fatigue but addressing the Kasai situation immediately would save lives and money. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
U.S. pledges up to $60 million for security in Sahel region,"UNITED NATIONS/ABIDJAN (Reuters) - The United States has promised up to $60 million to support the Group of Five Sahel States (G5 Sahel) Joint Force s counter-terrorism efforts, the State Department said on Monday. The force - which will eventually comprise nearly 5,000 troops units from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania - is meant to counter a growing jihadist threat in West Africa s arid Sahel region that includes groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State. The U.S. support for the G5 force falls short of an expectation by France and others that Washington would back direct funding from the United Nations.  We believe that the G5 force must be, first and foremost, owned by the countries of the region themselves,  said the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley in remarks to the Security Council, following news of the new cash commitment.  We expect that the G5 countries will take on full regional ownership of the force within a period of three to six years, with continued U.S. engagement,  she said. A non-U.S. Security Council diplomat said, however, the U.S. is keen on continuing to look for some kind of direct U.N. involvement in supporting the G5 force. An ambush by unidentified militants this month in Niger killed four U.S. Special Forces troops and threw a spotlight on American involvement in counter-terrorism operations in the region.  The funds pledge, which must now be discussed with Congress, will bolster the U.S. s regional partners in their fight against Islamic State and other terrorist networks, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in the statement. Washington is wary of funding the G5 through the United Nations at a time when the Trump administration is aiming to cut U.N. expenditures on peacekeeping operations around the world, and has indicated it prefers to support the force on a bilateral basis. The G5 countries have set a first-year operating budget of just under $500 million, and about a quarter of that was committed before the U.S. announcement. A donors conference will be held in Brussels in mid December. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Turkey threatens legal action after lawmaker calls Erdogan 'fascist dictator',"ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan s spokesman threatened a prominent opposition lawmaker with legal action on Monday for calling the Turkish leader a fascist dictator. In some of the most blistering criticism of Erdogan by a high-profile politician in recent memory, Bulent Tezcan, spokesman for the main opposition People s Republican Party, attacked what he said was a  fearful atmosphere  in Turkey.  If you try to scare people and to create a fearful atmosphere by showing legal words as illegal ones we will not be deterred,  Tezcan said in a speech in the western city of Tekirdag, criticizing local judicial authorities. His comments appeared to be in defense of the local mayor, a CHP member, who was questioned by authorities this month after he reportedly called Erdogan a  dictator  at a party congress.    I don t know if our mayor said that or not. I, here in Tekirdag, say it now:  Erdogan is a fascist dictator ,  Tezcan said. Tezcan s comments prompted a swift backlash from Erdogan s office and lawmakers from his ruling AK Party.  Bulent Tezcan s hate speech is an example of disgrace for the main opposition,  Erdogan s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said on Twitter.  This is not politics, but rather enmity towards the people s will. Legal measures will be sought in this regard.  Insulting the president is a crime punishable by up to four years in prison in Turkey Lawyers for Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, have filed more than 1,800 cases against people including cartoonists, a former Miss Turkey winner and schoolchildren on accusations of insulting him. Following a failed coup in July 2016, Erdogan said he would drop outstanding suits, in a one-off gesture.  Nonetheless, rights groups and some Western governments have voiced concern that Turkey is sliding toward authoritarianism. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs and more than 50,000 jailed pending trial on suspicion of links to the failed coup. Erdogan says such measures are necessary to ensure stability and defend Turkey from multiple security threats. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
"Argentina's Macri vows to pursue tax, labor, pension reforms","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina s President Mauricio Macri vowed to press ahead with reforms to the country s tax, labor and retirement systems in a speech on Monday, a week after his  Let s Change  coalition swept to victory at the polls in midterm elections. The government will present a tax reform proposal this Tuesday or Wednesday, and an amnesty plan for companies that hired workers informally in the coming days, Macri said. He added that the government would convene a commission to propose changes to the retirement system in coming weeks. The speech marked a roadmap for the second half of Macri s four-year term, as he seeks to implement business-friendly reforms to attract investors who avoided the country during more than a decade of populist rule.   We need lower taxes, more public works, and all this we need to achieve with fiscal balance,  Macri told a gathering of lawmakers, governors, union leaders, judges and others. Investors have been encouraged by the reforms Macri has implemented since taking office in December 2015, including lifting foreign exchange controls, settling with holdout creditors, and lowering export taxes. But significant investment has not arrived. Companies have demanded lower costs, while credit agencies are concerned about a deep fiscal deficit.  Macri s coalition swept the five most populous areas in  midterm elections, giving him a broader mandate to pass reforms, though it still lacks majorities in both chambers of Congress. Macri said his government had reduced the country s tax burden, and wanted to make the system  simpler, clearer, and fairer.   He reiterated the government s aim of slashing Argentina s fiscal deficit by one percentage point of gross domestic product per year. And he also vowed to reform the country s retirement system, a large driver of government spending.   We need to start a mature and honest conversation about our retirement and pension system,  Macri said.  Our retirement system hides serious inequities, and it is not sustainable.   While Macri has said he does not plan major changes to the country s labor code, he has said the government plans to provide incentives to companies to formalize undeclared workers and work with unions in specific sectors to lower costs. Macri also pledged reforms to the country s justice system to combat corruption. Cabinet Chief Marcos Pena told journalists that the resignation on Monday of chief prosecutor Alejandra Gils Carbo, appointed during the former administration of President Cristina Fernandez, was a step towards making the judiciary more independent.

Kenyan President Kenyatta wins 98 percent of vote in repeat election,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta won 98 percent of the vote in a repeated election in which an opposition boycott helped lower turnout to 39 percent, the electoral commission said on Monday. The announcement touched off small protests in a few opposition strongholds but also celebrations in pro-Kenyatta areas. Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga said the Oct. 26 election was a farce. Civil society groups also cited problems with the vote. The violence has for the most part seen protesters clash with police but some Kenyans fear it is starting to take on ethnic overtones after two deaths in clashes between rival groups at the weekend. At least 66 people have died in overall election violence. On Monday, the U.S. ambassador said Washington was  profoundly concerned  by the outbreaks of violence since the re-run. Kenya is east Africa s richest economy and a key security ally of the West against militant Islam. It also a key regional trade, logistics and trade hub. In his victory speech, Kenyatta repeated his belief that his victory in the original Aug. 8 election was legitimate and said dialogue would have to wait if the opposition was going to lodge court cases again. The Supreme Court nullified the Aug. 8 vote on procedural grounds.  My victory today is just part of a process that is likely to once again be subjected to a constitutional test through our courts ... I will submit to this constitutional path regardless of the outcome,  Kenyatta said.   Those who are going to ask me:  Are you going to engage in dialogue?  ... Let them (the opposition) first and foremost exhaust all their constitutional options.   Kenyatta took 98 percent of the vote, results from 266 out of 291 constituencies showed. The electoral commission said 7,616,217 valid votes were cast, representing 39 percent of the 19.6 million registered voters.  Protests by Odinga s supporters prevented polling stations from opening in 25 constituencies.  The election commission said poor security prevented voting in those areas but the final announcement could go ahead as it would not  materially affect  the result.  In the pro-Kenyatta area of Dagoretti North in Nairobi, cars honked and crowds of supporters in red T-shirts ran through the streets.   I m so happy the president has got his seat back,  said Peterson Njau.  Now the economy is going to lift up again.   Another resident, Kennedy Okeyo, said he cared more about football than politics but that ethnic clashes in his home this weekend had unnerved him.   You can t get to work, and even if you get to work, you can get attacked because of who you are,  he said.  But just down the road in Nairobi s Kawangware slum, around 100 youths listening to the results on mobile phones chanted  No Raila No Peace . They lit a bonfire in the middle of the street and began taunting riot police with cries of  the people want teargas .  Earlier, police dispersed protesters there with teargas when they tried to block a visit by Interior Minister Fred Matiang i. Another Nairobi shanty town, Mathare, the scene of deadly clashes between police and protesters immediately after the August vote, was largely calm although a handful of protesters lit a small fire.  And in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga s political heartland, around 50 youths began to block the road at the Kondele roundabout, the epicenter of protests, while others banged metal poles together. But the protest was small.   What can I do? They ve already announced it. Even if I burn tires, nothing will change,  said 25-year-old laborer Kennedy Omondi as he watched young men set a barricade alight.  Odinga pulled out of last week s vote, saying the electoral commission had failed to institute reforms to forestall the kind of  illegalities and irregularities  that scuppered Kenyatta s victory in the August election.  Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu, a coalition of civil society organizations with 2,000 election observers, said there were  multiple  cases where results from polling stations differed from results on the forms posted on the election portal after last week s vote.  In a report, they supplied a photo taken by their observers of the tally sheet for Bashaal market center in Garissa. It showed 133 votes for Kenyatta while the form displayed online showed 433 votes. Another form posted on the election website, from Tumbeni primary school in Kakamega, showed four votes for Odinga and two for another minor candidate but recorded the total number of votes cast was 77 votes cast.

One body found near wreckage of Russian helicopter off Svalbard,"OSLO (Reuters) - The body of a man who died when a Russian Mi-8 helicopter crashed off the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard on Thursday was found near the crash site at the bottom of the sea, the office of the governor of Svalbard said on Monday. Eight Russian men   five crew and three passengers   died on board a helicopter that crashed on Thursday on its way from the abandoned Pyramiden settlement to the coal mining port of Barentsburg.  The deceased was located by an ROV (remotely operated underwater vehicle) on the ocean floor approximately 130 meters (142 yards) from the helicopter,  the office of the governor of Svalbard said in a statement on its website on Monday. This was the first body located after the crash. The other seven individuals are missing, presumed dead. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Afghan Taliban say kidnapped U.S. professor is seriously ill,"KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban said on Monday that Kevin King, one of two professors from the American University of Afghanistan who were kidnapped in Kabul last year, is seriously ill and needs urgent medical attention.  Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said King, an American, was suffering from  dangerous  heart disease and kidney problems.  His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,  Mujahid said in a statement.   We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,  he said. The U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of King and other hostages. King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital. Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.  The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.  Earlier this year, the Taliban released a video of King and Weeks showing them pleading with their governments to release Taliban prisoners in turn for their freedom. Kidnapping high profile targets has become a lucrative business for the Taliban and other militant groups in Afghanistan who in return often demand huge ransom or release of their members.

France releases brother of ex-Burkina president Compaore,"PARIS (Reuters) - A court in Paris on Monday released the younger brother of former Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore pending consideration of a request by the Burkinabe government to have him extradited, his lawyer and a judicial source said.  Police detained Francois Compaore at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris on Sunday on an international arrest warrant related to the 1998 murder of Norbert Zongo, who published Burkina Faso s Independent newspaper. The killing of Zongo, who had been investigating the murder of a driver who worked for Francois Compaore, became a symbol of repression during Blaise Compaore s 27-year rule, which ended in 2014 at the hands of a popular uprising.  Francois Compaore is barred from leaving France until a court examines an extradition request by Burkina Faso s government, said a judicial source, speaking on condition of anonymity.      Compaore s lawyer Pierre-Olivier Sur said the charges against his client are politically motivated by a Burkinabe government unable to try Blaise Compaore, whom the government of neighboring Ivory Coast refuses to extradite.  Blaise Compaore fled to Ivory Coast during the uprising. He faces an international arrest warrant in connection with the 1987 murder of former President Thomas Sankara. Activists are pushing President Roch Marc Christian Kabore to aggressively pursue cases of past human rights abuses. Critics say his government has been too slow to move against former government members, some of whom serve in the current administration. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Liberia's Johnson Sirleaf rejects accusations of election interference,"MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf s spokesman on Monday denied allegations from her own party that she meddled in this month s presidential election. The dispute has cemented a falling out between Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and her party s leadership after 12 years in power that saw the country consolidate a post-war peace but draw sharp criticism over alleged corruption and underdevelopment. At a news conference on Sunday, leaders from Johnson Sirleaf s Unity Party accused the president of holding inappropriate private meetings with election magistrates before the Oct. 10 vote. They accused her of showing greed  in its most callous form  with the  intent of disrupting the fragile peace of Liberia , and backed a challenge to the first round results brought by other parties before the country s election commission.  Unity Party s candidate, Vice President Joseph Boakai, placed runner-up in the first-round with 28.8 percent of the vote to front-runner George Weah s 38.4 percent, setting up a second round run-off scheduled for Nov. 7.  The office of the president wishes to state unequivocally that these allegations are completely baseless and an unfortunate attempts by agents provocateurs to undermine Liberia s democratic process,  Johnson Sirleaf s spokesman, Jerolinmek Piah, told reporters. He said that all of the president s meetings with election officials were  consistent with her constitutional role to ensure that the process was supported .   These allegations fall in the category of hate speech and inciting language which should be condemned by all peace loving Liberians,  Piah added. Liberia s economy has quadrupled under Sirleaf s watch, but the forested country remains impoverished and many have no access to reliable drinking water and electricity. Tired of the monied elite that they say Johnson Sirleaf represents, many voters see Weah as the candidate for change.  Boakai has served as Johnson Sirleaf s vice president since her inauguration in 2006 but Johnson Sirleaf declined to endorse him and he distanced himself from the last administration. The election commission was expected on Monday to hear the challenge to the first round results brought by the Liberty Party of third-place candidate Charles Brumskine with the backing of Unity Party and the All Liberian Party of businessman Benoni Urey.

"France, keen to avoid student anger, plans 1-billion euro university reform","PARIS (Reuters) - France announced a one-billion-euro plan for universities on Monday, promising to offer more places on popular courses, cut drop-out rates and build more accommodation, in a bid to assuage the concerns of politically powerful students. President Emmanuel Macron s government has already faced down street protests over labour reform and risks more industrial action over plans to reform the pension and unemployment insurance systems. It wants to avoid confrontation with students who have forced past governments into policy u-turns with protracted rallies. The government said the 1 billion euros ($1.16 billion) will be spent over the five years of Macron s term in office.  Students in France who pass high school exams have the right to go to university in their home area. But this has led to popular subjects such as law and psychology being heavily oversubscribed and prompted the introduction of an unpopular lottery system where demand is highest. That lottery system will now be scrapped and the most pressed universities will be allowed to select students on merit. The proposal stops short of a blanket UK-style selection system that student unions had opposed.  France s biggest student union, the moderate Fage, welcomed the plan. Two other unions, including the left-wing Unef, the second largest, were critical. Unef has said it will join CGT-led protests against government reforms on Nov.16 and urged students to  make their voice heard  against the education reform.     Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, has also urged students to mobilise after his early attempts to get workers onto the streets against the easing of unemployment laws failed. Macron  has got the advantage for now, let s not hide it,  Melenchon told franceinfo radio.  If youths got moving, things would be different, but it s not the case for now.  The reforms also include 60,000 new student housing units over the next five years and promise to scrap student s social security contributions and increase tutoring. Only 40 percent of students complete the first year of university, the government said.  Our aim is to ensure equal opportunities,  said University Minister Frederique Vidal.  We want to make university more accessible by accompanying students, in all their diversity.  ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Brazil's Meirelles jokes about a vice presidential candidacy,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil s Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles insisted on Monday that he is not planning to run for president and told a business meeting he could consider being a vice presidential running mate. But he later told reporters that it was just a joke and he was too busy working on the recovery of the Brazilian economy as minister to consider the presidential race next October. Meirelles, whose political fortunes are expected to rise as the Brazilian economy recovers from its worst recession, said he had been asked to be a vice presidential candidate in 2010 and 2014 and found the position  interesting.  Meirelles said he expected Brazil s GDP to grow at least 2 percent next year and the strengthening economy had created more than 1 million jobs so far this year. Inflation slowing to below bottom-end of the official target range will allow the central bank room to cut interest rates further, Meirelles added. If Brazil s Congress fails to approve the reform of the pension system proposed by the government, the task will be the first challenge of the next president who will take office Jan 1, 2019.

China warns against attempts to contain Beijing before Trump visit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China s ambassador to Washington said on Monday U.S. President Donald Trump s state visit to Beijing next week was a historic opportunity to boost cooperation between the world s two largest economies, but warned against attempts to  contain  Beijing. Cui Tiankai also stressed the urgency of efforts to find a negotiated solution to the crisis over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs and warned of a  more dangerous  situation if  tensions between the United States and Pyongyang continued. Cui sought to play down differences over China s massive trade surplus with the United States, saying Beijing was looking for ways to cut this and he was confident of  significant outcomes  from Trump s Nov. 8-9 visit on the trade and economic fronts. Speaking after senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, outlined an Asia-Pacific strategy involving greater cooperation between Japan, India, and Australia in the face of China s rise, Cui said relationships should not be seen as a  zero-sum game  at the expense of another county.  I don t think it will really serve the interests of these countries if their aim is to sort of contain China ... I don t think anybody would be able to contain China,  he said. Cui said Washington should not try to  interfere  in regional efforts to resolve disputes in the South China Sea, a vital strategic waterway that China claims, most of which is contested by several Asian countries.  Maybe it would be better for the U.S. to let the regional countries ... find a way a way of managing the situation.   Cui was asked about a call on Friday by a senior U.S. State Department official for revival of four-way dialogue between the United States, Japan, India and Australia to deepen security cooperation and coordinate alternatives for regional infrastructure financing to  predatory  Chinese options.  I don t think any attempts to form exclusive clubs in the region ... would help anybody,  he said.  When people are saying these things about China, they might just look into the mirror...it might be describing themselves.  Despite the cautionary words, Cui said he was sure the summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be successful, following on from their first meeting in Florida in April.  This is a historic opportunity,  he said. Cui reiterated China s call for Washington to return to talks, while stressing Beijing s willingness to step up pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. sanctions.  We are ready to take up more cost and make greater efforts if there are more Security Council resolutions  he said. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
"Senior Tanzania ruling party MP quits, cites democracy concerns","DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - A senior Tanzanian politician quit the ruling party on Monday complaining of human rights abuses and a weakening of democracy in the east African nation, in a move political analysts said could trigger a wave of defections to opposition parties. Since taking office in late 2015, President John Magufuli has introduced sweeping reforms, including as an anti-corruption drive that has won him some praise from Western donors. But his administration is also increasingly being accused by his opponents of undermining democracy by curbing dissent and stifling free speech, including banning newspapers. On Monday, Lazaro Nyalandu, who once served as a cabinet minister and has been a member of parliament for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party for 17 years, said he was  deeply concerned  by human rights abuses and the direction of the economy.  It is evident that CCM has lost its way judging from the current political climate, leadership and economic trajectory in Tanzania,  Nyalandu said in a statement.  I have decided to resign from my position as a member of the CCM national executive committee and all other leadership positions in the party effective from today.  Nyalandu said he had also submitted his resignation as a member of parliament. The veteran politician was among more than a dozen candidates who sought the ruling party s presidential nomination in 2015 but was defeated by Magufuli. Bashiru Ally, a Dar es Salaam-based political analyst, said Magufuli s reforms could prompt further defections from the ruling party but said the opposition was poorly placed to benefit from such a trend.  Opposition parties are overly dependent on personalities who defect from CCM,  he told Reuters.  (But) they can only make temporary gains from such defections. They are not institutionalised and lack mass grassroots mobilization strategies.  CCM, which has been in power since Tanzania gained independence from Britain in 1961, has seen its support among young urban voters decline in previous elections, but opposition parties are too fragmented to oust it from power, analysts said.

UK's Johnson says 1917 Jewish homeland declaration terms 'not fully realized',"LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign secretary Boris Johnson said on Monday that a key proviso of a 100-year old British declaration which laid the foundations for Israel had not been fully met, striking a sympathetic tone towards the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to travel to Britain on Thursday to meet his British counterpart Theresa May and Johnson for the anniversary of the Balfour declaration which said Britain viewed with favor  the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people .  Palestinians have long condemned the declaration - named after Arthur Balfour, then the British foreign secretary - as a promise by Britain to hand over land that it did not own. In an article written for the Daily Telegraph newspaper ahead of Netanyahu s visit, Johnson described himself as a  friend of Israel , but also said he was  deeply moved by the suffering of those affected and dislodged by its birth.   The vital caveat in the Balfour Declaration - intended to safeguard other communities - has not been fully realized,  he said referring to the clause in the document which said nothing should prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities. May met Netanyahu earlier this year to talk about boosting trade after Brexit, but also raised the diplomatic sore point of Israeli settlements in occupied lands on which the Palestinians hope to create an independent state. Johnson also made reference to the settlement issue in his article, saying that a two state solution must include a viable and contiguous Palestinian state alongside a  secure Israel , and proposed seeking a peace agreement based on 1967 borders with mutual territorial swaps. A similar call in 2011 by then-U.S. president Barack Obama drew a blunt rebuke from Netanyahu, who said Israel would never pull back to its 1967 borders - something which would mean big concessions of occupied land. Netanyahu contends this would leave Israel with indefensible borders. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on Britain last year to apologize for the Balfour Declaration, saying that his people had suffered greatly as a result of it. Earlier this year Britain said it there would be no apology for the declaration, and said it continued to work for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Britain does not classify Palestine as a state, but says it could do so at any time if it believed it would help peace efforts between the Palestinians and Israel. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
"Putin opens monument to Stalin's victims, dissidents cry foul","MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin inaugurated a monument to the victims of Stalinist purges on Monday, but Soviet-era dissidents accused him of cynicism at a time when they say authorities are riding roughshod over civil freedoms.  The Wall of Grief  occupies a space on the edge of Moscow s busy 10-lane ring road and depicts a mass of faceless victims, many of whom were sent to prison camps or executed on Josef Stalin s watch after falsely being accused of being  enemies of the people.  Nearly 700,000 people were executed during the Great Terror of 1937-38, according to conservative official estimates.    An unequivocal and clear assessment of the repression will help to prevent it being repeated,  Putin said at the opening ceremony.  This terrible past must not be erased from our national memory and cannot be justified by anything.  His words and the ceremony amounted to one of his strongest condemnations of the Soviet Union s dark side in the 18 years  he has dominated Russia s political landscape.    Putin has in the past called Stalin  a complex figure  and said attempts to demonise him were a ploy to attack Russia. But at Monday s ceremony, he said there were lessons for Russia.  It doesn t mean demanding accounts be settled,  said Putin, who stressed a need for stability.  We must never again push society to the dangerous precipice of division.  Putin s carefully balanced words reflect Kremlin unease over this year s centenary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, which paved the way for Stalin s rise. Uncomfortable about promoting discussion of the idea of governments being overthrown by force, the Kremlin is not organizing any commemorative events. Putin, who is expected to run for and win the presidency again in March, told human rights activists earlier on Monday that he hoped the centenary would allow society to draw a line under the tumultuous events of 1917 and to accept Russia s history -  with great victories and tragic pages . Yet some historians fret that what they say is Putin s ambiguity about Stalin along with Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimea have emboldened Stalin s admirers.  Monuments and memorial plaques honoring Stalin have sprung up in different Russian regions. State-approved textbooks have softened his image, and an opinion poll in June crowned him the country s most outstanding historical figure. By contrast, those who have helped document Stalin s crimes, from the Memorial human rights group to individual historians and journalists, have sometimes felt themselves under pressure from the authorities.  A group of Soviet-era dissidents published a letter on Monday, accusing Putin of cynicism.  We ... consider the opening in Moscow of a monument to victims of political repression untimely and cynical,   they said in the letter, published on the Kasparov.ru news portal.  It s impossible to take part in memorial events organized by the authorities who say they are sorry about victims of the Soviet regime, but in practice continue political repression and crush civil freedoms.

Austrian coalition talks begin in earnest with hunt for savings,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Coalition talks between Austrian conservative Sebastian Kurz s party and the far-right Freedom Party began in earnest on Monday as they combed through the nation s finances in search of billions in savings to fund planned tax cuts. Kurz, who is just 31, needs a coalition partner to form a stable government since his People s Party won this month s parliamentary election but fell well short of a majority. He started coalition talks with the third-placed Freedom Party last week. Although both parties  similarly hard lines on immigration dominated the campaign, they have also promised billions in tax cuts and said much of the funding will come from greater efficiency in Austria s administration, which includes a generous welfare state. Having laid out a roadmap for negotiations at their first round of talks on Wednesday, an overview of the country s finances was the main order of business at their second meeting, on Monday.  What we can say today is that there is a significant potential for greater efficiency and that of course we will sound out in the coming days what can be done politically,  Elisabeth Koestinger, chairwoman of Kurz s party and part of his negotiating team, told a news conference after Monday s talks. Neither she nor the Freedom Party s envoy to the joint news conference would be drawn on where those savings would be found.  We did not find any holes,  the Freedom Party s deputy leader, Norbert Hofer, who came close to winning last year s presidential election, told the news conference.  The issue will be better administering this state, reducing loss-causing inefficiencies and then making this released potential available through (tax) relief,  he added. Talks in the 10-person group that includes Kurz and Strache will continue through the week and negotiations in 20 more specialized groups will begin on Tuesday, Koestinger said.  We had a rough overview (of the public finances) from civil servants in the Finance Ministry and we will go into more detail in the coming days,  Koestinger said. Little of substance has emerged from the talks so far. Kurz has said he hopes a deal can be reached before Christmas, and the atmosphere has appeared to be good. Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache said last week the talks made a  very, very good start . Kurz said on Wednesday that he and Strache, 48, address each other with the informal German  du . Strache told tabloid daily Kronen Zeitung the same day that they are on first-name terms, adding:  He calls me HC.  ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
British government extends Northern Ireland talks deadline,"BELFAST (Reuters) - The British government on Monday extended by 24 hours a deadline for Northern Ireland s political parties to re-establish a devolved regional executive and avoid London setting the region s annual budget for the first time in a decade.  The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party made progress in talks on Monday and they will continue talking on Tuesday, the British government s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said.   In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to Parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed,  Brokenshire said in a statement.  The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night,  he said, adding that the British government would consider  certain additional requests  made by the parties.        Brokenshire had earlier indicated that if there was no deal by the end of Monday it would move to pass an annual budget for the region to ensure essential services are funded.  A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, which observers have warned could destabilize a delicate political balance in the region.  The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province. But Sinn Fein in January pulled out complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.  Talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP have stalled in recent weeks, in large part over proposals to improve the rights of Irish language speakers. Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said the government could only be reformed  on the basis of equality, rights and respect , which would require concessions from the DUP.   While the DUP also said it wanted to see the executive re-established, ahead of the talks it called for London to bring forward the budget  to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland . Neither party spoke to assembled media on the state of the talks on Monday evening.  The outcome of talks was not expected to have an impact on the DUP s agreement to support British Prime Minister Theresa May s government in the British parliament. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Argentina's head prosecutor resigns under government pressure,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina s top prosecutor quit on Monday under pressure from the government over accusations that she hampered corruption investigations into officials from the previous administration of President Cristina Fernandez.  Alejandra Gils Carbo, whose resignation will take effect on Dec. 31, was appointed chief prosecutor during populist Fernandez s second term and stayed in the post under business-oriented President Mauricio Macri. Macri, in office since late 2015, accused Gils Carbo of failing to bring corruption charges against members of Fernandez s cabinet. Gils Carbo is herself the focus of a corruption investigation cantering on her tenure as lead prosecutor. She has denied corruption allegations. At a press conference in July, Macri described Gils Carbo as a  political activist  who misused her power as attorney general.  After repeatedly calling for her resignation, Macri s government began a campaign for reforms that would allow for Gils Carbo s firing, which ultimately prompted her to step down. In her resignation letter, Gils Carbo told Macri she was concerned that his actions would end up hurting state institutions by  significantly affecting the autonomy of the public prosecutor s office.  Gils Carbo resigned one week after a powerful minister from the Fernandez era was arrested following a vote in Congress that stripped him of his parliamentary immunity in two corruption cases. The former minister, Julio De Vido, is the most powerful official from the Fernandez administration to be jailed. Macri s coalition was empowered by midterm elections on Oct. 22, and he has pledged more reforms. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
"Bahrain convicts activist's family members, militant suspects","DUBAI (Reuters) - A Bahrain court sentenced three family members of a prominent activist to jail terms on weapons charges on Monday, rights group the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said and accused authorities of using torture to extract confessions. In a separate case, Bahrain s Public Prosecutor announced on Monday that it had sentenced 19 unnamed defendants to prison terms for contacts with a banned party it says is backed by Iran and involved in militant attacks. The cases underscore how authorities in the kingdom is cracking down on perceived threats nearly six years after pro-democracy protests inspired by the  Arab Spring  were quashed with help from Gulf Arab neighbors. Bahrain hosts the U.S. Fifth Fleet. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD s head of advocacy, said his relatives were convicted based on confessions gained by torture and said the court was persecuting the family for his activism. Alwadaei s mother-in-law Hajer Mansoor and brother-in-law Sayed Nizar Alwadaei were each sentenced to three years in jail for planting a  fake bomb,  BIRD said, while his cousin Mahmood Marzooq was sentenced to a month and half for obtaining a knife. Representatives of the Bahraini government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Alwadaei, who is based in Britain, said he believed the case against his relatives was motivated by his human rights work and especially a protest last year in which he took part against the attendance of Bahrain s king at a royal horse show in Britain.  I was distraught to see my family suffer torture, persecution and interrogations about my activities ... I will not rest until they are freed,  Alwadaei said in a statement. Bahrain, which has a Shi ite Muslim majority population and is ruled by a Sunni royal family, denies clamping down on dissent. The government, citing years of deadly bombing and shooting attacks against its security forces, says it faces a militant threat backed by arch-foe Iran. According to the prosecutor, a court sentenced eight defendants to life terms, nine to 15 years and two for ten years for  conspiring with a foreign state and terrorist organisation working for its interests and receiving funds from it to carry out hostile acts and in order to harm national interests.  Fifteen of the defendants had their citizenship revoked. The group it cited was the Islamic Wafa Movement, a political party that is banned in Bahrain and which authorities accuse of receiving money and support from Iran. A leader in Wafa, Murtada al-Sanadi, an exiled Bahraini cleric who was named by the United States this year as a  specially designated global terrorist  and appears to be based in the Iranian city of Qom.

Detained Ethiopian opposition chief bailed two years after protests: party,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - An Ethiopian opposition leader was due to be released on bail almost two years after he was detained during mass protests over land rights, a member of his party said on Monday. Bekele Gerba, secretary general of the Oromo Federalist Congress, was arrested in December 2015 as activists stepped up demonstrations accusing the government of seizing their land and passing it on to firms and developers. Violence went on to spread across the Oromiya province that surrounds the capital Addis Ababa and is home to many foreign-owned businesses, drawn in by the government s industrialisation push. Bekele would walk free late Monday or early Tuesday after the high court granted him 30,000 birr ($1,110) bail, the party s current deputy leader, Mulatu Teshome, told Reuters. Bekele, who denies all wrongdoing, was initially charged with involvement in terrorism and collusion with the secessionist Oromo Liberation Front, which the government has branded a terrorist group. A court reduced those charges to inciting violence in August, but denied him bail then, as prosecutors said he would flee. Nearly 700 people died in one bout of unrest during months protests in 2015 and 2016, according to a parliament-mandated investigation.  Rallies over land rights then broadened into demonstrations over political restrictions and perceived rights abuses, including the incarceration of Bekele and his colleagues. The party s chairman Merera Gudina remains behind bars since his arrest in December last year on charges of colluding with an outlawed group. The violence has fueled fears about security in Ethiopia, the region s biggest economy and a staunch Western ally. Last week, at least five people were killed in a town of Ambo after police opened fire during a protest over sugar shortages. A week before that, ethnic clashes killed at least 11 people in the same region, while another bout of violence along Oromiya s border with the country s Somali region last month displaced hundreds of thousands of people.

Nigeria's Buhari sacks top civil servant after corruption probe,"ABUJA (Reuters) - President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday sacked Nigeria s most senior civil servant after an investigation into graft allegations, the highest profile casualty of the anti-corruption pledge that helped bring him to power. He ordered an investigation into Babachir Lawal, an ally and one of his first appointments, after lawmakers in a separate probe alleged that he inflated the value of contracts for humanitarian aid projects in parts of the northeast ravaged by Boko Haram as part of a suspected kickback scheme.    The president accepted the recommendation of the panel to terminate the appointment of Mr Lawal,  presidential spokesman Femi Adesina said in a statement.  Secretary to the government of the federation Lawal, who has denied wrongdoing, did not immediately respond to phone calls and a text message requesting a comment.     Buhari s two presidential spokesmen declined to comment on whether there were plans to prosecute Lawal.  The director general of the National Intelligence Agency (CIA), Ambassador Ayo Oke, was also sacked on Monday in connection with the discovery of large amounts of cash in foreign and local currencies by the financial crimes agency in a residential apartment in Lagos this year, Adesina said. The discovery of more than $43 million in cash was investigated by the same panel, led by the vice president, as had looked into Lawal, but any connection between the two cases has not been made clear. Both men were suspended in April. The NIA had insisted it was the owner of the money. The agency, Nigeria s equivalent of the CIA, could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday.      Buhari took office in May 2015 after winning an election largely on his promise to end the endemic corruption that has stunted development in Africa s biggest economy, but there have been no major convictions.      A number of former government officials have faced criminal charges related to alleged corruption since Buhari came to power. The opposition People s Democratic Party, in power for 16 years prior to Buhari taking office, has accused the president of focusing on its members. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1

Kurdish parties opposed to Barzani report attacks on offices overnight,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish political parties opposed to regional leader Masoud Barzani reported attacks on their offices in several cities overnight, hours after Barzani announced his resignation, brought low by a failed push for independence. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the Movement for Change and Gorran said in separate statements several of their offices in the Duhok region, north of the Kurdish capital Erbil, were looted or burnt overnight. No casualties were reported. The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq said it had ordered the local police forces, known as Asayish, to stop the attacks.  Barzani, 71, said on Sunday he would give up his position as president on Nov. 1 after an independence referendum he championed in northern Iraq backfired and triggered military and economic retaliation by the Iraqi government. The veteran guerrilla leader has run Iraq s Kurdish autonomous region since 2005, presiding with a firm hand as the region prospered while the rest of Iraq struggled in civil war. But he but has been brought low in recent weeks by his decision to push the independence vote, and his downfall has exposed deep fractures among the Kurds. Armed protesters supporting Barzani stormed parliament as it met on Sunday to approve his resignation. Opposition lawmakers who had been barricaded inside managed to leave later, according to their parties. The PUK, which has been the main rival of Barzani s Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) for decades, supported his decision to hold the independence referendum, but half-heartedly. The reformist Gorran party opposed the vote, arguing that the timing was poor. In a televised speech announcing his plan to step down, Barzani said followers of his longterm rival, PUK founder Jalal Talabani who died in early October, had been guilty of  high treason  for handing over the oil city of Kirkuk to Iraqi forces without a fight two weeks ago. Kurdish fighters known as Peshmerga had held Kirkuk, one of Iraq s main oil centres, since 2014 when they seized it after government troops fled in the face of an advance by Islamic State. Although Kirkuk is outside the borders of the Kurdish autonomous region, Kurds consider it the heart of their homeland. This month, Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi ordered his forces to recapture it and all other disputed territory in retaliation after Barzani staged the independence referendum, which Baghdad considers illegal. The Iraqi body in charge of supervising media in Baghdad issued on Sunday a ban on two major Kurdish TV channels close to Barzani s KDP: Rudaw and Kurdistan 24. The Baghdad-based Communication and Media Commission accused the two networks of  inciting violence and hatred.   This is an assault on freedom of press and expression,  replied Erbil-based Kurdistan 24 s management in a letter to the International Federation of Journalists. Rudaw accused Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitaries who are operating alongside government forces on Monday of killing a Kurdish journalist, Arkan Sharif, in the region of Kirkuk. While the Iraqi Kurds have mostly shown outward unity since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, they have a deep history of conflict between Barzani s KDP and Talabani s PUK, which fought each other in a civil war in the 1990s. The KDP is based mostly around Erbil, the regional capital, while the PUK draws its support mostly from Suleimaniya, the other main city in the region. The two political parties run separate units of Peshmerga, their former underground guerrilla armies that have since become the official security forces of the Kurdish autonomous region. After Saddam s fall, Barzani ran the Kurdish autonomous region while his rival Talabani served as ceremonial president of all of Iraq in Baghdad from 2005-2014. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1

Bahrain calls for freezing Qatar out of GCC,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain will not attend December s summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council if Qatar does not change its policies and Qatar should have its membership in the six-nation group suspended, Bahrain s foreign minister said. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of financing terrorism. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott is an attempt to impinge on its sovereignty and rein in its support for reform.   If the situation remains as it is we won t attend this summit,  Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said on Twitter, referring to the GCC meeting in Kuwait.  The right step to preserve the GCC is to freeze Qatar s membership in the council,  he said. Founded as a bulwark against neighbours Iraq and Iran, the Western-backed GCC is a loose association of the six Gulf Arab countries.  Qatar has pursued policies aimed at the security of member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council ... Qatar has proved that it does not respect the charters, treaties and ties established by the GCC,  Saudi state TV channel quoted Bahrain s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa as saying on Monday. Bahrain believes Qatar is fomenting unrest in the island kingdom by supporting protests and even sporadic shooting and bombing attacks aimed at security forces. In an interview with U.S. broadcaster CBS News broadcast on Sunday, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said he wanted an end to the dispute and warned against any military escalation.

Saudi Arabia to extract uranium for 'self-sufficient' nuclear program,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to extract uranium domestically as part of its nuclear power program and sees this as a step towards  self-sufficiency  in producing atomic fuel, a senior official said on Monday. Extracting its own uranium also makes sense from an economic point of view, said Hashim bin Abdullah Yamani, head of the Saudi government agency tasked with the nuclear plans, the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE). In a speech at an international nuclear power conference in Abu Dhabi, he did not specify whether Saudi Arabia seeks to also enrich and reprocess uranium   steps in the fuel cycle which are especially sensitive as they can open up the possibility of military uses of the material. The world s top oil exporter says it wants to tap atomic power for peaceful purposes only in order to diversify its energy supply and will award a construction contract for its first two nuclear reactors by the end of 2018.  Regarding the production of uranium in the kingdom, this is a program which is our first step towards self-sufficiency in producing nuclear fuel,  Yamani told a conference organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  We utilize the uranium ore that has been proven to be economically efficient.  Atomic reactors need uranium enriched to around 5 percent purity but the same technology in this process can also be used to enrich the heavy metal to higher, weapons-grade levels. This issue has been at the heart of Western and regional concerns about the nuclear work of Iran, Saudi Arabia s foe, and led to the 2015 deal in which Iran agreed to freeze the program for 15 years for sanctions relief. On Monday, IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said Iran was complying with the nuclear deal signed with world powers and which U.S. President Donald Trump has called into question. Under the agreement, Iran can enrich uranium to 3.67 percent purity, around the normal level needed for commercial power-generation. Saudi Arabia would be the second country in the Gulf Arab region to tap nuclear after the United Arab Emirates, which is set to start up its first, South Korean-built reactor in 2018. The UAE has committed not to enrich uranium itself and not to reprocess spent fuel. Industry sources have told Reuters Saudi Arabia is reaching out to potential vendors from South Korea, China, France, Russia, Japan and the United States for its first two reactors.  The plans have received extra momentum as part of Saudi Arabia s Vision 2030, an ambitious economic reform program launched last year by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Yamani said Saudi Arabia will soon pass laws for its nuclear program and will have set up all of the regulations for its nuclear regulator by the third quarter of 2018.   The IAEA also has been requested to conduct an integrated review of our nuclear infrastructure during the second quarter of 2018,  he said, which will allow the agency to assess efforts to prepare Saudi infrastructure  to introduce nuclear power for peaceful purposes.  Saudi Arabia is considering building some 17.6 gigawatts of nuclear capacity by 2032, the equivalent of about 17 reactors, making it one of the strongest prospects for an industry struggling after the 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan. Preliminary studies have estimated Saudi Arabia has around 60,000 tonnes of uranium ore, Maher al Odan, the chief atomic energy officer of KACARE said at an electricity forum in Riyadh on Oct 11.

Danish submarine owner admits dismembering body of Swedish journalist: police,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish inventor Peter Madsen has admitted to dismembering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on board his submarine in August and dumping her body parts in the sea, but he still denies killing her, police said on Monday. The police said in a statement Madsen had told them in an Oct. 14 interrogation that Wall, 30, had died from carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine, while he was on the deck of the vessel. The police would now gather additional information from coroners and submarine experts from the Danish defense command. In past court hearings, Madsen said that Wall had died accidentally after being hit by a heavy hatch cover on his UC3 Nautilus submarine.   The police said they would now extend the charges against Madsen - which already include murder and mutilating Wall s body - to include sexual assault without intercourse, based on 14 interior and exterior stab wounds to the journalist s genitals.  Kim Wall had suffered 14 stabs in and around the genitals and it is due to these stabs that we have said that there must have been a sexual motive,  police spokesman Jens Moller Jensen told journalists in Copenhagen.  Madsen denies the murder and sexual assault charges. The cause of death was still unknown, said Jensen.  Wall, a freelance journalist who was researching a story on Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17-metre (56-foot) submarine in August. On Aug. 23, police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall s. Wall s arms as well as her and Madsen s mobile phones are still missing and the police are currently assessing if divers should continue the search for them.  Earlier this month, police said they had also recovered Wall s head and legs. They said they found no skull fracture, despite Madsen s earlier account that she had been hit on the head by the hatch cover.  The submarine is one of three that Madsen built, and one of the largest of its kind privately produced in the world. It could carry eight people and weighed 40 tonnes fully equipped.  The case has been scheduled to run for eight days at Copenhagen s district court from March 8 2018. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1

Russian teenager handed jail sentence in Norway explosives case,"OSLO (Reuters) - A Norwegian court sentenced a 17-year-old Russian citizen to nine months in jail on Monday for making a small explosive device and bringing it to the center of Oslo in April. Prosecutors had sought a two-year sentence for the teenager, saying he had frequented Islamist websites, become radicalised and possessed images of Islamic State members killing prisonners.  The teenager, who denied any wrongdoing, said he had been planning to detonate the device in a forest near his home. The device was placed in central Oslo on a busy Saturday night in April, one day after a truck attack in Stockholm in neighboring Sweden killed five people.   The Oslo police bomb squad said the device was about 30 cm (1 ft) across and appeared capable of causing only a small amount of damage.[L8N1HH0LT] Soon after the discovery of the device, Norwegian police raised the country s security threat level. The teenager has lived in Norway since 2010 and has previously applied for asylum. The status of that application was not immediately clear.  In 2011, far-right mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik set off a car bomb in Oslo that killed eight people and destroyed Norway s government headquarters, before going on a shooting rampage, killing 69 people at nearby Utoeya island.

U.S. urges cooperation after Kurdish leader's resignation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday urged Iraq s federal government and Kurdish Regional Government institutions to resolve their disagreements after Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said he would resign later this week.  We call on all Kurdish parties to support the KRG as it works to resolve pending issues over the remainder of its term and prepare for elections in 2018,  U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement commending Barzani s decision. It urged Iraq and the KRG  to work urgently to resolve pending issues under the Iraqi constitution.  The statement appeared to reflect a U.S. belief that the departure of Barzani, whose Sept. 25 independence referendum is widely seen has having backfired, may make it easier for the two main Kurdish factions to work together and to negotiate with the federal government led by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. In the statement, Nauert stressed a U.S. desire to work with KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani, Masoud Barzani s nephew and a fellow member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) faction, and with Deputy Prime Minister Qubad Talabani, a member of the other faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).  A strong KRG within a  unified and federal Iraq is essential to its long-term stability and to the enduring defeat of ISIS,  she said, referring to the Islamic State militant group, whose destruction is a major U.S. policy objective in the region.  Disputes between the KRG and the Baghdad federal government range from the perennial tussle over how to share oil revenues to the control of territory and border crossings. Suggesting that Barzani s departure may yield greater Kurdish unity and improve the odds of a resolution with Baghdad, a U.S. official said:  We can t allow this tension to continue. They have to be able to find a way to live together. Now is the time to get them to sit down and try to work things out.  ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Saudi Arabia to let women enter sports stadiums in 2018,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will for the first time allow women to attend sports events, preparing special sections in three selected stadiums from early next year in another step toward opening public spaces to women. The stadiums in Jeddah, Dammam and Riyadh will be set up to accommodate families from early 2018, said the statement from the General Sports Authority, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency late on Sunday. Last month Saudi Arabia announced that, from June, women would be allowed to drive cars, ending the world s only ban on female driving. An economic and social reform program led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to open up cloistered lifestyles, shaped in part by a strict, conservative version of Sunni Islam that limits the role of women. Prince Mohammed also seeks to diversify the economy away from oil as part of his proposed reforms. The crown prince will be the first Saudi leader since 1953 to hail from a new generation when he inherits the throne; his father Salman is the sixth brother in a row to serve as king. The kingdom adheres to an austere Wahhabi brand of Sunni Islam, which bans gender mixing, concerts and cinemas. Women are required to receive permission from a male guardian to obtain passports or leave the country. Some of the social aspects of the reforms have been criticised by some clerics and Saudis on social media. Saudi authorities are also starting to reform areas once the exclusive domain of the clergy, such as education, courts and the law, and have promoted elements of national identity that have no religious component or pre-date Islam. Prince Mohammed told businessmen and reporters at a major investment forum last week that the country would cleave to a more open and tolerant interpretation of Islam.

Kenyan President Kenyatta wins 98 percent of vote in repeat election,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta won 98 percent of the vote in a repeated election in which an opposition boycott helped lower turnout to 39 percent, the electoral commission said on Monday. The announcement touched off small protests in a few opposition strongholds but also celebrations in pro-Kenyatta areas. Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga said the Oct. 26 election was a farce. Civil society groups also cited problems with the vote. The violence has for the most part seen protesters clash with police but some Kenyans fear it is starting to take on ethnic overtones after two deaths in clashes between rival groups at the weekend. At least 66 people have died in overall election violence. On Monday, the U.S. ambassador said Washington was  profoundly concerned  by the outbreaks of violence since the re-run. Kenya is east Africa s richest economy and a key security ally of the West against militant Islam. It also a key regional trade, logistics and trade hub. In his victory speech, Kenyatta repeated his belief that his victory in the original Aug. 8 election was legitimate and said dialogue would have to wait if the opposition was going to lodge court cases again. The Supreme Court nullified the Aug. 8 vote on procedural grounds.  My victory today is just part of a process that is likely to once again be subjected to a constitutional test through our courts ... I will submit to this constitutional path regardless of the outcome,  Kenyatta said.   Those who are going to ask me:  Are you going to engage in dialogue?  ... Let them (the opposition) first and foremost exhaust all their constitutional options.   Kenyatta took 98 percent of the vote, results from 266 out of 291 constituencies showed. The electoral commission said 7,616,217 valid votes were cast, representing 39 percent of the 19.6 million registered voters.  Protests by Odinga s supporters prevented polling stations from opening in 25 constituencies.  The election commission said poor security prevented voting in those areas but the final announcement could go ahead as it would not  materially affect  the result.  In the pro-Kenyatta area of Dagoretti North in Nairobi, cars honked and crowds of supporters in red T-shirts ran through the streets.   I m so happy the president has got his seat back,  said Peterson Njau.  Now the economy is going to lift up again.   Another resident, Kennedy Okeyo, said he cared more about football than politics but that ethnic clashes in his home this weekend had unnerved him.   You can t get to work, and even if you get to work, you can get attacked because of who you are,  he said.  But just down the road in Nairobi s Kawangware slum, around 100 youths listening to the results on mobile phones chanted  No Raila No Peace . They lit a bonfire in the middle of the street and began taunting riot police with cries of  the people want teargas .  Earlier, police dispersed protesters there with teargas when they tried to block a visit by Interior Minister Fred Matiang i. Another Nairobi shanty town, Mathare, the scene of deadly clashes between police and protesters immediately after the August vote, was largely calm although a handful of protesters lit a small fire.  And in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga s political heartland, around 50 youths began to block the road at the Kondele roundabout, the epicenter of protests, while others banged metal poles together. But the protest was small.   What can I do? They ve already announced it. Even if I burn tires, nothing will change,  said 25-year-old laborer Kennedy Omondi as he watched young men set a barricade alight.  Odinga pulled out of last week s vote, saying the electoral commission had failed to institute reforms to forestall the kind of  illegalities and irregularities  that scuppered Kenyatta s victory in the August election.  Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu, a coalition of civil society organizations with 2,000 election observers, said there were  multiple  cases where results from polling stations differed from results on the forms posted on the election portal after last week s vote.  In a report, they supplied a photo taken by their observers of the tally sheet for Bashaal market center in Garissa. It showed 133 votes for Kenyatta while the form displayed online showed 433 votes. Another form posted on the election website, from Tumbeni primary school in Kakamega, showed four votes for Odinga and two for another minor candidate but recorded the total number of votes cast was 77 votes cast.

"Russian-backed Syria congress may happen next month, focus on constitution: RIA","MOSCOW/ASTANA (Reuters) - A Moscow-backed congress of all Syria s ethnic groups may take place in Russia and begin working on a new constitution as early as next month, the news agency RIA reported on Monday, citing a source familiar with the situation. The congress, which President Vladimir Putin first mentioned earlier this month, may take place in mid-November at Russia s  Black Sea resort of Sochi, RIA said.

"Second woman enters Russian presidential race, campaigning for single mothers","MOSCOW (Reuters) - A journalist became the second woman to enter Russia s presidential race, saying on Monday she wanted to use the election to campaign for the rights of single mothers and children. The presidential election takes place in March next year. President Vladimir Putin is expected to stand and win, but has yet to confirm his plans. Some opposition activists believe the Kremlin s aim is to crown the field with candidates designed to distract and entertain in order to boost turnout and divide the liberal opposition.  The Kremlin denies that, saying anyone who meets the legal criteria to run can take part. On Monday, mother-of-two Ekaterina Gordon, 37, who has worked as a TV and radio talk show host, said she was putting herself forward as an independent presidential candidate. She said she had never voted, but had become disillusioned by both the liberal opposition and pro-Kremlin politicians.  I understood that everyone is fed from the same trough,  Gordon said in an online video.  There are many populist themes ... But there is one reality - we are a country of single mothers, and no one gives a damn about them.  She said she had not agreed her candidacy with the Kremlin and had experience of the kind of problems Russian woman faced due to her ownership of a law firm. Another female candidate, Russian TV personality Ksenia Sobchak, said earlier this month she planned to run for president, offering liberal voters unhappy with Putin s rule someone to back, though she, like Gordon, has little prospect of winning. Post-Soviet Russia has never had a female president.   Kremlin critic and opposition leader Alexei Navalny wants to run too, but Russia s central election commission has declared him ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence, which he says was politically-motivated.

Dutch begin trial over 1970s Ethiopian war crimes,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A man faced war crimes charges at a Dutch court on Monday accused of the incarceration, torture and murder of opponents of former Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in the 1970s.  As Mengistu s representative in the Ethiopian province of Gojjam, Eshetu Alemu is accused of ordering the killing of 75 young prisoners in 1978 and of being responsible for the incarceration and inhumane treatment of more than 200 people. The 63-year-old was born in Ethiopia and came to the Netherlands as an asylum seeker in 1990. He pleaded not guilty on Monday, stating that the prosecutors are accusing the wrong man. An Ethiopian court sentenced the defendant to death, in absentia, in 2007 for his role in what was called the  red terror , which the communist military junta of Mengistu conducted after the ousting of the Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie, in 1974, the national prosecutor s office said in a statement. The Ethiopian sentence, however, cannot be carried out in the Netherlands because it does not accept the death penalty, making a new trial the best option to hold him to account, prosecutors said.  The trial, which is based on an investigation by the International Crimes Team of the Dutch national police, is being heard at a Dutch domestic court in The Hague, rather than one of the international tribunals that sit in the city.      The court will this week question the defendant, who has been held in custody in the Netherlands since 2015, and will hear statements from victims - Ethiopians living abroad. It is not yet known when the court will reach a verdict. Mengistu was found guilty in absentia of genocide in the same trial in Ethiopia in 2007 after he and top members of his military government were accused of killing thousands during his 17-year rule.  Mengistu was ousted in 1991 and fled to Zimbabwe, where he still lives. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Technicolor Thailand is back after a black-clad mourning year for late king,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand officially ended a year of mourning for its late King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Monday, marking a return to colors for some after a monotone year during which many wore black from head-to-toe out of respect for their revered monarch. Hundreds of thousands of people thronged Bangkok s historic quarter to bid farewell last week to King Bhumibol, who died in October 2016. His $90 million-dollar funeral, full of pomp and ancient ritual, took place over five days. His remains were brought to their final resting place within Bangkok s Grand Palace on Sunday. Portraits of the bespectacled late king, who became a father figure for many during a seven-decade reign, were hung across Thailand. The black-and-white funeral bunting that had hung on the gates of Bangkok s Government House for a year was taken down on Monday and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha made a televised announcement to mark the official end of the mourning period.  The government would like to thank officials, both soldiers and civilians ... and the more than 10 million Thais who came to pay respects to the royal body over the past year,  Prayuth said. May Kanokwattana, 29, an office worker, wore bright yellow as she waited at the Siam BTS, a major Bangkok transport interchange.  I wore black for one year. I needed to show my sorrow. Today is the first day I am wearing a different color,  May told Reuters. She also wore a pin with the Thai number nine out of respect for King Bhumibol, who was also known as the ninth king of the Chakri Dynasty. Colors have a profound meaning for Thais. Astrological rules followed by many in the Southeast Asian nation assign a color to each day of the week. King Bhumibol was born on a Monday, a day associated with the color yellow. His only son, new King Maha Vajiralongkorn, was also born on a Monday. Some people shared charts on social media showing which colors would be considered luckiest to wear.  For confidence, health and power wear orange. For good support wear pale green,  said one chart. Pattinya Mankongwongcharoen, 49, an accountant wearing a peach-colored dress, said:  I won t continue wearing black because the mourning period is officially over and to do so would be disrespectful.  Others said they would continue to wear muted colors.  I m still grieving. I ll wear black or gray for a few more weeks,  said Pimsuda Chatree, 37, a shop owner. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
"Exclusive: Koran, boots and scarves all that remain in Philippine rebel leader's lair","MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Prayer mats, chequered scarves, black fatigues, and bullet-ridden walls mark the hideout where the  emir  of Islamic State in Southeast Asia spent months preparing the most brazen and devastating militant attack in the region. A four-storey house in a quiet alley of Marawi City in the southern Philippines was the secret lair of Isnilon Hapilon until late May. After a botched military raid to apprehend him, a thousand-strong rebel alliance held large parts of the city for five months. Hapilon s death in a military operation elsewhere in Marawi on Oct. 16 was the catalyst for the end of Philippines  longest and most intense urban battle in recent history.   Security forces moved in on the house on May 23, trying to capture the country s most wanted man, but came under sustained attack from rebels firing rocket-propelled grenades.  A bomb-battered structure, shattered windows and wall-to-wall holes from machine gun fire tell the story of the ferociousthree-day battle that erupted at Hapilon s hideout, and promptedthe call to hundreds of fighters to expedite the plannedtakeover of Marawi. Hapilon escaped through a large hole that was blasted out of a rear wall, making his way across a rice field to a mosque next to the vast Lake Lanao. From there, he joined the guerrillas. Community volunteers on Thursday showed Reuters the house in the now empty, narrow street where the military believes Hapilon had lain low for several months. All other properties were intact and neighbors had fled long ago.  At the time, no one knew who these people were. People saw them about but there was no reason to suspect anything,  said Mohammed Seddick Raki, who lived nearby. Other volunteers said women and children stayed at the rented house and visitors were frequent. Children s shoes were scattered amid the debris and a woman s robe was hanging from a window. Inside the house, black shirts, pants and plaid scarves synonymous with Islamic State were strewn across rooms littered with broken floor tiles and chunks of rock from blasted walls. Left behind were waterproof boots, a balaclava, medical supplies and camouflage bags and waistcoats typically used by soldiers to carry rifle magazines. Coated in a think layer of dust on floors of every room were pocket-sized copies of the Koran, some with pages stained by water leaked through gaping holes in the roof. A mosque, about 100 meters behind the house, was the venue for an annual gathering in Marawi of Tablighi Jamaat, a Sunni missionary movement, just days before the fighting erupted. Military officials say the foreigners who fought in Hapilon s alliance - among them Indonesians, Malaysians and some from Arab states - had used that event as a cover to slip into Marawi without raising suspicion.  The deputy task force commander in Marawi, Colonel Romeo Brawner, said Hapilon evaded security forces because rebels had a network of lookouts and gunmen ready to defend him.  They put up heavy resistance. They were spread across a large area. They were strategically placed,  he said.  They were prepared for it.  Hapilon s escape in the last week of May led to anarchy in the city of about 200,000. Rebels took hostages, set fire to buildings, ransacked churches, broke into the local jail to free inmates and looted an armory. The government had insufficient security forces in Marawi to prevent the fighters from fanning out across the city and seizing hundreds of buildings.  Hapilon was wanted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and had a bounty on his head of up to $5 million. He was killed by army rangers in a night operation and his body was retrieved from the battle zone in the heart of the city. His identity was confirmed by the FBI s DNA analysis. The city of Marawi was all but destroyed by government air strikes and shelling that leveled commercial areas and crushed thousands of shops, homes and vehicles.    No one could have known what would happen,  said Mohamed Faisal Mama, a resident in the same Basak Malutlot district where Hapilon was hiding.  No one knew them. They weren t famous then.

Suspected Boko Haram raid kills at least 10 in Cameroon village,"YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Suspected Boko Haram militants killed at least 10 villagers in northern Cameroon on Sunday night in what army and local officials said was revenge for attacks by Cameroon s army.  Cameroon s semi-arid Far North region has been a target of Boko Haram suicide bombings and raids for eight years as the Islamist insurgency spilled over the border from Nigeria, killing 20,000 and uprooting nearly 3 million in the Lake Chad region. Cameroon forces have tried to beat back insurgents but have struggled to stop unpredictable attacks that have been the hallmark of Boko Haram s bid to carve out an Islamic state.   A senior army source said the attackers came to the village of Gouderi at 11 p.m. on Sunday and killed 11 people. Two local officials told Reuters by phone that  about 10  had been killed.   It looks like revenge because the army killed Boko Haram members in this village and forced others to retreat to Nigeria,  the army source said.  ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1

Japan pledges to help Philippines rebuild Marawi,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said on Monday it will help the Philippines rebuild  conflict-torn southern Marawi city as well as other infrastructure in a deepening of ties to counter China s regional influence. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made the pledges in a joint statement with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte following talks in Tokyo.  Duterte on Oct 23 announced the end of five months of military operations in Marawi held by Islamic State rebels in a conflict that destroyed much of the city s center and displaced some 300,000 people.    The Government of Japan recognizes that rehabilitation and reconstruction of the City of Marawi and is extremely important,  the statement said. Japan also offered to help with other projects ranging from rail infrastructure to river defenses including a possible 600 billion yen loan to help fund development of a subway in Manila.   The meeting was an opportunity for Abe to discuss security in Asia ahead of key regional meetings beginning with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering in Vietnam in November.  I confirmed with President Duterte that we are both maritime nations sharing basic values and strategic interests,  Abe said during his joint announcement with Duterte. The two countries, he added, would address common issues including North Korea and  a free and open Indo-Pacific.     Japan is concerned about China s growing power in the South China Sea and sees cooperation with the Philippines, which lies on the waterway s eastern side, as key ally in helping prevent Beijing s influence spreading into the western Pacific.  Duterte, unlike his predecessor, Benigno Aquino, has been less critical of Beijing s island building in the South China Sea. The Philippine leader will return home on Tuesday after an audience with the Japanese Emperor.     Abe and Duterte will travel to Vietnam for the two-day APEC meeting from Nov 11, which U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend.  Leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other countries in the region will meet again in the Philippines after the APEC gathering for the East Asia Summit and a gathering of ASEAN that will be chaired by Philippine s president.  Duterte in his statement in Tokyo did not mention China, instead calling North Korea to halt its ballistic missile and nuclear test and return to talks with the U.S. Japan and other countries.

"Singapore bans two Muslim preachers, citing divisive views","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has banned two Muslim foreign preachers from entering the city-state because their views bred intolerance and were a risk to its social harmony, the government said on Monday. The decision to block Ismail Menk, identified by local media as a Zimbabwean and Haslin bin Baharim as a Malaysian, is the latest move by the Singaporean authorities to put a curb on individuals from spreading divisive views. Menk has preached Muslims are not allowed to greet people of other faiths on their religious festivals, Singapore s home affairs ministry said in a statement.  It accused Baharim of holding views that promote discord between Muslims and non-Muslims, whom he described as  deviant.   (Their views) are unacceptable in the context of Singapore s multi-racial and multi-religious society,  the ministry said.  Reuters was not in a position to reach out to the pair. Singapore is predominantly Chinese, many of whom follow Buddhism and Taoism but 14 percent of the population is Muslim and nearly 19 percent Christian.   Authorities in the city-state, an outpost of stability in a region where religious tension is not uncommon, are sensitive to public remarks they deem might adversely affect religious and social harmony. Over the past few years, Singapore increased its level of surveillance for Islamist radicalism as concern grew about the spread of Islamic State in the region. Menk and Baharim planned to conduct religious sessions on a ship departing from Singapore next month after their applications for short-term work passes to preach in Singapore were turned down, the government said.     They will not be allowed to get around the ban by preaching instead on cruise ships which operate to and from Singapore,  the home ministry said. Last month, authorities said they rejected applications for two foreign Christian preachers to speak in Singapore as they had made  denigrating and inflammatory comments of other religions.

Iran fulfilling nuclear deal commitments: IAEA chief,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Iran is fulfilling its commitments under the nuclear deal with world powers and U.N. inspectors are facing no problems in their verification efforts, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director-general said on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he would not continue to certify the multinational 2015 agreement, reached under his predecessor Barack Obama, and warned that he might ultimately terminate it. Iran would abandon the agreement if it were deemed not be serving its national interests, President Hassan Rouhani said in reaction to Trump s decision. But he also said,  No president can revoke an international deal...(and) Iran will continue to honour its commitments under the deal.  The other parties to the accord - Britain, Germany, France, Russia, China and the European Union have all reaffirmed their commitment to it and urged the United States not to back out. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, whose inspectors are tasked with monitoring compliance with the deal, reiterated that Iran was adhering to it.   The IAEA can state that such nuclear-related commitments are being implemented,  Amano told a news conference in Abu Dhabi following a trip to Iran on Sunday where he met with Rouhani and other officials.  I requested that Iran ... fully implement the nuclear-related commitments. This (was) the main thrust of the meeting in Iran ... Regarding the activities of our inspectors, they are discharging their responsibility without problem,  he said. Under the agreement, Iran undertook to restrict its nuclear programme to help ensure it could not be put to developing atomic bombs in exchange for the lifting of trade and financial sanctions that had hobbled its oil-based economy. Amano added that he had told Iranian officials the nuclear deal was a  significant gain for verification . Speaking on the sidelines of an international conference on nuclear power in the United Arab Emirates, Amano declined comment on U.S. policy towards Iran and on Iran s absence from the meeting, which draws together IAEA member states.

"Somalia's capital restricts movement of trucks, tankers after attacks","MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somali authorities imposed a daytime ban on Monday on the movement of large trucks and road tankers inside the capital Mogadishu in an attempt to improve security following a wave of devastating attacks by militants. The move followed twin truck bombings on Oct. 15 that killed more than 350 people in the city, in the deadliest attack in the history of the Horn of Africa nation. Though the Islamist militant group al Shabaab did not claim responsibility for that attack, the method is one it has often used.  Trucks and tankers cannot pass ... from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm. This is to ensure security and (to offer) a solution to the complaints of the public,  Tabid Abdi, the capital s mayor, said in a statement.  Any truck or tanker driver who does not comply will be fined $1,000.   Further underlining the Somali capital s security woes, at least 29 people were killed on Sunday during a 12-hour siege at a Mogadishu hotel, in an attack claimed by al Shabaab. The government sacked two top security officials.  They had the uniforms of security forces, even though they did not have ID cards,  Information Minister Abdirahman Omar Osman told Reuters. Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. Al Shabaab aims to topple the government in Mogadishu and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. The country has been at war since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other. Though it has lost large swathes of territory to African Union peacekeepers, the group s attacks have grown in frequency and size, as a 22,000-strong peacekeeping force prepares to begin withdrawing.

Iran to lift border curbs with Iraq's Kurdish region in coming days,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran will reopen all its border crossings with Iraq s Kurdistan region in the coming days, lifting restrictions imposed after last month s Kurdish vote in favor of independence, its chief of staff said on Monday. The announcement comes a day after Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said he would give up his position as president on Nov. 1, after the independence referendum he championed backfired and triggered military action by the Baghdad. After the vote, Iraqi troops were ordered by the country s prime minister Haider al-Abadi to take control of areas claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurdish government. Iran, which has its own Kurdish minority, also opposes independence for Iraqi Kurds, and at the request of Baghdad   closed its borders with the Kurdish region in northern Iraq and halted all flights there and back.

China signals will again block Indian bid to blacklist militant leader,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday signaled it would again block an Indian request at the United Nations to blacklist the head of a Pakistan-based militant group because there was no consensus, a move likely to cause recrimination in New Delhi. India, backed by the United States, has been trying to get Maulana Masood Azhar on a U.N. list of groups with ties to Al Qaeda, blaming his group for a series of attacks in India,  including one on its parliament in 2002 and another last year on an airbase.  But China, a member of the U.N. Security Council, has repeatedly put a technical hold on the Indian request, the latest of which is due to end this week.  Such decisions must be based on cast-iron evidence and fully backed by members of the U.N. panel charged with implementing resolutions relating to sanctions on militant groups and individuals, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.  China proposed a technical hold, the aim of which was to give more time for the committee members to discuss it and for relevant parties to have further consultations,  Hua told a daily news briefing.  But regrettably, the committee has yet to reach consensus.   The wrangling over Masood Azhar, a longtime Indian foe, has become a thorny issue in ties between China and India, which fears Beijing is disregarding its concerns over terrorism.  It has also fueled worries that China will stick to its  all-weather  friend, India s arch-foe Pakistan, no matter the weight of evidence against Islamabad.  Pakistan denies giving material support to militants fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir besides carrying out attacks elsewhere.  It said it interrogated Azhar and his associates in the Jaish-e-Mohammad group after the January 2016 attack on the Pathankot air base but found no evidence linking him to it. Hua said there were clear rules for listing a person or group as a terrorist, and that China has always believed the relevant U.N. committee should operate on the principles of objectivity, fairness and professionalism on this matter. Jaish-e-Mohammad has already been blacklisted by the 15-nation Security Council, but not Azhar, an Islamist hardliner. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1

Croatia wants to adopt euro within 7-8 years: prime minister,"ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia aims to become a euro zone member within the next seven to eight years, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said on Monday.  We don t want to specify the exact dates, but we want Croatia to become a euro zone member within two government terms in office,  Plenkovic told an economic conference devoted to the introduction of the euro in Croatia. The centre-right government came to power a year ago. Plenkovic said Croatia wanted to enter the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM-2) within the next three years, before the country takes the presidency of the European Union in 2020. EU members that have not yet adopted the euro are expected to participate for at least two years in ERM II, a mechanism aimed to ensure currency stability before joining the euro zone. The Croatian central bank already keeps Croatia s kuna currency in a narrow fluctuation band, roughly at between 7.3 and 7.7 to the euro, occasionally intervening on the local foreign exchange market mostly to ease appreciation pressures. Croatia s major challenge before adopting the euro is expected to be the reduction of public debt which is slightly above 80 percent of gross domestic product.  Our goal is to reduce the public debt to 72 percent of GDP by 2020 ... We are undertaking a major fiscal consolidation and this year the budget gap will be even lower than last year s 0.9 percent of GDP,  Plenkovic said. Central Bank Governor Boris Vujcic said Croatia was the most  euroised  EU country of those that had not yet adopted the euro.  Some 75 percent of local deposits and 67 percent of local debt is denominated in the euro. Some 60 percent of Croatia s trade exchange is related to the euro zone, while 70 percent of tourism receipts comes from the euro zone countries,  Vujcic told the conference. The most important benefits of euro adoption would be the removal of currency risk and lower interest rates, he said. Croatia took an obligation to adopt the euro when it joined the EU in 2013, but without a defined timetable. Vujcic said any fears among the population about prices soaring when the euro is adopted could be tackled by an obligation to display prices in both kunas and euros six months before an agreed euro zone entry date.

China urges closer cooperation with Sri Lanka on key projects,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China and Sri Lanka should focus on strengthening cooperation over key investment projects, Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday told his visiting counterpart from Sri Lanka, amid strong local opposition to some major Chinese-invested schemes. In July, Sri Lanka signed a long-delayed $1.1 billion deal to lease its southern Hambantota port to China, ignoring an appeal by opposition parties to debate the pact in parliament. The $1.5-billion port, close to the main shipping route from Asia to Europe and likely to play a key role in China s  Belt and Road  initiative, has been mired in controversy since a Chinese firm agreed to take an 80 percent stake in it. The pact signed last year sparked widespread public anger, as Chinese control of the port, which included a plan for a 99-year lease of 15,000 acres (23 sq miles) to develop an adjacent industrial zone, provoked fears it could be used by Chinese naval vessels. Meeting in Beijing, Wang told Tilak Marapana that the two countries should take this year s 60th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties as an opportunity, China s foreign ministry said in a statement. Both should  emphasize strengthening traditional friendship and political mutual trust, major infrastructure projects, investment and trade  to  upgrade  their relationship, Wang added. The short statement did not mention any specific projects. As one of the first countries to help in Sri Lanka s post-war reconstruction after the 2009 end of its 26-year civil war, China s ties with Sri Lanka have unnerved India, traditionally the island nation s most important partner.     By 2014, Chinese navy submarines were also docking in Colombo, raising alarm in New Delhi and prompting a push by the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to claw back influence in the region.

Philippines police chief hints at possible run for presidency,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines  top police chief who oversaw a bloody war on drugs that has killed thousands of Filipinos hinted on Monday at a possible run for the presidency. Ronald dela Rosa, a stocky, celebrity-like general nicknamed  Bato  (Rock), who retires in 2018, has flagged his political ambitions, saying he was open to running for the Senate. But in a speech after a flag raising ceremony at police headquarters, Dela Rosa for the first time publicly suggested he may have his sights set on higher political goals.  Wait for Bato to become president and I will quadruple your salaries,  Dela Rosa told his men as he denied rumors he would leave retirees out of planned salary increases. Dela Rosa is among those touted by the national media as Duterte s possible successor in 2022, along with world boxing champion and senator Manny Pacquiao, and the son and namesake of late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos.  Dela Rosa has acted as the enforcer for the firebrand leader s war on drugs which had led to more than 3,900 people killed in 16 months. The campaign has sparked outrage abroad, but domestic polls have shown crime-weary Filipinos are largely supportive of the measure.  Duterte ordered the police this month to halt activities in the war on drugs and leave all operations to drug enforcement agency, amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct. Police reject allegations by activists they are executing suspected drug users and dealers, saying victims in their anti-narcotics operations were killed because they were armed and had violently resisted arrest.

Syrian hostages who escaped Islamic State receive rapturous homecoming,"Qaryatayn, SYRIA (Reuters) - Twenty six Syrian hostages who escaped from their Islamic State captors received an emotional homecoming on Sunday in the central province of Homs, witnesses and officials said.   They were among at least 70 people abducted and taken by fleeing Islamic State militants to a secret location in the desert east of the town of al-Qaryatayn on Oct. 21 when the Syrian army and pro-government militias regained control of the town.  The others are still missing, according to local officials, who have not disclosed the identities of any of the hostages.   Al-Qaryatayn lies nearly 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of Deir al-Zor city, the current focus of the Syrian government s offensive, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, against Islamic State. About 200 people turned out in al-Qaryatayn on Sunday to welcome home the returning hostages, according to Reuters reporters who visited the war-scarred town during a trip organized by the Syrian authorities. Parents wept as they embraced returning sons while other relatives and local residents threw sweets and sugar in the air in celebration.   Thank God for your return,  said an elderly man as he embraced a young man. Most in the crowd declined to be interviewed.  Syrian authorities said jihadists had taken revenge after being forced out after three weeks of fighting around the outskirts of al-Qaryatayn, by slaughtering scores of the city s inhabitants. A senior local official said the hostages escaped after they got past an Iraqi jihadist militant while he took a nap and seized his gun and shot him dead. But the joy surrounding the hostages  return was still overshadowed by executions witnessed in the town in the past few weeks when militants rounded up local officials and members of the security forces, police and members of their families and executed them in broad daylight, according to officials.    We forgot our joy when thinking of the nightmare that we went through,  Found Ghosn, a local government official told Reuters TV, saying city officials had identified at least 70 out of 130 people slain during the revenge killings.

Kurdish leader Barzani resigns after independence vote backfires,"ERBIL/BAGHDAD Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said he would give up his position as president on Nov. 1, after an independence referendum he championed backfired and triggered a regional crisis.  There was high drama at the Kurdish parliament, which was stormed by armed protesters as it met to approve the veteran leader s resignation as Kurdish president. Some MPs were barricaded in their offices on Sunday evening.     In a televised address, his first since Iraqi forces launched a surprise offensive to recapture Kurdish-held territory on Oct. 16, Barzani confirmed that he would not extend his presidential term after Nov. 1  under any conditions .  I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence,  said Barzani, who has campaigned for Kurdish self-determination for nearly four decades.  The address followed a letter he sent to parliament in which he asked members to take measures to fill the resulting power vacuum. The region s parliament met in the Kurdish capital Erbil on Sunday to discuss the letter. A majority of 70 Kurdish MPs voted to accept Barzani s request and 23 opposed it, Kurdish TV channels Rudaw and Kurdistan 24 said.  Demonstrators, some carrying clubs and guns, stormed the parliament building as the session was in progress. Gunshots were heard. Some protesters outside the building said they wanted to  punish  MPs who they said had  insulted  Barzani. Some attacked journalists at the scene. A Kurdish official had told Reuters on Saturday that Barzani had decided to hand over the presidency without waiting for elections that had been set for Nov. 1 but which have now been delayed by eight months. The region, which had enjoyed unprecedented autonomy for years, has been in turmoil since the independence referendum a month ago prompted military and economic retaliation from Iraq s central government in Baghdad. In his address, Barzani vigorously defended his decision to hold the Sept. 25 referendum, the results of which  can never be erased , he said. The vote was overwhelmingly for independence and triggered the military action by the Baghdad government and threats from neighboring Turkey and Iran.  He added that the Iraqi attack on Kirkuk and other Kurdish held territory vindicated his position that Baghdad no longer believed in federalism and instead wanted to curtail Kurdish rights.  Barzani condemned the United States for failing to back the Kurds.  We tried to stop bloodshed but the Iraqi forces and Popular Mobilization Front (Shi ite militias) kept advancing, using U.S. weapons,  he said.   Our people should now question, whether the U.S. was aware of Iraq s attack and why they did not prevent it.  Asked for reaction to Barzani s resignation, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said:  I would refer you to Kurdistan officials for information on President Barzani. Also, we are not going to get into any private diplomatic discussions.  Barzani has been criticized by Kurdish opponents for the loss of the city of Kirkuk, oil-rich and considered by many Kurds to be their spiritual home. His resignation could help facilitate a reconciliation between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Iraq s central government, whose retaliatory measures since the referendum have transformed the balance of power in the north.  Barzani has led the KRG since it was established in 2005. His second term expired in 2013 but was extended without elections being held as Islamic State militants swept across vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.     U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State but the alliance has faltered since the militants were largely defeated in the country.  After the Kurdish vote, Iraqi troops were ordered by the country s prime minister Haider al-Abadi to take control of areas claimed by both Baghdad and the KRG.  Abadi also wants to take control of the border crossings between the Kurdish region and Turkey, Iran and Syria, including one through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil. The fall of Kirkuk - a multi-ethnic city which lies outside the KRG s official boundaries - to Iraqi forces on Oct. 16 was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurds  independence drive because it halved the region s oil export revenue. Iraqi forces and the Peshmerga started a second round of talks on Sunday to resolve a conflict over control of the Kurdistan region s border crossings, Iraqi state TV said.  A first round was held on Friday and Saturday, with Abadi ordering a 24-hour suspension on Friday of military operations against Kurdish forces. He demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks, saying in a statement:  We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution.

China reiterates support for Spanish government amid Catalonia crisis,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China understands the Spanish government s efforts to protect national unity and opposes any actions to split the country, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday, after the Catalan parliament voted to unilaterally declare independence last week. China generally takes a dim view of independence or secessionist movements around the world, while saying it adheres to a policy of non-interference in other nations  internal affairs.  On Friday, Spain s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy assumed direct control of the Catalan region, sacked its secessionist government and called a snap election for Dec. 21. China s position on the issue was clear and consistent, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, reiterating support previously offered to the Spanish government.  We think this is an internal affair for Spain, and understand and support the Spanish government s efforts to protect national and ethnic unity and territorial integrity, and oppose actions to split the country and damage the rule of law,  she told a daily news briefing on Monday.   We believe that Spain has the ability to protect social order and guarantee citizens  rights under the framework of the law.   Beijing has expressed more openness to independence votes agreed by both sides, such as Scotland s unsuccessful 2014 referendum to leave the United Kingdom, and South Sudan s 2011 vote in favor of independence from Sudan. At home, China contends with what it says are separatist movements in its western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, and also claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as a wayward province.

Factbox: Catalonia crisis: What's next?,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain on Friday sacked Catalonia s regional government, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for Dec. 21, in a bid to draw a line under the country s worst political crisis in 40 years. Below are several scenarios of what could happen in the next few days. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia s government including regional president Carles Puigdemont and his deputy Oriol Junqueras and assumed direct control over the region. Central government ministries assumed the powers of the Catalan administration until a regional election takes place on Dec. 21. It is not clear whether a snap regional election will resolve the crisis. An opinion poll published by El Mundo on Sunday showed that pro-independence parties may lose their parliamentary majority and even arrive behind anti-independence forces. The vote could result into a hung parliament. Other opinion polls have also shown Catalonia is almost evenly split between pro- and anti-independence supporters. Catalonia s main secessionist groups have called for widespread civil disobedience. They also instructed civil servants not to obey orders from Madrid and respond with peaceful resistance. It is unclear whether such calls will be followed or not. A key test will be when 200,000 civil servants return to work on Monday. [L8N1N40ZQ] Spain s government said it was not planning to make any arrests, but it is unclear how it will proceed if the current regional administration staff refuse to leave their offices. None of the immediate Catalan cabinet, including Puigdemont, are thought to have spent the weekend in the Barcelona central offices and it is unclear if they will attempt to return to work on Monday. A growing number of analysts have feared this could lead to a physical confrontation if national police, who used heavy-handed tactics to thwart an Oct. 1 vote on independence, seek to intervene. One of the main problems over the implementation of direct rule will relate to Catalonia s own police forces, the Mossos d Esquadra. On Saturday, the Mossos chief Josep Lluis Trapero was fired. The new chief told officers they should remain neutral. In an open letter on Sunday, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido praised the Mossos for their work and urged them to accept temporary direction from Madrid. But a group of Mossos favoring independence had previously said they would not follow instructions from the central government and would not use force to remove ministers and lawmakers from power. Several officers told Reuters they believed the 17,000-strong force was split between those who want independence and those who oppose it. The Mossos, whose former chief is under investigation on suspicion of sedition, will have to act on direct orders from their new bosses. If deemed necessary, Mossos officers may be replaced by national police. The economy and budget ministries took full control over regional finances on Friday. Many companies have however said on condition of anonymity that they feared a new Catalan treasury could start levying taxes, and that they would seek to move their tax base outside Catalonia. It is also possible that some pro-independence Catalans will stop paying their taxes to the Spanish treasury. The Spanish government had initially said it would control widely watched Catalan public television TV3, but it eventually dropped that plan. The media is likely to play an important role in the run-up to the new election in Catalonia. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
Rheinmetall CEO says Turkey row holding up defense projects: DPA,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tensions between Germany and Turkey are holding up planned defense projects at Rheinmetall, the German company s chief executive told news agency DPA in an interview. Ties between the two NATO allies have been strained by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s crackdown on opponents after a failed coup last year as well as Germany s refusal to extradite people Turkey says were involved in the plot. Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger said in the interview published on Monday that several projects, including the production of ammunition for fighter jets in Turkey and upgrades to Turkey s Leopard tanks, were still awaiting decisions by the two governments.  If relations with Turkey don t improve it will be difficult to obtain clearance from Germany,  he said. Poor relations have also dimmed Rheinmetall s prospects for playing a role in Turkey s Altay tank project, worth an estimated 7 billion euros ($8.13 billion), DPA said. Turkey s BMC, with which Rheinmetall has a joint venture in Turkey, is among the bidders for the first tranche to build around 100 to 200 of a planned 1,000 combat tanks, DPA said. If BMC wins the contract, Rheinmetall could in theory take part in the development of the tank via joint venture RBSS, in which the German company holds a 40 percent stake, but it would need an export clearance from the German government. Papperger said Rheinmetall had no plans to build its own tank factory in Turkey. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1

"Hundreds of thousands march for unified Spain, poll shows depths of division","BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain filled Barcelona s streets on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence. Political parties opposing a split by Catalonia from Spain had a small lead in an opinion poll published on Sunday, the first since Madrid called a regional election to try to resolve the country s worst political crisis in four decades. Polls and recent elections have shown that about half the electorate in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, oppose secession from Spain, but a vocal independence movement has brought the current crisis to a head.  Spain s central government called an election for Dec. 21 on Friday after sacking Catalonia s president Carles Puigdemont, dissolving its parliament and dismissing its government. That followed the assembly s unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by three national parties. The regional government claimed it had a mandate to push ahead with independence following an unofficial referendum on Oct. 1 which was ruled illegal under Spanish law and mostly boycotted by unionists.  Waving thousands of Spanish flags and singing  Viva Espa a , protesters on Sunday turned out in the largest display of support for a united Spain since the beginning of the crisis   underlining the depth of division in Catalonia itself.  I m here to defend Spanish unity and the law,  said Alfonso Machado, 55, a salesman standing with a little girl with Spanish flags in her hair.   Knowing that in the end there won t be independence, I feel sorry for all the people tricked into thinking there could be and the divisions they ve driven through Catalan society.   The poll of 1,000 people by Sigma Dos for newspaper El Mundo showed unionist parties winning 43.4 percent support and pro-independence parties 42.5 percent.  The survey was taken from Monday to Thursday, just as the central government prepared to take control of Catalonia. Madrid said on Saturday that secessionist politicians, including Puigdemont, were free to take part in the election. The hardline CUP has been unclear if it would. The deposed Catalan government will soon have to make difficult decisions, Puigdemont s former deputy Oriol Junqueras said on Sunday in an editorial in online newspaper El Punt Avui. He stopped short of saying his ERC party would take part in the election.   We need a shared strategy ... it s important to weave solid alliances with those who are willing to build a state that serves its citizens,  he said, possibly alluding to a rumored alliance between the ERC and the Catalan arm of the anti-austerity Podemos party. Such an alliance could put the independence movement in difficult position as it would mean a main secession supporter joining forces with parties that reject Madrid s hard line but do not support separatism.         With weeks to go before the election, the poll showed the CUP, kingmaker for the pro-secessionists in the dismissed 135-seat parliament, would win seven seats, down from a current 10.  The pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si, which held 62 seats previously, was split into parties PDeCat and ERC for the poll as they are unlikely to run on a single platform. The two would win between 54 and 58 seats in total, the poll showed. At Sunday s rally, former European Parliament president Josep Borrell called for unionist voters to turn out in December to ensure independence supporters lose their stranglehold on the regional parliament.  Maybe we re here because many of us during elections didn t go and vote. Now we have a golden opportunity. This time, nobody should stay at home,  Borrell said to cheering crowds. Puigdemont called on Saturday for peaceful opposition to Madrid s takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as Spanish authorities move into Barcelona to enforce control. European countries, the United States and Mexico have also rejected the Catalan declaration of independence and expressed support for Spain s unity. But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule and putting officials in administrative roles. National police were accused of heavy-handedness during the Oct. 1 referendum.  Officers of the regional police force, called the Mossos d Esquadra in Catalan, were stationed in main public and government buildings on Sunday. But the force is believed to have divided loyalties. The central government has removed the Mossos  chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, and said units could be replaced if warranted. In an open letter on Sunday, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido praised the Mossos for their work and urged them to accept temporary direction from Madrid.  The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the central  government and to mount  peaceful resistance , while the pro-independence trade union CSC has called a strike. Puigdemont, Junqueras and their advisors left the Catalan government offices on Friday, newspaper La Vanguardia reported on Sunday, effectively handing the building over to Madrid and making a forced eviction on Monday less likely. Since the return of democracy in the late 1970s Spain has suffered several traumatic episodes, including an attempted military coup in 1981, a violent Basque separatist conflict, and more recently an economic crisis. The Catalan issue is however the biggest challenge to the territorial integrity of what is now a progressive European Union nation. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism to Barcelona has been hit and markets have darted up and down on the fast-moving developments. European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Qatar emir says open to Trump-hosted talks over Gulf crisis: CBS,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar s ruler said he is ready for U.S.-hosted direct talks aimed at solving the worst diplomatic crisis in the Gulf in years but has yet to hear a response to U.S. President Donald Trump s invitation to the four Arab states boycotting Doha. Speaking to U.S. broadcaster CBS News, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said he wanted an end to the dispute, which erupted on June 5 and pits Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt against Qatar.  Nothing is going to be above our dignity, our sovereignty. But we want it to end. I always say that,  he told the  60 Minutes  program in an interview aired on Sunday.  If they (are) going to walk one meter toward me, I m willing to walk 10,000 miles towards them,  he said. The four countries have cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar, the world s top seller of liquefied natural gas, accusing it of financing terrorism. Doha denies the charges. The dispute has hit travel and food imports and ratcheted up tensions in a wealthy region which plays a leading role in global energy markets as well as events across the wider Middle East.  On Sunday, Bahrain s foreign minister called for freezing Qatar s membership out of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to preserve its unity, adding that Bahrain will not attend the upcoming GCC summit if Qatar does not change its stand. Qatar hosts Al Udeid air base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East. Sheikh Tamim said Trump had told him  I will not accept my friends fighting amongst themselves,  and that in talks on the sidelines of a United Nations  meeting in September he had made an offer to host talks in the United States.  I told him straightaway,  Mr President, we are very ready. I ve been asking for dialogue from day one,  Sheikh Tamim said, adding that the meeting was supposed to happen very soon and that he had not heard a response from the other countries. Trump, who has said he would be willing to mediate in the dispute, said in September he had a  very strong feeling  it would be solved  pretty quickly . Earlier in September, Saudi Arabia suspended any dialogue with Qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts,  just after a report of a phone call between the leaders of the two countries suggested a possible breakthrough in the dispute. Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman spoke by  phone with Qatar s emir on Sept. 8 in the first publicly reported contact between the two leaders since the crisis began. There has been no further contact reported since then. In the CBS interview, Sheikh Tamim reiterated that Qatar would not close down the Doha-based Al Jazeera television network, as demanded by the four countries who accuse the broadcaster of bias and interfering in their affairs. Al Jazeera says it is an independent news service giving a voice to everyone in the region. Sheikh Tamim also said he feared for the region if any military actions were taken as part of the crisis.  I m fearful that if anything happens, if any military act happens, this region will be in chaos,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
"Taiwan to boost defense spending, U.S. concerned over possible military imbalance: official media","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan will increase future defense spending by two percent each year, President Tsai Ing-wen said during a visit to Hawaii where the United States expressed concern over a possible military imbalance in the Taiwan Straits, Taiwan media reported. In the event that Taiwan purchases arms from a foreign military, the island s defense spending could increase as much as three percent each year, and could possibly increase further using a special budget if  significant purchase cases  are made, Tsai said in remarks carried by official media on Monday.  Tsai made the comments in response to U.S. concerns about a possible military imbalance in the Taiwan Strait expressed by Ambassador James Moriarty during a meeting. Tsai did not elaborate on when the increased defense spending would start.    Tsai s comments were reflected by National Security Council deputy secretary-general Tsai Ming-yen, who recounted to official media the conversation between Tsai and Moriarty, who is chairman of the U.S. Mission in Taiwan, about expanding Taiwan s national defense policy.  Moriarty had expressed concern about China s double-digit growth in defense investments in the last few years, and that Taiwan would need to address a possible military imbalance over the Taiwan Strait, deputy secretary-general Tsai recounted.    President Tsai in turn replied Taiwan would develop a comprehensive plan in accordance with strategic needs, short-term needs, and long-term plans, to create defense forces on the island that would have  reliable combat effectiveness . Tsai visited Hawaii at the weekend on her way to three of Taiwan s diplomatic allies in the Pacific, despite China, which considers Taiwan a wayward province, calling on the United States to stop the trip. Her trip comes about a week before U.S. President Donald Trump visits Asia. China has increased pressure on Taiwan since Tsai took office last year, suspecting she wants to push for formal independence. China has conducted more military drills around Taiwan and peeled away its few remaining diplomatic allies. Tsai described Taiwan-U.S. relations as being  unprecedentedly friendly  in comments released by Taiwan s presidential office on Monday.  We are happy to see U.S. promises of peace and stability for the Asia-Pacific region, and from meetings with the United States understand the necessity to increase investment in defense,  it quoted her as saying. The United States and Taiwan have not had formal diplomatic relations since Washington established ties with Beijing in 1979, but the United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. Taiwan is well armed with mostly U.S.-made weapons but has been pushing for sales of more advanced equipment, such as fighter jets, to deal with what Taipei sees as a growing threat from China and its own rapidly modernizing armed forces. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. It regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States and has been upset by U.S. moves to expand military exchanges with Taiwan and continued U.S. arms sales to the island. Tsai s stopover in Hawaii included a tour of a Pearl Harbor memorial, a banquet with the overseas Taiwan community, and joint speeches with Moriarty, the chairman of the U.S. Mission in Taiwan, also known as the American Institute in Taiwan.  It was her second U.S. visit this year. In January, Tsai stopped in Houston and San Francisco on her way to and from Latin America.  Tsai moves on to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and the Solomon Islands from Monday during a week-long trip and will stop over in the U.S. territory of Guam on her way back to Taiwan.

Saudi Arabian Airlines resumes flying to Iraq after 27 years,"DUBAI (Reuters) - State-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines said it will start flying regularly to Iraq on Monday after a 27-year halt, state news agency SPA said. The carrier s director general, Saleh bin Nasser al-Jasser, will accompany reporters and passengers on the first flight to depart from the Saudi city of Jeddah to Baghdad, SPA said late on Sunday. There have been no flights between Saudi Arabia and Iraq since former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are both wooing Baghdad in an effort to halt the growing regional influence of arch-foe Iran. In August the two countries said they planned to open the Arar land border crossing for trade for the first time since 1990. That announcement followed a decision by the Saudi cabinet this month to set up a joint trade commission with Iraq. Saudi Arabian budget airline Flynas was the first Saudi airline to fly to Iraq in more than 25 years. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1

Expulsion of Australian ministers cast doubt over more than 100 government decisions: opposition Labor,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s main Labor opposition party said on Monday it was considering a legal challenge to more than 100 decisions made by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s conservative government, after two of his cabinet ministers were expelled from parliament. Among the parliamentary votes in question was the government s defeat of a proposed wide-ranging inquiry into Australia s scandal-hit banking sector. A powerful inquiry into Australia s banks, which are under fire after scams involving money-laundering, misleading financial advice, insurance fraud and interest-rate rigging, was approved by the upper house Senate this year, but fell one vote short of passing the lower house. The government lost its one-seat lower house majority on Friday when a court ruled Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was ineligible to sit in parliament as he had held dual citizenship when elected, in contradiction to the constitution. Former cabinet colleague Fiona Nash, along with three other politicians, were also expelled. The ruling has cast doubt over the validity of parliamentary votes Joyce and Nash have cast, said Tanya Plibersek, acting leader of the Australian Labor Party  We re going to look at all of our options,  Plibersek said on Monday in an interview with Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.  We are very concerned about the fact that Barnaby Joyce has been voting at a time when he shouldn t have been in the Federal Parliament and we narrowly lost votes because of that.  Joyce has said many of those decisions were made by cabinet collectively rather than himself personally and so ought to remain valid. Plibersek said legal challenges could be mounted by anyone aggrieved by the government s decisions. She flagged challenging a narrowly-won vote that cut Sunday pay rates for some workers, as well as decisions taken by Joyce and Nash in their capacity as ministers. That includes a decision to relocate a government department headquarters to Joyce s electorate and decisions on water-rights allocation and the rollout of a national fast-internet scheme.    Constitutional law academic George Williams said the issue was not so clear cut.  It s certainly uncharted waters,  said Williams, Dean of Law at the University of New South Wales. The court would  look very carefully  in particular at decisions taken since August, when Joyce and Nash realized they may be dual nationals.  It s not clear what the result would be,  he said. The Australian constitution bars politicians with dual citizenship from being elected to the national parliament. Both Joyce and Nash said they were not aware they held dual citizenship and have since renounced their New Zealand and British citizenships, respectively. Turnbull s minority government now relies on three independent lawmakers to remain in office. Joyce is expected to win a by-election for his seat on Dec. 2, which would restore the government s one-seat majority. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
China aims to set up state anti-corruption unit next year,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China aims to pass a national supervision law and set up a new commission next year to oversee an expansion of President Xi Jinping s campaign to fight corruption in the ruling Communist Party and government, the party said on Sunday.  The moves will be made during China s annual meeting of parliament early next year, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party s anti-graft watchdog, said in its report to a five-yearly party congress last week. The report, issued by the official Xinhua news agency, had not been previously released and gave few other details on the new commission.  All provinces, regions and cities must closely connect regional practices, integrate reform pilot scheme experience, implement the overall plan according to the decision of the party s Central Committee, and promote organizational integration,  the report said. The report also said former Chongqing Party boss Sun Zhengcai and a group of other top officials ousted for graft, including former security tsar Zhou Yongkang, were  schemers  and  plotters  out to further their own careers. The official line on Sun and Zhou had been that graft, not politics, was the primary reason for their downfall.  Zhao Leji, the newly appointed head of the CCDI, told the commission that they must secure a  sweeping victory  in the fight against corruption, and set up an institutionalized legal framework to make it impossible for officials to be corrupt, Xinhua reported. Zhao took over from Wang Qishan as part of a leadership reshuffle announced at the close of the 19th National Party Congress of the Communist Party, which ended last Tuesday.  Wang had been widely credited with the success and vigor of the graft fight. Analysts say Zhao is likely to take a more institutional approach. The new National Supervision Commission will work alongside the CCDI, sharing much of its power and resources, and will merge multiple additional anti-graft units, according to an announcement last year. It will also expand the purview of Xi s anti-graft campaign to include employees at state-backed institutions who are not necessarily party members. Since coming to power in 2012, Xi s signature anti-corruption drive has jailed or otherwise punished nearly 1.4 million party members and he has emphasized the importance of improving China s rule of law architecture. In his congress address, Xi said China would keep up with the  irreversible  momentum of the anti-corruption campaign, and announced a central leading group responsible for overseeing China s law-based governance. Xi also said the party would scrap the practice of secretive interrogations known as  shuanggui , in which cadres accused of graft and other disciplinary violations are routinely subjected to extrajudicial detention, isolation and interrogation by the CCDI. The CCDI only hands cases over to police and the judiciary for prosecution. International rights groups have raised concerns about torture, including sleep deprivation, being used to obtain confessions. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1

PNG says Australia responsible for hundreds of asylum seekers when detention camp closes,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will not be allowed to walk away from legal, financial and moral responsibility for nearly 800 men when it closes its asylum seeker detention center in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on Tuesday, PNG s immigration minister said. Human rights advocates are warning of a looming humanitarian crisis when the Manus Island center closes if the men are not properly resettled, with hundreds of the detainees refusing to leave the center for fear of being targeted by locals. PNG Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas said late on Sunday that Australia will remain responsible for the welfare of the men that have been detained in the Australian-funded center for more than four years. Australia refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, detaining them in camps in PNG and Nauru in the South Pacific. The United Nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centers.  It is PNG s position that as long as there is one individual from this arrangement that remains in PNG, Australia will continue to provide financial and other support to PNG to manage the persons transferred under the arrangement until the last person leaves or is independently resettled in PNG,  Thomas said in an emailed statement. Australia has already said it would spend up to A$250 million ($195 million) housing the nearly 800 refugees and asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea for the next 12 months after its controversial detention center closes. The Manus center is scheduled to close on Tuesday, after being declared illegal by a PNG court, with 600 men set to be moved to three new transit camps. Just under 200 men have already relocated. Despite threats that basic services like electricity and water will be cut off, the remaining detainees are refusing to move, citing fears for their safety. Fears of violence have been stoked further after PNG sent extra security forces to the camp. The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of refugees as part of a refugee swap deal. The United States has agreed to take up to possibly 1,250 refugees from Australia s two Pacific detention centers, but so far only 25 men from Manus have been resettled. In exchange, Australia said it will resettle Central American refugees. Australia has said those detainees not resettled in the United States will be allowed to stay in PNG or the tiny Pacific island of Nauru. But nearly all have refused invitations to settle permanently in both locations. Thomas said PNG will not force anyone to remain.  It is the responsibility of Australia to pursue third country options,  he said. Australia s acting Prime Minister Julie Bishop said on Monday that Canberra was exploring possible deals for resettlement, but added  those who have found not to be refugees should go home .  They ve been found by the (United Nations) not to be owed protection so they should return to their homes,  she said. The bulk of the detainees come from war-torn countries such as Syria and Afghanistan, and Pakistan, Iran, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1
At least 29 dead after Islamist attack on Somali hotel,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - An Islamist attack on a hotel in Mogadishu ended on Sunday after 29 people were killed during a siege lasting nearly 12 hours, police said, prompting the government to sack two top security officials over their failure to stop repeated attacks. The attack proved once again that insurgents can carry out deadly assaults in the heart of the Somali capital. Twin bombings in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed more than 350 people, the worst such attacks in the country s history. More than 50 people are still missing. Islamist militants al Shabaab claimed responsibility for  this weekend s attack, which took place ahead of a planned meeting to try to defuse tensions between the federal government and regional states. Government officials had begun to meet at the hotel to discuss strategy.   So far I am sure 29 people died - the death toll may rise,  Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters. At least 12 of the dead were police officers, Nur said. A woman was beheaded while her  three children were shot dead , he said. A Reuters witness saw seven bodies lying inside the hotel. (Click tmsnrt.rs/2gTg1ds for a graphic showing map where explosion took place) Three militants were captured alive and two others blew themselves up after they were shot, police said. Some militants may have disguised themselves and escaped with the residents who were rescued from the hotel, one police officer said. The attack began around at 5 p.m. on Saturday when a car bomb rammed the gates of Nasahablod Two hotel, which is close to the presidential palace, and destroyed the hotel s defenses. Then gunmen stormed the building. The explosion destroyed the front of the three-storey hotel and damaged the hotel next door. Many Somali officials live in fortified hotels for the security they offer.  The attack presents a further challenge to the new government of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, whose defense minister and chief of army staff resigned this month. They did not give their reasons for leaving.  On Sunday, the government sacked the country s police commander, Abdihakin Dahir Saiid, and the director general of the National Intelligence Security Agency, Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, the prime minister s office announced. Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, complained the emergency service had been denied access to the blast sight.   After the hotel operation was over, we wanted to transport the casualties ... all entrances of the scene were blocked by security forces. Al Shabaab said 40 people had been killed, including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel. The government and al Shabaab typically give different figures for victims in such attacks.  The twin bombings in Mogadishu on Oct. 14 killed at least 358 people and ignited nationwide outrage. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but the method  - a large truck bomb - is one it has often used. The militant group wants to overthrow the weak, U.N.-backed government and impose a strict form of Islamic law.  ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
"U.S. envoy Haley's blunt diplomacy targets South Sudan, Congo","JUBA, South Sudan/KITCHANGA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - In a mountainous camp for displaced Congolese, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley wrapped her arm around an inconsolable woman who recounted being raped twice.   It only makes me more passionate, it makes me more determined,  Haley told a small group of reporters traveling with her during her first trip to Africa.  I ll carry the voices of the women that I met and things that they said.  Dispatched by President Donald Trump to Ethiopia, South Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo, Haley s trip was one of the first tangible signs of interest in Africa by the nine-month old administration.  Her challenge: how to show the United States is actively engaged in Africa, where humanitarian and political crises are often overshadowed by more urgent conflicts elsewhere and at the same time honor Trump s avowed  America First  policy which puts U.S. economic and national interests ahead of international commitments. As Africa struggles to win Trump s interest, U.S. policy is more likely to be increasingly focused on countering militant threats. Washington also has a financial interest at stake as it tries to cut U.N. peacekeeping costs, for which it pays more than a quarter. Trump has made a point of saying he would not impose U.S. values on others, raising concerns among activists that human rights issues could take a backseat.   Nowhere is that more in focus than in Niger where a deadly ambush killed four U.S. troops who were there to assist local Nigerian forces fighting a local Islamic State affiliate this month. At the same time, Washington has mostly turned a blind eye to the increasingly authoritarian moves of Niger s former opposition leader, now president Mahamadou Issoufou, as it tries to stop the militant threat from expanding. Haley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was the most senior member of Trump s administration to travel to the three sub-Saharan states in a trip that showed how she balances her political skills with her nascent foreign policy and diplomacy experience. She was moved to tears after visiting displaced Congolese in Kitchanga in the conflict-ravaged east of the country. In Ethiopia s Gambella region, she kicked off her shoes and sat down on the floor to play with South Sudanese toddlers.  Those kids will be 18 one day,  Haley told a small group of reporters during her trip.  They will be an uneducated adult with no social skills that will have resented the fact that they were put in that situation and that s dangerous for the United States and that s dangerous for the world.  With U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson shying away from the spotlight, Haley has carved out a high-profile role for herself. Amid speculation about Tillerson s future Haley said that if she was offered the job:  I would say no.   Known for taking a blunt approach that has raised eyebrows among diplomats at the United Nations, Haley took her direct style to lengthy one-on-one conversations with the South Sudanese and Congolese leaders.  I think bluntness is important, but I also expected it back and I got candid conversations back from them,  she said.  That was very much appreciated because we didn t want to have to sit there and deal with the political talk, we wanted to get to the realities of the situation.  It s not clear yet if South Sudanese and Congolese leaders will heed her message. In Kinshasa she spoke privately with President Joseph Kabila for 90 minutes. She had said Kinshasa must hold a long-delayed election to replace Kabila by the end of next year or the vote will lose international support. But the Congolese opposition was critical of her statement there because it conceded there would be no election this year, in violation of a deal Kabila s camp signed with the opposition last December, without extracting any concessions in return.  Calling for Kabila to stay in power beyond Dec. 31, 2017 is the equivalent, pure and simple, of making oneself complicit with the evil genius!  opposition leader Olivier Kamitatu wrote on Twitter above a photo of Haley from her visit.  In Juba, Haley met with President Salva Kiir for 45 minutes, showing him photos of refugees from her visit to Gambella. South Sudan spiraled into a civil war in 2013, just two years after gaining independence from Sudan, sparked by a feud between Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer. The U.S. invested heavily in the process that led to South Sudan s independence. The Trump administration has been far less engaged, let alone influential, in trying to end the war that erupted. Haley plans to meet with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster this week to discuss her trip.  I ll give options and then if asked I ll give the recommendation,  Haley said.  (Trump) very much wants to know how everybody else feels, he very much takes all that into consideration and then he makes his decision.    ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Macedonia's opposition rejects results of municipal vote,"SKOPJE (Reuters) - Macedonia s main opposition leader cried foul over local election results after gains for the ruling party in a second round of polls on Sunday, and demanded a snap parliamentary vote. The ruling Social Democrats (SDSM) won in 40 municipalities out of a total 85 in the first round two weeks ago, including in the capital Skopje. Nineteen areas which were undecided on Oct. 16 voted again on Sunday, and the SDSM declared victory in 10. Final results were expected after midnight. Following the second round, the opposition VMRO-DPMNE s leader Nikola Gruevski dismissed the results.  Because of the election violence, raping of democracy ... threats, pressure, massive bribes, the VMRO-DPMNE does not recognize these elections and will never consider them fair and democratic,  Gruevski told reporters.  He said a snap parliamentary vote should be organized by a technical government and demanded the resignation of the head of the state electoral commission and an investigation of the alleged election fraud. Social Democrat Prime Minister Zoran Zaev dismissed Gruevski s claims and asked VMRO-DPMNE to reconsider its rejection of the results.  I am hoping they will find the strength (to act) as  responsible political subjects,  he told reporters.   After the first round, election monitors of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said fundamental freedoms were respected but that irregularities including violence were also observed. Zaev took office in May, nearly six months after December elections, ending a two-year political crisis over a wiretapping scandal that brought down the previous government.  His coalition deal with parties of ethnic Albanians, who make up nearly one third of the country s population, angered nationalists, who stormed the parliament in April after an ethnic Albanian was elected parliament s speaker.  Macedonia wants to join NATO and the European Union, but it is blocked by Greece which says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim to its own northern province of the same name.  Macedonia, an ex-Yugoslav republic of about 2 million people, avoided violence during the breakup of the former federation in the 1990s but was rocked by an ethnic Albanian insurgency in 2001.

Greek government in spat with Spain's ambassador over Catalonia,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece called on Spain s ambassador to Athens on Sunday to rescind statements to a Greek newspaper suggesting that Athens was not supportive of Spanish unity, revealing strains between the European Union partners over a Catalan independence drive.  It is with surprise that we note the comments made by the ambassador of friend and ally Spain, criticising publicly the Greek government,  the Greek Foreign Ministry said in a statement. EU leaders, wary of encouraging separatists across the bloc, have largely backed the Madrid government during a deepening political crisis which culminated last week in the Catalan parliament voting to unilaterally declare the region s independence from Spain. The Spanish Ambassador to Greece, Enrique Viguera, was quoted in Sunday s Eleftheros Typos newspaper as saying that while he had clear assurances of support for Spanish unity from Greece s conservative opposition and from President Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the same was not true of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras s left-wing government.  Statements on the issue from the part of the (Greek) government are absent. However, other European governments warmly supported the territorial integrity of Spain and our government s position,  he said. On Saturday, Greece, through its government spokesman, said it fully supported Spain s territorial integrity and cohesion as well as any initiative to restore democratic dialogue in the framework of Spain s constitution.  We are particularly concerned over the situation in Spain and reiterate that Europe can only advance united. Unilateral actions cannot be acceptable,  government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement. The Foreign Ministry accused the ambassador of  insulting Greece s constitution  by suggesting that the country s president did not speak for the government. It also said that by adopting the arguments of the political opposition, Spain s ambassador was interfering in Greece s domestic politics.  We call on the ambassador to avoid behaving in a way that is not in line with diplomatic norms and expect that he will proceed to rescind his unfortunate statements and provide the Greek government with the necessary explanations,  the ministry said.

Liberia's ruling party backs challenge to presidential result,"MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia s ruling party, whose candidate finished runner-up in the first round of this month s presidential election, said on Sunday it would back a legal challenge to the result, accusing President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of interfering in the vote.     The extraordinary charge by Unity Party against Johnson Sirleaf, one of its own members, throws into question a second round run-off scheduled for Nov. 7 between its candidate Vice President Joseph Boakai and front-runner George Weah. Unity Party said in a statement that the Oct. 10 poll, meant to usher in Liberia s first democratic transition of power since 1944, was  characterised by massive systematic irregularities and fraud .  The statement, read to reporters by Unity Party Chairman Wilmont Paye, said Johnson Sirleaf had acted inappropriately by meeting privately with elections magistrates before the vote.  Greed has resurfaced in its most callous form, sowing seeds of discord yet again with the intent of disrupting the fragile peace of Liberia,  the party said in its statement.     Unity Party officials said they were supporting a legal challenge by Liberty Party of the third-place candidate Charles Brumskine, which has petitioned the elections commission for a re-run of the first round. The All Liberian Party of businessman Benoni Urey also said on Sunday it was backing the complaint.  It doesn t mean we will not take part in the (run-off),  Augustine Ngafuan, Unity Party s national campaign chairman, told Reuters.  We hope the court can rule before the run-off. If not, we will decide what next to do.  An official from the elections commission said it expected to hear the formal complaint on Monday. The commission s findings can be appealed in the Supreme Court. At Johnson Sirleaf s residence, where she was celebrating her 79th birthday, her spokesman Jerolinmek Piah told reporters that he would comment on the accusations later as he did not want to overshadow the festivities. International observers from the European Union, the Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute have said they saw no major problems with the vote. Unity Party s statement cements a falling out between Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and her party s leadership after 12 years in power that saw the country consolidate a post-war peace but it also drew sharp criticism over alleged corruption and underdevelopment. Boakai has served as Johnson Sirleaf s vice president since the president s inauguration in 2006. However, Johnson Sirleaf declined to endorse him and he distanced himself from the last administration. Weah, a former soccer star in Europe, won the first round with 38.4 percent of the vote to Boakai s 28.8 percent and has momentum heading into the run-off. On Thursday he picked up the endorsement of former warlord Prince Johnson, who won 8 percent of the vote in the first round.  Morluba Morlu, a senior official from Weah s CDC party, said those challenging the result were  opting to stage trouble .  But no matter what they do ... they cannot stop the election of Ambassador Weah,  he added. Weah has been a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.   ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1

France arrests brother of ex-Burkina president Compaore,"PARIS (Reuters) - Francois Compaore, the younger brother of former Burkina Faso president Blaise Compaore, was taken into custody by French authorities on Sunday in connection with the murder of a journalist, his lawyer said. The killing in 1998 of Norbert Zongo, who published Burkina Faso s Independent newspaper, became a symbol of repression during Blaise Compaore s 27-year rule, which ended in 2014 at the hands of a popular uprising.  Before his death, Zongo had been investigating the murder of a driver who worked for Francois Compaore, and his killing triggered violent protests. Francois Compaore was arrested at Paris s Charles de Gaulle airport after returning to France from Ivory Coast, where his brother lives in exile, his lawyer Pierre-Olivier Sur said in a statement.  Compaore will appear before a judge within 48 hours, he added. Burkina Faso media said he was held on an arrest warrant issued by that country s government. His lawyer said only it was an international arrest warrant. French prosecutors could not immediately be reached for comment on the case. Sur said the charges were politically motivated by a Burkinabe government unable to get its hands on Blaise Compaore, whom the Ivorian government refuses to extradite despite an international warrant for his arrest in connection with the 1987 murder of former president Thomas Sankara. Burkina Faso s uprising and subsequent elections raised hopes the country would finally reckon with past crimes, but some activists say the government of current president Roch Marc Christian Kabore has moved too slowly against former regime members, some of whom serve in the new administration. Authorities opened a trial this week against allies of Blaise Compaore accused of leading a failed coup d etat in 2015, including the alleged mastermind, Compaore s former spy chief General Gilbert Diendere.

"Brazil's Lula, Bolsonaro well positioned for 2018 elections: poll","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian Former President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva and right-wing congressman Jair Bolsonaro would make it to a second round of voting in the 2018 presidential elections if they were held today, an Ibope poll showed on Sunday. The poll, published in the O Globo newspaper, showed center-left Lula winning 35 to 36 percent of the vote in the October 2018 race regardless of the candidates he theoretically runs against.  Law-and-order congressman Bolsonaro, whose popularity has been spurred by rising violence in cities like Rio de Janeiro that were hard-hit by the country s troubled economy, would win 15 percent if he faced off against Lula. Marina Silva, Former Environmental Minister for Lula, would take third placed in any voting field that included Lula as a candidate with 8 to 11 percent of the vote. Silva would tie with Bolsonaro for first place if Lula were out of the picture. Despite Lula s popularity, his political future hangs in the balance after he was convicted in July of receiving bribes from a construction firm in return for help winning government contracts. In August, he said his Workers Party might have to run a different candidate. Ibope s poll of 2,000 people in all of Brazil s states was conducted between Oct. 18 and 22. It has a margin of error of two percentage points.  ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
"Merkel, party leaders meet to rev up German coalition talks: media","BERLIN (Reuters) - Key allies of Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday downplayed reports about a crisis among parties in a potential coalition government, saying it was important to work out differences and reach a sustainable agreement. Merkel was due to meet with leaders of the other parties on Sunday to smooth the waters after last week s exploratory talks ran into trouble over immigration and climate policy. The chancellor, whose conservative alliance came first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 national election, is trying to forge a three-way coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmental Greens that is untested at a national level. Bild am Sonntag newspaper said Merkel would try to  rescue  the talks by meeting with Horst Seehofer, who heads the conservative Bavarian CSU party, two officials from the Greens and FDP leader Christian Lindner at an undisclosed location. Volker Kauder, parliamentary leader of the conservatives, told broadcaster ZDF that such meetings were not unusual, even once a coalition had been formed. He said it was important to demonstrate that the mainstream parties could govern, a clear nod to the protest votes that propelled the far-right Alternative for Germany party into parliament for the first time.  It s about more than the individual party positions, it s about building trust in the ability of the democratic parties to take action,  Kauder said. Peter Altmaier, Merkel s chief of staff, told broadcaster ARD a coalition deal looked more promising now than weeks ago, but it could take time to work out solutions on climate and immigration that would stand the test of time.  We need a result that is in the interest of the country and that will last for four years,  he said. The exploratory talks are due to continue Monday after the three sides failed to reach agreement on immigration and climate issues during an 11-hour session on Thursday. The possible coalition partners remain at odds over how to meet carbon dioxide emission targets and capping migration. Many conservatives want to take a harder line on immigration, blaming their election setback on Merkel s decision to allow in more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016. They want to limit refugee numbers, but the Greens reject such a cap. Other issues such as pensions and labor regulations - which could be on the agenda on Monday - appear less contentious. The three blocs are also nearing agreement on the issue of legalizing marijuana through pharmacies or other licensed distributors, the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper reported. Alexander Lambsdorff, deputy leader of the FDP parliamentary group, said the FDP and Greens had  no choice but to talk to each other  given the current political circumstances. The Social Democrats, junior partner to the conservatives over the last four years, have vowed to stay in opposition. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Philippines' Duterte says to deal with Trump in 'most righteous way',"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Sunday he would deal with U.S. President Donald Trump  in the most righteous way  when they meet next month to discuss regional security and Manila s war on drugs. Trump will travel to Asia on Nov. 3-14 amid rising tensions over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs. He will be in Manila on the last leg of his trip, which includes visits to Japan, South Korea, China, and Vietnam, to attend the ASEAN leaders  summit. Trump will meet with Duterte but will skip the larger meeting in Manila with heads of states and governments from China, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand.  It would be terrorism, cooperation between the two countries, the fight against drugs. I expect to be dealing with him around these topics,  Duterte said in a media briefing before leaving for Japan to meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  I would deal with President Trump in the most righteous way, welcome him as an important leader,  he said.  I would have to also listen to him, what he has to say.   Duterte is known for his often profanity-laden tirades against the United States, chiding Washington for treating the Philippines  like a dog,  despite the two nations  longstanding relationship. The Philippines  leader announced his  separation  from the United States during a visit to Beijing a year ago, declaring he had realigned with China as the two agreed to resolve their South China Sea dispute through talks. Duterte was infuriated by expressions of concern by members of former President Barack Obama s administration about extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. But Trump, in a phone call to Duterte in May, praised the Philippine leader for doing an  unbelievable job on the drug problem  despite human rights groups  condemnation of Duterte s drug crackdown, in which thousands of people have been killed. Human rights, rule of law and due process are among  important developments  the two leaders would likely discuss during their bilateral talks, Sung Kim, U.S. ambassador to Manila, told foreign correspondents last week. Duterte is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the Philippines, which his government denies. He defended his 16-month-old campaign last week, telling Southeast Asian lawyers at a gathering in Manila that he had been  demonized  and denying allegations of state-sponsored killings of drug dealers and users. Duterte, speaking in Davao City on Sunday night, said the situation in the Korean Peninsula would be the main agenda item in his talks with Trump.  We are worried. If anything can go wrong, it will go wrong,  he said.  A nuclear war is totally unacceptable to everybody.  Duterte said it would be good if the United States, Japan and South Korea would sit down and talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and  tell him that nobody s threatening him, that there would be no war, and that if you can just tone down or stand down, stop the threats, and that would be the same for America.  Duterte previously described Kim as a  fool  and  son of a bitch  for  playing with dangerous toys.  Duterte said the North Korea threats would also be discussed during his meeting with Abe, along with Tokyo s assistance to rebuild the conflict-torn Marawi City in southern Philippines and for Manila s infrastructure projects.

Hundreds rally in France to protest sexual harassment after Weinstein scandal,"PARIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of women attended rallies in Paris and other French cities on Sunday to protest against sexual harassment in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.  U.S. movie mogul Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including three who said they were raped. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.  Justice for Women ;  We Won t Remain Silent ;  The Shame Should Switch Sides  read some of the signs held by French demonstrators, who were predominantly women.  In Paris, protesters gathered at the Place de la Republique square under a grayish rainy sky, responding to a call that spread globally last week on social networks under the hashtag #MeToo.  The hashtag has been used by millions of women across the world to share their experiences of sexual harassment and abuse on Twitter and rolling posts on Facebook. Among those at the rally in Paris was 88-year-old Vivianne Rouis, who attended with her daughter and granddaughter.  At my age it s over, nothing s going to happen to me. But my daughter, my granddaughter, it s true that I think about them a lot,  Rouis told Reuters TV.  It has to stop. Because we re not objects,  she added. Other protesters urged victims to speak up.   It s less and less taboo in our society and I think it s important that women, and even men, who are abused, speak about it more freely,  said Luana da Costa, 17. Hundreds of thousands of accounts of sexual harassment or abuse have been published under the French #balancetonporc or #squealonyourpig hashtag on Twitter over the past few weeks, including from prominent actresses such as Lea Seydoux. Some conservatives say the new trend amounts to an attack on the French way of life in the name of U.S.-style puritanism. Nationwide consultations started this month over a proposed new law that will include steps to fight sexual harassment on the streets as well as extend the statute of limitations for rape on minors.

"""Nobody stood with the Kurds"" says bitter Barzani","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani gave a bitter speech on Sunday to announce his resignation, saying no one outside the Kurds  home region had stood up to support their right of self-determination.  Barzani made a televised speech after the Iraqi Kurdistan  parliament approved his request not to extend his term beyond Nov. 1, after an independence referendum he championed last month backfired and triggered military and economic retaliation against the Kurdish region he has been leading since 2005.  Three million votes for Kurdistan independence created history and cannot be erased,  he said, referring to the referendum held on Sept. 25.   Nobody stood up with us other than our mountains,  he said, speaking with Kurdish and Iraqi flags behind him. He criticized the United States for allowing Abrams tanks  supplied to Iraqi forces to fight Islamic State militants to be used against the Kurds. He said American weapons were also used in attacks by Iranian-backed paramilitaries.  Without the help of Peshmerga (Kurdish fighters), Iraqi forces could not have liberated Mosul from ISIS alone,  he said, referring to Islamic State s former stronghold in northern Iraq.  Why would Washington want to punish Kurdistan?  He said followers of rival Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, who died in early October, had been guilty of  high treason  for handing over the oil city of Kirkuk to Iraqi forces without a fight two weeks ago.  He said the Iraqi offensives since Oct. 16 and the refusal of the Iraqi government to agree to dialogue vindicated his view that  Iraq no longer believes in Kurdish rights .

British minister to be investigated over sexual harassment allegation," (Note: Readers might find some language offensive in paragraph 2) LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered an investigation into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys for him, as she tries to tackle a culture of sexual harassment in politics. Mark Garnier, a junior international trade minister, asked secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy two sex toys and he also called her  sugar tits , the Mail on Sunday reported. Garnier told the paper that the comment was part of an amusing conversation about a television show, and that asking her to buy the toys was  good humored high jinks .  Edmondson, in comments to the paper, disputed Garnier s recollection of the incidents, including his assertion that they were  high jinks . The report came after another British newspaper, the Sun, on Friday described a culture of sexual harassment among lawmakers and their staff working in parliament.     Garnier was not immediately available for comment to Reuters through his constituency or parliamentary offices. May s spokeswoman said on Friday after the Sun s report that any unwanted sexual behavior was  completely unacceptable  and any minister who acted inappropriately would face  serious action . Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said on Sunday May had asked officials to investigate if Garnier, whose role is outside the cabinet immediately surrounding May, had broken the government ministers  code of behavior.   These stories, if they are true, are obviously totally unacceptable,  Hunt told BBC television.  The Cabinet Office will be conducting an investigation as to whether there has been a breach of the ministerial code in this particular case, but as you know the facts are disputed.  May, in a letter released to media, also asked John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, on Sunday for his advice about changing the culture there.  I believe it is important that those who work in the House of Commons are treated properly and fairly, as would be expected in any modern workplace,  May said in the letter. She said measures such as a disciplinary procedure suggested by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and a voluntary code of conduct offered by the Conservative Party to its lawmakers did not go far enough.  I believe that we must establish a House-wide mediation service complemented by a contractually binding grievance procedure available for all MPs (lawmakers) irrespective of their party banner,  she said in the letter.  It is vital that staff and the public have confidence in parliament, and resolving this employment irregularity on a cross-party basis can play an important role in this.  Reports of inappropriate behavior in British politics, and in other industries, came in the wake of dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Britain s environment minister Michael Gove apologized on Saturday after he likened being interviewed by a BBC radio presenter to entering Weinstein s bedroom. After the analogy was widely criticized, Gove, a cabinet minister, apologized for what he said was a  clumsy attempt at humor . The Sun newspaper said on Friday that women working in politics in Westminster had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators.  The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics,  May s spokeswoman said on Friday.

"In Kenya, polarizing election re-run rekindles ethnic tensions","MUHORONI, Kenya (Reuters) - Kenya s repeat presidential election, boycotted this week by millions, has reignited long-running tensions between ethnic communities in some areas, leading inhabitants of one small village in the west to pick up traditional arms on Saturday.  In the bright green sugarcane fields where the western Nyanza region rolls toward the Nandi hills, two tribes   the Luo and the Kalenjin   have lived in relative peace for years.  But in the village of Koguta, down the road from the town of Mugoroni in Kisumu County, Thursday s polarizing vote reignited old grievances.  The stand-off, defused by an emergency intervention of three county governors, was a stark reminder of how easily Kenya s months-long political crisis could spark the type of ethnic violence that killed 1,200 people after a flawed 2007 vote.  On one side of Koguta are Kalenjins, here ardent supporters of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Kalenjin deputy, William Ruto. But the Luos across the road support opposition leader Raila Odinga, who called for a boycott of the vote because he said it would not be fair.  Some of the Luos here fought police to stop ballot boxes being delivered. The Luo accused the Kalenjin of stealing cattle and burning their sugarcane crop in revenge, prompting both sides to grab machetes, spears, bows and arrows, and wooden clubs.   This is an area where they tried to come in with ballot boxes, there was serious resistance, so that was the genesis of all this enmity between the Kalenjins and the Luos,  said Julius Genga, a county legislator, as a colleague stood atop a sports utility vehicle to calm a crowd of men with spears. The opposition dismissed the vote as a  sham  although Kenyatta s supporters say it was legitimate. Protests stopped four counties from opening polling stations at all. Only a third of voters turned up, and the opposition is likely to challenge the poll in court.   This has to do with politics,  said Collins Owuor, 21, holding a machete.  Before politics we did not have problems with these people.  In the distance, where smoke rose from sugarcane fields, Reuters saw police speaking to spear-wielding Kalenjins, but the local police chief warned journalists away.  By the end of the afternoon s meetings, the cattle had been returned and officials said they hoped the risk of violence had been quelled. Koguta is not the only place where simmering ethnic tensions have broken into the open.  On Friday night in the Nairobi slum of Kawangware, a man was beaten to death and homes and shop burned down amid rumors that a TRIBAL militia had infiltrated the neighborhood of a different tribe.  In Thursday s vote, Kenyatta only faced six minor candidates, none of whom won more than 1 percent in August, and that and the low turnout have quashed his hopes of securing a decisive mandate to lead east Africa s richest economy. Deputy president William Ruto, Kenyatta s running mate, told CNN on Saturday he expected the final tally from the vote to be ready by Sunday:   Shortly we will be having a declaration and finally a swearing in, in accordance with the constitution.     The election board said on Saturday it would soon announce a new plan for the nearly 30 of 290 constituencies that have not voted yet. The constitution says the vote must be  held in every constituency.  More legal cases against the election are expected next week. If the courts fail to find a path out of the crisis, including a possible order for another rerun, the protracted and economically damaging stalemate between the Kenyatta and Odinga camps is likely to continue. The electoral saga is polarizing the nation and slowing growth in what has been one of Africa s most vibrant economies, which is also a regional trade hub and a security ally for Western nations.  In Odinga strongholds, residents accused authorities of trying to  force  voter participation.  This is pure oppression,  said Hassan Hussein, a Muslim community leader.  The law says if you want to vote, you vote, if not, you don t.      ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Man killed with arrows in Kenyan village on edge over elections,"KOGUTA/KISUMU, Kenya (Reuters) - The body of a man was found in a sugarcane field in western Kenya on Sunday, a day after high-level officials visited the area aiming to calm ethnic tensions inflamed by this week s presidential election.  The Luo community largely boycotted Thursday s election, which was supposed to pit opposition leader Raila Odinga, a Luo, against President Uhuru Kenyatta, a Kikuyu with a Kalenjin deputy president. The Supreme Court ordered a repeat of the vote after it nullified Kenyatta s win in an August election on procedural grounds. The motive for the killing of 64-year-old George Odumbe and the identity of its perpetrators were unclear. It came a day after villagers from the Luo and Kalenjin communities armed themselves against each other.  The body of Odumbe, a Luo laborer at a sugar company, was found with three arrows in the back and severe head wounds, a Reuters witness in the village of Koguta said. It was found in a field between Koguta and the nearby Kalenjin village of Mau. Locals warned the death of the Luo man could spark tit-for-tat violence.  There s a desire for revenge by the Luo community, I m trying to tell them to stay calm, but they are so bitter and angry,  Gordon Onyango, 32, a Luo, said.  The two sides are both having meetings now and they are both armed.   Reuters was unable to speak with the Kalenjin community in Mau, but saw a group of young men from the village gathered under a tree. Most were armed with bows and arrows. Odinga withdrew from the rerun election, saying it would not be fair. In his strongholds in the west, an area that has long felt excluded from political and economic power, protesters prevented polling stations from opening in four counties.  Across Kenya, 10 percent of polling stations were unable to open, although there were no problems in Kenyatta s areas. Turnout dropped to 43 percent from 80 percent in August, the election commission said. In some parts of the country, such as Koguta in Kisumu county, protests damaged relations with other communities who wanted to vote for Kenyatta.  That anger risks igniting ethnic violence, which killed around 1,200 people after a disputed 2007 presidential vote, but which has been largely absent from this election. At least 51 people have been killed in political violence since August, but most deaths have occurred in clashes between protesters and police. Police, although stationed only 400 meters from where the body was discovered, declined to visit the scene for several hours until reinforcements arrived.  Police did not answer calls from Reuters. But Julius Genga, a county legislator, said by phone while he was driving to the scene:  We want the police to be deployed to try to restore calm because after the death of this man, tension is boiling up and we don t want it to escalate it to unmanageable levels.  Kericho county governor Paul Chepkwony told Reuters that he hoped the death would be  an isolated one . Not all recent attacks were ethnically based. On Friday police shot dead a man who was part of a group that stormed the home of former lawmaker James Rege, who had defected to the ruling party from Odinga s movement three years into his term, Homa Bay police commander Marius Tum told Reuters on Sunday.  Both Rege and his attackers were Luo, Tum said, and police were investigating whether other lawmakers had organised the attack.  ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Kenya opposition leader calls for calm in slum hit by deadly violence,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga called for calm on Sunday as he visited a slum in the capital that was hit by violence when a political stand-off over a repeat presidential election fed into rising ethnic tensions. Clashes in Kawangware and in a village in western Kenya following Thursday s vote were the first signs that face-offs between Odinga supporters and the police might eventually morph into neighbors turning against each other.  A country cannot be ruled by the gun. Standing here in this church we want to condemn the militarization of politics in this country,  Odinga told residents in the Nairobi slum. The veteran opposition leader had boycotted the re-run of an August presidential election that was nullified by Kenya s Supreme Court on procedural grounds, leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta with an almost free run against six minor candidates. On Friday, a day after the repeat vote was held in most of the country, ethnic violence in Kawangware saw dozens of homes and shops torched and one man killed. Most of buildings torched belonged to residents from the Kenyatta s Kikuyu tribe.  One man from Odinga s Luo group was killed overnight near  Koguta village in the west of the country, after residents from two ethnic groups backing different candidates armed themselves.  If such isolated incidents become a trend, it could ignite large swathes of Kenya, as happened after a 2007 presidential election when weeks of violence left 1,200 dead. That sent ripples throughout East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and diplomatic hub.  In his speech, Odinga condemned violence generally and did not single out any particular attack.   We have come here to give consolation to those who were beaten and killed. We as NASA condemn what happened,  he told worshippers at a church in Kawangware, referring to his National Super Alliance, an opposition coalition.  Odinga boycotted Thursday s vote because he said the contest would not be fair. Instead, he wanted the Oct. 26 contest dismissed and fresh elections held within 90 days.  His withdrawal means Kenyans are watching the turnout, rather than the result, for an indication of Kenyatta s popularity for a second, five-year term.  Results published on Sunday by the election commission showed that Kenyatta had won slightly more than 98 percent of the vote with results in from 244 out of 291 constituencies.  Turnout for the constituencies counted so far was 43 percent. That figure is likely to decrease when it includes returns of 0 from least 23 constituencies where authorities were unable to open even a single polling station because of protests by Odinga s supporters.  The election board planned to try to hold elections there on Saturday, but postponed the plan amid fears of further violence. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Kurdish leader Barzani's dream of independence led to downfall,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Masoud Barzani, who spent decades leading the long-oppressed Kurds, confirmed on Sunday he was stepping down as president of the Kurdistan Regional Government after his drive for independence backfired. After decades of struggle, critics say Barzani made one of his biggest mistakes by pushing hard for a Sept. 25 referendum.  Kurds voted overwhelmingly for independence, but won little sympathy outside their region. As well as the Iraqi government, Turkey and Iran threatened to take tough action against any move towards secession, fearing it would encourage their own restive Kurdish populations to follow suit.  The United States and other Western powers joined the chorus of opposition to the vote. The Baghdad government rejected it as illegal and sent troops to seize the oil city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds regard as the heart of any future homeland. In just a few hours, the city the Kurds regard as sacred was gone, along with other Kurdish-held territory across the north.  Some accused Barzani of having led his people to disaster. For many years, he had used cunning and patience to help the Kurds survive long years of brutality under Saddam Hussein. After the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam in 2003, Barzani became a central figure in the drive to create an autonomous Kurdish state in northern Iraq. Kurdish leaders kept their territory relatively free of the sectarian bloodshed that plagued most of Iraq. Western oil executives flocked to the region seeking deals.   Kurds showed their military capability by joining Iraqi government troops and Iranian-backed paramilitary forces to drive Islamic State militants out of Mosul. Confident that the time was right for an independent homeland, Barzani pursued the referendum.  It resulted in overwhelming support for secession. But the joy was short-lived as Iraqi government forces and Shi ite paramilitaries shattered the Kurds  dreams with a series of lightning military advances.  Barzani was born in 1946, soon after his legendary father founded a party to fight for the rights of Iraqi Kurds.  Deeply influenced by his father, Mulla Mustafa Barzani, known as the Lion of Kurdistan, Masoud Barzani joined the Kurdish guerrilla forces known as the Peshmerga at the age of 16 and gained fighting experience in the mountains. The younger Barzani would become familiar with one of the popular themes in Kurdish history - betrayal by regional and Western powers. Exiled and dying of cancer in a Washington hospital in 1976, Mulla Mustafa lamented that he had ever trusted the United States.   A year earlier, Mulla Mustafa had been fighting a guerrilla war against Baghdad backed by Iran s pro-Western shah, but he was left high and dry when then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger brokered a deal that allowed Saddam to crush the Kurds. During the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Masoud Barzani allied the Kurdistan Democratic Party that he had inherited from his father with Tehran once more. It did not go well. Some 8,000 Barzani tribesmen were rounded up and paraded through Baghdad before being executed. In Saddam s words:  They went to hell.  Despite the massacres, and Iraqi chemical attacks, Barzani retained enough of a fighting force to respond to President George Bush s appeal for an uprising during the 1991 Gulf War. Taking Bush at his word, the Kurds rose up against Saddam,  and Barzani and his Peshmerga - known as  those who face death  - came down from the mountains to join the uprising and capture several cities in the north. But the victorious allies balked at the prospect of a Kurdish split from Baghdad and did nothing to stop Saddam s troops and helicopter gunships from crushing the rebellion.   While more than a million Kurds fled to Turkey and Iran, many dying of hunger and exposure on the way, Barzani stayed to fight on.  He was saved by a U.S. and British no-fly zone established over the north in 1991 which allowed him and his Kurdish rival, Jalal Talabani, to retake the area.   This was followed by the longest period of Kurdish autonomy in modern history, but it was scarred by civil war between Barzani and Talabani s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in the mid-1990s.   Barzani invited Iraqi government tanks into the region in 1996 to seize the regional capital Erbil, sending not only Talabani, but dozens of CIA personnel and their local employees fleeing before them. Talabani died barely a week after last month s referendum.  Barzani s exit will leave the Kurds lacking direction, with their two main leaders gone. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Copts call for action over church closures in southern Egypt,"MINYA, Egypt (Reuters) - Coptic Christians in the south of Egypt renewed calls on local authorities for an end to discrimination, after a number of churches have been closed down in recent weeks.  Two churches in two separate villages in the southern province of Minya have been shut down by the authorities, a statement by the Minya diocese said.  It said worshippers were harassed at both churches and pelted with rocks at one of them.    We have kept quiet for two weeks after the closure of one of the churches, but due to our silence the situation has worsened ... it is as if prayer is a crime the Copts must be punished for,  the statement, dated Saturday, read. A third church was closed following rumors of a pending attack, but the diocese said no attack has taken place since and the church remains closed.  The Minya security directorate spokesman declined to comment. The governor s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Coptic Christians, who make up 10 percent of Egypt s population of nearly 95 million, say they have been persecuted for years. Many feel the state does not take their plight seriously enough. Nonetheless, the Copts are vocal supporters of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has vowed to crush Islamist extremism and protect Christians. He declared a three-month state of emergency in the aftermath of two church bombings in April which has since been renewed. Though Islamic State has long waged a low-level war against soldiers and police in Egypt s Sinai peninsula, it has stepped up its assault on Christian civilians in the mainland. In an attack claimed by the group in May, gunmen ambushed a group of Coptic Christians traveling to a monastery in Minya, killing 29 and wounding 24. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
"Syrian army, allies step up attacks on last militant bastion in Deir al-Zor city","AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army, supported by Russian jets and Iranian-backed militias, escalated bombing on Sunday of areas of the Syrian city of Deir al-Zor still held by Islamic State. Former residents and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there were heavy aerial strikes on eastern Syria s largest city as troops pushed towards the Hay al Umal area, which overlooks some of the remaining militant-held neighborhoods where an estimated 1,500 civilians are trapped. The Syrian army has gradually tightened the noose around the militants after it opened a land route into the city in September with the help of Russian air strikes and Iran-backed militias, breaking a siege that had lasted nearly three years.  The situation is catastrophic, there are families under the rubble and others who fled have no shelter,  said Sheikh Awad al Hajr, a tribal leader, referring to the plight of those remaining inside the city and in cities, towns and farms in the fertile strip along the Euphrates bordering Iraq. Fighting and relentless air strikes in Deir al-Zor province, the last stronghold of the Islamic State, have prompted tens of thousands of civilians to flee, former residents and aid workers say.  Relatives of some civilians and Syrian opposition figures accuse the Russian army of bombing boats and dinghies carrying families fleeing the western banks of the Euphrates. Moscow denies it targets civilians in its military operations in Syria and says it hits only militant hideouts and facilities.     Russia has thrown its military weight behind the Syrian army campaign to regain the strategic oil-rich province which has become the focus of Syria s more than six-year long civil war. They are racing with U.S- backed forces to grab territory from Islamic State. While the Syrian army appeared to make more gains inside Deir al-Zor city, the militants made a surprise offensive in the last 24 hours that pushed back pro-government and Iranian-backed militias from Albu Kamal, the last border post on the Syrian Iraqi border still in militant hands.[L8N1N25IJ]  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and former residents said the jihadists recaptured the strategic towns of al Qwaira and Makhan on Saturday in several deadly ambushes that inflicted heavy casualties on pro-government and Iranian Shi ite militias. The latest jihadist assault pushed back the army to the city of Mayadeen, further north along the Euphrates river that the militants lost earlier this month. [L8N1MX05W]  The Islamic State was able to push back the regime and its Iranian-backed militias to the heart of the city of Mayadeen,  said Amer Huweidi, an activist from the city in touch with locals and residents. Mayadeen is a strategic city that has been a base for the militants after they were driven out of their de facto Syrian capital in Raqqa city. The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State is waging a separate campaign against the group in Deir al-Zor, focused on areas to the east of the Euphrates River which bisects the province.  The coalition secured the Omar oilfield, Syria s largest oilfield, this month.[L8N1MX05W] ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Austrian police hunt gunman after two killed in shooting,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Austrian police are searching for a 66-year-old man suspected of shooting dead two neighbors and wounding a third before escaping in a white Volkswagen van. The suspect from the Graz area is suspected of killing a 64-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman and wounding a 48-year-old woman in a dispute among neighbors, Styria province police said in a statement. The suspect fled in a Volkswagen van whose number plate matched that of one with a poster reading  Heil Hitler  across its rear window that was shown on an Austrian website. The website offers users a platform to criticize alleged abuses of power by justice officials. Police warned residents not to approach the suspect amid a search stretching across neighboring provinces. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Trump and Netanyahu share a kiss on West Bank wall mural,"BETHLEHEM, West Bank (Reuters) - Another Donald Trump mural believed to be the work of Australian graffiti artist Lushsux has popped up on Israel s barrier in the occupied West Bank, this time depicting the U.S. president sharing a kiss with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. His face hidden by a headdress, a man who identified himself as Lushsux said against the backdrop of a cement section of the Israeli wall in Bethlehem that he hoped his painting would draw attention to Palestinians stuck in  an indoor prison . The Bethlehem wall has become a showcase of protest art voicing Palestinians  fears that Israel s West Bank fence-and-concrete barrier is a land grab that may deny them a state. Israelis deem the project a bulwark against Palestinian attack.  The wall is a message in itself,  the man, who said he painted the mural overnight, told Reuters.  I don t need to write  Free Palestine  or something like that, something really direct ... that people will ignore.  I just paint what I usually paint and maybe people will start looking at the background and looking at the razor wire and looking at people stuck in here, and maybe that ll work better,  he said in Australian-accented English. Murals on the barrier believed to be the work of Lushsux include one showing Trump kissing an Israeli watchtower and another depicting him placing his hand on the barrier and thinking about building a similar wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

Iceland leans toward leftist government in snap election,"REYKJAVIK (Reuters) - Icelanders, angry over a string of political scandals, ousted their center-right government in an election that could pave the way for a charismatic young opposition leader to form a left-leaning coalition, final vote counts showed on Sunday. With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament. Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one. The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom. Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust. The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson s use of offshore tax havens. In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability. After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties. The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament s 63 seats.   The opposition has a majority, so that s a message. But we ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,  Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday. The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.  The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament. The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters. Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said:  I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it s normal that we should be a part of a future government.  We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,  he said.  We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.  His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.  The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.  I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,  said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government. The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes. The Pirate Party, which last year rode a wave of anger against the establishment to become the third biggest party in parliament, stood to get 9 percent of votes in Saturday s election down from 14 percent last year.

Turkey detains 143 people over suspected Islamic State links: Anadolu,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police detained 143 people over suspected links to Islamic State in anti-terror operations in eight cities over the weekend, the state-run Anadolu Agency said on Sunday.

"Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will continue to produce missiles for its defense and does not consider that a violation of international accords, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday in a speech broadcast on state television. Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement. He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.  We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,  Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.  The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles. Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.    You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?  Rouhani said.  Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,  Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea. Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.  Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,  it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.  For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.  Trump s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano s agency is in charge of policing. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will  shred  the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal. Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano:  He has no request in this area,  Iran s state news agency IRNA reported. Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America s preferred course.

"Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga start new round of talks, Iraqi State TV says","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters on Sunday started a second round of talks to resolve a conflict over control of the Kurdistan region s border crossings, Iraqi state TV said.  Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Friday ordered a 24-hour suspension of military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq. The two sides held a first round of talks on Friday and Saturday . Abadi said the talks are meant to prepare for the peaceful deployment of Iraqi troops at the border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria in Iraq s Kurdistan region. Clashes broke out between the two sides after Iraqi forces captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk from the Peshmerga, in a surprise offensive ordered by Abadi after the Kurds held an independence referendum in northern Iraq on Sept. 25. Kirkuk is part of so-called disputed areas, claimed by both the Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq.  The second round of talks about deploying federal troops in the disputed areas has started,  State TV said, giving no further details. Abadi wants to take control of the disputed areas and the border crossings, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil. The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and  starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution  - a call rejected by Baghdad. U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country. The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG s official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16. But the Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region. The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by KRG President Masoud Barzani, since it halved the region s oil export revenue. The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur and south of their capital, Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides. Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he was  disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution  and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG  overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution . Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks.  We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,  he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
"Losses, looting as Philippine war's fortunate few return home","MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Khaliluddin Ismail returned home on Sunday after five months of war in the southern Philippines to find his house ransacked. But he s still smiling.  At least we have something left,  he said, standing in a room with clothes, toys, ornaments and damaged pictures strewn across the floor.  Others have nothing. They lost their homes, they lost their lives.  Ismail, 44, the Imam of a nearby mosque, considers himself one of the luckiest people in Marawi. The city was devastated by more than 150 days of battles between government forces and pro-Islamic State militants that killed more than 1,100 people and displaced some 350,000. His house is in Marawi s safe zone, an area long abandoned by residents but untouched by unrelenting shelling and military air strikes that have all but flattened the city s commercial heart, destroying thousands of homes, shops and vehicles. Six days after troops killed the last remaining rebels, Ismail was among about 4,000 people allowed to return to their homes on Sunday in Marawi s Basak Malutlot area. Many like him have discovered their houses were looted and left in disarray.  I opened the door and I was shocked, but I m still happy to be home,  he said. Ismail fled with his family on May 24 during a fierce three-day firefight that erupted just 50 meters away, when security forces tried to raid the hideout of notorious militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State s anointed  emir  in Southeast Asia. Hapilon escaped, then issued a call to arms to hundreds of insurgents to initiate their planned takeover of Marawi. It sparked the Philippines  biggest urban battle in recent history, and fears that Islamic State s extremist agenda had gained a foothold in the south of the mainly Catholic country. There were scenes of joy and chaos as a convoy of returning residents poured in to Marawi to a cacophony of horns and whistles, jamming what only a few hours earlier were deserted streets. Armed police at checkpoints cross-checked documents and pictures of each passengers from the 712 families, to guard against possible infiltration by militants. Babies cried as officials at a public hall shouted on megaphones to try to establish order as hundreds jostled to register for the sack of rice and 5,000 pesos ($97) allocated to each household. With a stern face, the district s elderly chairwoman, Jamellah Indol Saro, yelled in the local Maranao dialect at anxious residents to calm down.  I told them we have to thank Allah we re still alive,  she said, smiling. Some 6,500 families are due to return this week in a phased repatriation, a fraction of the 77,000 that fled to evacuation camps or nearby towns. Many face a lengthy wait for vast swathes of Marawi to be rebuilt. Retired government employee Mitormar Goling, 72, came home to find jewellery, money, furniture and antiques had been stolen. He said he feared he would have starved or been killed had he stayed behind.  We felt the ground trembling from the air strikes. We didn t know if the army could protect us,  said Goling, wearing sunglasses and a white skull cap.  If you don t believe in their ideology, ISIS sees you as the enemy,  he said, referring to Islamic State. He was among many people who said they understood that the military had to destroy the city to save it. Norida Manna s three-storey house was levelled by an air strike, but she s thankful she s alive.  The office clerk and single mother of six will now live at her sister s home, from which she fled in May as troops outside battled hooded, black-clad gunmen who helped the escape of Hapilon. The rebel commander was subsequently killed in a military operation 13 days ago.   My home was destroyed, but I don t blame the military. They had a job to do,  she said.  I have nothing left, but to us, every day is a happy one now. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Thai king's remains laid to rest at end of five-day ceremony,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - The bones and ashes of Thailand s late King Bhumibol Adulyadej were brought to their final resting places on Sunday, the fifth and last day of an elaborate funeral ceremony that drew hundreds of thousands of mourners to the streets of Bangkok. King Bhumibol, the world s longest reigning monarch when he died last year at the age of 88, ruled Thailand from shortly after World War Two and was revered as a stabilizing figure through coups, protests and natural disasters. The $90 million royal funeral drew mourners clad in black from across the country to Bangkok, where King Bhumibol was cremated on Thursday in an elaborate gold crematorium built for the ceremony outside the Grand Palace. (Interactive Graphic   tmsnrt.rs/2leWzcQ) Over 19 million Thais - more than a quarter of the 69 million population - participated in ceremonies by presenting symbolic sandalwood flowers to be burned at temples and crematorium replicas across the country, according to the government.  On Sunday, the late king s bones were moved to the Chakri Throne Hall, where royal relics are kept within the Grand Palace in a ceremony that involved senior monks from temples across the country. His son, new King Maha Vajiralongkorn, led the religious rite. On Sunday evening, Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana led  the final royal procession on horseback to the Wat Rajabopidh and Wat Bovoranives temples where her grandfather s ashes were placed in keeping with a ceremony steeped in religious symbolism and tradition. Mourners, some in tears, were gathered outside the temples.  I will always have him stored in my heart. Whether as pictures, however old and torn, the memory of him will always be kept in my heart,  said Chalermporm Prabutr, 72.    Wat Rajabopidh was built by the late king s grandfather, King Chualalongkorn, and houses the remains of other royals including the late king s father, Prince Mahidol and the princess mother, Srinagarindra. Some of the late king s ashes were also be laid at Wat Bovoranives, the temple where he entered the monkhood in 1956 after his grandmother s death, a custom for Buddhist males after the death of a relative.  Wat Bovoranives is also the center of the more austere strain of Thai Buddhism founded by the late king s great grandfather, King Mongkut. Many Thais have worn black for the past year in mourning for King Bhumibol. The military government has told people to wear bright clothes from Monday, when the mourning period formally ends.

Poland wants strong euro zone before mulling membership - finance minister,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland wants the euro zone to become stronger before making a decision whether to join the single currency, Finance Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said.  We are holding our fingers crossed for the euro zone to survive, to overcome its imminent problems ... Surely, the convergence is not happening as the authors wished it, Morawiecki, who is also deputy prime minister, told journalists.  We would like the euro area to be strong and then in a few years will see how it copes with everything.  The statement suggests a softening towards the euro zone membership by the eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party that came to power two years ago.  Although he declined to say when Poland could start thinking about membership, on Friday, he told an economic forum that he is not an  opponent  of introducing the euro currency in Poland, but the time is not right yet.

According to various polls, more than two thirds of Poles oppose joining the euro area. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
U.S. pressure delays Israel's 'Greater Jerusalem' bill: legislator,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. pressure delayed an Israeli ministerial vote on Sunday on a proposed bill that Washington fears entails annexation of Jewish settlements near Jerusalem, an Israeli lawmaker said. The  Greater Jerusalem  legislation would put some settlements in the occupied West Bank, built on land Palestinians seek for a future state and viewed as illegal by most countries, under the jurisdiction of Jerusalem s municipality. The bill, proposed by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s right-wing Likud party, was to have been submitted for approval on Sunday to a ministerial committee on legislation, a first step before a series of ratification votes in parliament. But Likud lawmaker David Bitan, chairman of Netanyahu s coalition in parliament, said a vote by the cabinet committee would be delayed because Washington told Israel the bill s passage could impede U.S. efforts to revive peace talks that collapsed in 2014.  There is American pressure that claims this is about annexation and that this could interfere with the peace process,  Bitan told Army Radio.  The prime minister doesn t think this is about annexation. I don t think so either. We have to take the time to clarify matters to the Americans. Therefore, if the bill passes in a week, or in a month, it s less problematic,  he said. Proponents of the legislation say it falls short of formal land annexation to Israel but will enable some 150,000 settlers to vote in Jerusalem city elections. Intelligence Minister Israel Katz, a supporter of the bill, has said this would  ensure a Jewish majority in a united Jerusalem . Israel s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector it captured along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a 1967 Middle East war, has not won international recognition. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli media reports said the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, had conveyed misgivings about the legislation, under which the large Maale Adumim and Beitar Illit settlements would become part of a Greater Jerusalem municipality. Israel s Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as telling cabinet ministers on Sunday:  The Americans turned to us and inquired what the bill was all about. As we have been coordinating with them until now, it is worth continuing to talk and coordinate with them.  A U.S. embassy spokeswoman declined immediate comment. Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians. Israel disputes that its settlements are illegal, citing  historical, Biblical and political links to the territory, as well as security considerations. ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Icelandic voters give center-left opposition narrow win in parliament,"(Reuters) - Icelanders voted in favor of a left-leaning four-party coalition in parliamentary elections, a final vote count showed Sunday, although it remained unclear who would get a mandate to form the next government. The left-leaning coalition of the Left-Green Movement, the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party won 32 seats in the 63-member parliament, the narrowest possible majority, polls published by state broadcaster RUV showed. The Independence Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, remained the biggest party with 25 percent of the votes but suffered a setback.  It was clear that the vote meant the ousting of his center-right government after a scandal involving the prime minister s father. President Gudni Johannesson has yet to hand the mandate to the party that will be tasked with forming the next government. The president normally gives the mandate to the head of the biggest party.

'Not unrealistic' for Catalan leader to get asylum in Belgium: minister,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Granting Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont political asylum in Belgium would be  not unrealistic  if he asks for it, the Belgian migration minister said, underlining his country s position as a contrarian voice in the Spanish standoff. The Madrid government sacked the Catalan leader and dismissed the region s parliament on Friday, hours after it declared itself an independent nation [nL8N1N280L]. Spain s constitutional court has also started a review of Catalonia s independence vote for prosecutors to decide if it constituted rebellion. While there was no indication Puigdemont was hoping to come to Belgium, the country is one of few members of the European Union where EU citizens can ask for political asylum.   It is not unrealistic if you look at the situation,  Belgium s migration minister, Theo Francken, told Belgian broadcaster VTM.  They are already talking about a prison sentence,  Francken, a member of Flemish nationalist party N-VA, said.  The question is to what extent he would get a fair trial.  It would be difficult for Spain to extradite Puigdemont in such a case, he said. While most European leaders have refrained from commenting on the Spanish crisis, saying it was an internal matter and the country s constitution should prevail, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called for dialogue between Madrid and Barcelona[nL8N1MD34Z]. Michel, a centrist from French-speaking Wallonia, has governed in coalition with the N-VA since 2014, a period during which the party toned down its calls for more independence for Belgium s Dutch-speaking North. The relationship between Belgium and Spain soured over a similar issue in the 1990s and 2000s, when the country refused to extradite a Spanish couple wanted over alleged involvement with the Basque militant group ETA.

Australian former governor-general and peacemaker Ninian Stephen dies at 94,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Former Australian Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen, who worked on the Northern Ireland peace talks and served on the International Court of Justice, died on Sunday. He was 94. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced plans for a state funeral, saying there were very few honors that Stephen, who held five separate knighthoods, didn t have to his name.  Australia will remember Sir Ninian for his humility, his intellect, and his lifelong commitment to justice and the rule of law,  Turnbull said. Stephen served as governor-general from 1982 to 1989 when he became the first Australian Ambassador for the Environment, working hard to ban mining in Antarctica. He was born in Britain and moved to Australia in his late teens where he studied law before serving as an infantryman during World War Two, serving in New Guinea and Borneo. Both the British and Irish governments chose Stephen to chair the second phase of the Northern Ireland peace talks in 1992. He was also a judge for the International Criminal Tribunal investigating war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. In his later years, he advised on South Africa s constitution, worked for the International Labour Organisation in Burma and was involved in setting up a tribunal to hear cases involving atrocities committed by the genocidal Khmer Rouge  killing fields  regime of 1975-79. He also helped draft a constitution for Afghanistan after the 2001 ouster of the Taliban.  ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Australia's Queensland calls snap election in test for far-right candidates,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s Queensland state on Sunday called a snap election after the ruling center-left Labor Party lost its legislative majority, a poll that could give far-right nationalists a chance to boost political representation. State Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk called the election for Nov. 25 after her party expelled a rogue lawmaker over misconduct on Friday, which left her with a hung parliament alongside the conservative Liberal National Party (LNP).  I m calling this election to give business and industry in our great state the certainty they need as we approach 2018,  Palaszczuk told reporters in Brisbane. The campaign launch comes just days after a citizenship scandal engulfed federal politics when the High Court ruled that Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and four other lawmakers were ineligible to remain in parliament because they held dual citizenship.   One Nation, a party founded by far-right politician Pauline Hanson who holds a seat in the federal Senate, has already flagged plans to field candidates across at least two-thirds of the constituencies represented in Queensland s unicameral parliament. One of the disqualified federal lawmakers from Friday s High Court ruling, One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts, said after his dismissal that he intends to stand for the party in the Queensland election. A Newspoll published by SBS News earlier this month showed One Nation at 16 percent primary support in Queensland, likely stealing some voters from the LNP s traditional electorates.  One Nation s state leader, Steve Dickson, said on Sunday the party would field 60 candidates across the 93 seats of the Queensland parliament, and could add more.  Maths says clearly we ll get the balance of power in Queensland,  Dickson told Sky News, adding that his party was riding a global backlash against establishment political parties. However, some political analysts caution against high expectations for One Nation, pointing to the Western Australia state election results in March where the party failed to secure an expected swing in political influence.   Palaszczuk s press briefing on Sunday was briefly interrupted by protestors against Indian mining giant Adani Enterprises  proposed $4 billion Carmichael coal mine in the state s north, which could shape up to be a significant campaign topic. Opposition to Adani s Carmichael mine could give a boost to minority groups such as the Greens, an environmentalist party, and One Nation, which opposes foreign investment. Environment groups say the mine would contribute to global warming and damage the Great Barrier Reef. Adani says the project would pay billions of dollars in royalties and taxes, create jobs and export coal to India help bring electricity to rural regions. The LNP supports the mine but is considering plans to ensure Adani s corporate structure makes its tax liability similar to Australian companies before it is given a proposed A$1 billion loan from the federal government.

Deputy governor of Afghan province kidnapped in Pakistan,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Unidentified kidnappers bundled the deputy governor of Afghanistan s northwestern province of Kunar into a car in the Pakistani city of Peshawar and took him away, police sources said on Sunday. Mohammad Nabi Ahmadi had crossed over from Afghanistan into Pakistan with his brother and was walking down a road in the northwestern city of Peshawar when a car with tinted windows pulled up and overpowered the Afghan official, according to a Peshawar police source. The police source said Ahmadi s brother recounted the episode to Pakistani police, but did not disclose that his brother was a high-ranking Afghan provincial government official.  It was afterwards we came to know from other sources that he was deputy governor of Kunar,  said the police official. Abdul Ghani Musamem, the spokesman for the governor of Kunar, confirmed Ahmadi had gone missing in Peshawar on Friday and added that he had been on leave for medical treatment. Wealthy Afghans frequently cross the border for medical treatment in Pakistan. Many Afghans live in Peshawar and it is also common for influential figures in Afghanistan to have business or family links in the Pashtun regions of Pakistan.  The Pakistani police source said the Afghan government had not told them about Ahmadi s visit, adding that  otherwise we would have provided him with security .  Another security official said police in Peshawar were working to find out if Ahmadi s kidnapping was related to his work or a personal dispute. The Afghan Taliban denied involvement in Ahmadi s kidnapping.  We heard that a deputy Afghan governor went missing in Pakistan but let me clarify that we don t operate outside Afghanistan,  said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.  In Pakistan, our leadership has strictly forbidden our people from any sort of activities as this is not our policy.   ",worldnews,"October 29, 2017 ",1
Xi ally Li Qiang named Shanghai party boss: Xinhua,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Li Qiang, an ally of Chinese President Xi Jinping, has been named the top Communist Party official in Shanghai, replacing Han Zheng who last week joined the elite Politburo Standing Committee, the official Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.  Xi on Wednesday unveiled a new senior leadership at the end of the twice-a-decade congress, with new members appointed to the three elite party bodies that run China.   Over the next few weeks and months, a series of other reshuffles will take place as the party moves people into new party and government positions and as others retire. Xinhua said in a brief notice that Li, 58, would take up the party secretary post in Shanghai and no longer serve in the top spot in Jiangsu province, according to a  decision of the Central Committee , which at 204 members is the largest of the party s ruling bodies.  The move puts Xi allies in China s four major municipalities - Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing - power centers on par administratively to provinces.  A native of the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang, Li was secretary general of the provincial party committee under Xi when the latter was Zhejiang party boss from 2002 to 2007. Li was appointed to the 25-member Politburo, which is under the Standing Committee, on Wednesday, and Reuters  sources had tipped him to take on the Shanghai job. [nL4N1N3052]  He is seen as a strong contender to be further promoted to the Standing Committee at the next congress in 2022. Xinhua also said that another known Xi ally, Lou Qinjian, replaced Li as Jiangsu party secretary, stepping down as party boss in Xi s home province of Shaanxi, a post in turn filled by Hu Heping.

Taiwan president arrives in Hawaii despite Chinese objections,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen landed in Honolulu on Saturday en route to the island s diplomatic allies among Pacific nations and set off for a visit to a Pearl Harbor memorial, despite strong objections to the visit from China. China regards self-ruled Taiwan as sovereign territory and regularly calls it the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States, complaining to Washington about transit stops by Taiwanese presidents. China has not renounced the possible use of force to bring the island under its control. Tsai, who China believes is seeking formal independence for Taiwan, left on Saturday on a week-long trip to three Pacific island allies - Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands - via Honolulu and the U.S. territory of Guam. For her part, Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s democracy and security. Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department said Tsai s transits through U.S. soil would be  private and unofficial  and were based on long-standing U.S. practice consistent with  our unofficial relations with Taiwan .  It noted there was  no change to the U.S. one-China policy  which recognizes that Beijing takes the view that there is only one China, and Taiwan is part of it.    Tsai, accompanied by her entourage and members of the media, left on a short boat ride for the USS Arizona Memorial, which is built over the remains of the battleship sunk in Pearl Harbor in the Second World War, on Saturday afternoon. The memorial, where Tsai was expected to lay a wreath, now forms a centerpiece of the World War Two Valor in the Pacific National Monument, a site administered by the National Park Service.  U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit China in less than two weeks. He angered Beijing last December by taking a telephone call from Tsai shortly after he won the presidential election. The trip to the United States is Tsai s second this year. In January she stopped over in Houston and San Francisco on her way to and from Latin America, visiting the headquarters of Twitter, which is blocked in China. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since 1949, when  Mao Zedong s Communist forces won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek s Nationalists fled to the island.

Cuba to make it easier for Cuban Americans to visit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cuba will make it easier for its U.S.-based citizens to travel to the island, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Saturday, in a gesture to win support from Cuban Americans during a diplomatic crisis over allegations of mysterious health attacks.  The U.S. government closes, and Cuba opens,  Rodriguez told a meeting of pro-Havana Cuban Americans in Washington. He said Cuban citizens in the United States would no longer need to have a special review of their Cuban passports to rehabilitate them before traveling to the island.  Rodriguez said that procedure had become more difficult due to staff shortages at the Cuban embassy after the U.S. government expelled 15 Cuban diplomats this month due to the dispute over the mystery attacks on U.S. personnel in Cuba.  It s unacceptable and immoral, from the point of view of the Cuban government, for people to be harmed by a difference between governments,  he said.  Some Cuban Americans said Havana was simply acceding to demands that it should have acceded to long ago, like allowing them home without a special procedure.  While the United States has not formally accused Cuba of carrying out what it says are attacks that have caused hearing loss and cognitive issues in its diplomats, President Donald Trump said last week Havana was responsible. Cuban government officials accused Trump this week of slandering their country. Tension over the alleged attacks, some of which involved high-pitched sounds, came after Trump said in June he wanted to partially roll back the historic detente between the United States and Cuba, ordering tighter restrictions on travel and trade. These have yet to be unveiled. Rodriguez said Cuba was making it easier for the children of Cubans in the United States to attain Cuban nationality and allowing Cuban Americans to travel to the country on cruise ships that embark at two ports on Cuba. Havana will also allow some Cubans who left the country illegally to return, he said.             There are roughly 2 million Cubans or Americans of Cuban origin in the United States. One attendee at the event, Andres Pertierra, a U.S.-born citizen with a Cuban father, said he was excited he now qualified for a Cuban passport.   These changes inspire gratitude and bring Cubans abroad closer to Cuban government,  said the legal assistant.  The Cuban government is making sure that it is clear that the weight of responsibility for failure to normalize falls squarely on the shoulders of the Trump administration.

"Climate, migration disputes cloud German coalition talks","BERLIN (Reuters) - Disputes about climate and immigration policy dominated German media ahead of resumed talks among Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmental Greens about forming a coalition government. Officials from all three political groups traded barbs and insults in a series of media interviews, dimming hopes that next week s talks could result in progress for a so-called Jamaica coalition - a name chosen because the parties  black, yellow and green colors mirror those of the Jamaican flag. Simone Peter, co-leader of the Greens, told Reuters the FDP must agree to honor existing carbon dioxide reduction promises before her party would continue coalition talks. She said her party viewed conservative s insistence on a migrant cap as a  no go . FDP Leader Christian Lindner shot back in an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper:  If the Greens don t budge in future talks, Jamaica will remain a castle in the air.  Merkel, whose conservative alliance suffered its worst result in September elections since 1949, is trying to forge a tricky three-way coalition that is untested at a national level. The exploratory talks are to continue Monday after the three sides failed to reach agreement on immigration and climate issues during an 11-hour session on Thursday. A new poll for Bild am Sonntag newspaper showed support for conservatives down one percentage point to 31 percent - its lowest level this year - while support for the Greens and FDP was unchanged at 10 percent and 11 percent. Peter told Reuters it was nonsense to continue talks unless the FDP committed to a 2007 pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020.  Before exploratory talks continue, the FDP must accept unconditionally the climate protection goals,  Peter told Reuters in an interview.  Otherwise the talks make no sense.  Deputy FDP leader Wolfgang Kubicki told the RND newspaper chain on Friday that no agreement was possible if the Greens insisted on sticking to that target. Lindner blasted the Greens   maximum demands  for ending coal production and giving refugees unlimited rights to bring their families to Germany. He told the Bild am Sonntag such actions would only boost support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which parlayed public frustration to win 12.6 percent of the vote in September. Alexander Dobrindt, a top negotiator for the Bavarian sister party of Merkel s conservatives, told the paper that building a coalition would be  more than difficult  unless the Greens modified their position rejecting limits on migration. Many conservatives want to take a harder line on immigration, blaming the election setback on Merkel s decision to allow in more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016. They insist that an agreement by Merkel s CDU and the CSU on guidelines that would limit annual refugee numbers must form the basis of any coalition accord. The Greens reject such a cap. The right to asylum is guaranteed under Germany s constitution. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Bombs kill at least 17 people in Somali capital Mogadishu,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Two car bombs killed at least 17 people in Somalia s capital Mogadishu on Saturday, police said, two weeks after a huge truck bomb killed hundreds of civilians in the city. Islamist group al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attacks on Saturday. A suicide car bomb was rammed into a hotel, Nasahablod Two, about 600 meters from the presidential palace, and then armed militants stormed the building, police said.  A few minutes later, a car bomb exploded near the former parliament house nearby.  Ali Nur, a police officer, told Reuters 17 people, mostly policemen, had died in the blasts.  Security forces have entered a small portion of the hotel building ... the exchange of gunfire is hellish,  he said.  The police personnel who died had been stationed close to hotel s gate. The dead also included a former lawmaker, he said. Fighting continued to rage inside the hotel after the blast and police said the death toll was likely to rise. Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, told Reuters the emergency service had carried 17 people injured from the hotel bombing.  A huge cloud of smoke rose over the scene and a Reuters witness saw over a dozen wrecked cars and bloodstains in front of the hotel. Sporadic gunfire could be heard. Islamist group al Shabaab, responsible for scores of such attacks in the country s long civil war, said it carried out Saturday s bombings.    We targeted ministers and security officials who were inside the hotel. We are fighting inside,  Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group s military operations spokesman, told Reuters. He said the hotel belonged to Somalia s internal security minister, Mohamed Abukar Islow. Al Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia s internationally-backed government and impose its strict interpretation of Islam s sharia law.  Bombs in Mogadishu two weeks ago killed at least 358 people, the worst such attacks in the country s history, igniting nationwide outrage. Another 56 people are still missing, believed to have been burnt without a trace. Al Shabaab was widely suspected, but has not claimed responsibility after thousands of Somalis poured onto the streets to protest.  Al Shabaab s attacks are growing in frequency and size, as a 22,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force prepares to begin withdrawing.  In 2016, 723 people died in 395 bomb attacks in Somalia, according to a report produced earlier this year by Nairobi-based think tank Sahan Research. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
'Margaret Thatcher is my role model': German far-right AfD leader,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Alice Weidel, a leader of Germany s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, said the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is her political role model, saying Thatcher got Britain back on its feet when it was facing economic ruin. Weidel told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag newspaper that her party, which stormed into parliament for the first time after capturing nearly 13 percent of the vote, aimed to be ready to join a coalition government by 2021. That could be a long shot since all mainstream parties have rejected working with the AfD. Weidel said the party was content serving in opposition now, but its long-term goal was to shape policy, and Thatcher s experience in Britain was a helpful guide.  Margaret Thatcher is my political role model,  Weidel told the newspaper, lauding the U.K. leader s willingness to swim against the current when necessary.  Thatcher took over Great Britain when the country was economically in the dumps and built it up again.  Weidel, a lesbian, said her partner and two adopted sons would move to Berlin from Switzerland when the partner s current film project was completed.  She said only 18 percent of the AfD s voters were women which was  way too few  and the party needed to attract more women voters. She said she favoured free child care and kindergartens because that would help families. Weidel also urged former AfD leader Frauke Petry to give up her seat in parliament after quitting the party the day after the election and vowing to sit as an independent.   I don t have any animosity,  Weidel said.  I think it s a shame that she left the AfD. I consider it the wrong decision.  Petry this month kicked off a new  Blue Party , promising a  reasonable conservative  agenda and berating AfD leaders for holding views too far outside the mainstream.

Egypt announces reshuffle in top security ranks,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi appointed a new armed forces chief of staff on Saturday, and the interior ministry dismissed several high-ranking officials in an apparent reorganization of the country s security command. No reason was given for the reshuffle, but the interior ministry decision came a week after a deadly attack on a police operation in a western desert area of Giza Province, in which the ministry said 16 police were killed after coming under heavy fire. Egyptian forces have been fighting several armed Islamist groups, mostly in the northern part of the Sinai peninsula, since Sisi helped lead the military overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. Hundreds of members of the security forces have been killed in attacks by militants in recent years. A local Islamic State affiliate has been the main foe of the security forces in the north Sinai.   A statement from the presidency said Gen. Mohamed Farid Hegazy would replace Gen. Mahmoud Hegazy, who has been made the president s adviser for strategic planning and crisis management.  In a separate statement, the interior ministry announced that it had replaced several high-ranking officials, including the head of homeland security, assistant to the minister for security in Giza province, the director of Giza s security and director of operations for central security.  It gave no further details on the shakeup. No militant group has yet claimed responsibility for last week s attack on the police in a remote desert area of Giza, about 130 km (80 miles) southwest of the capital Cairo.     Thirteen militants were killed in a raid on a farm hideout in the region on Friday. State news agency MENA quoted a security official as saying it was  revenge for the blood of the men who were martyred last week in the oasis . The vast western desert region has always been a security headache with arms flowing across the frontier with Libya, where militant groups have found shelter since the country fell into chaos after the 2011 end of Muammar Gaddafi s rule. Sisi is a former military commander elected by a landslide in 2014 and presents himself as a bulwark against Islamist militancy. He is widely expected to run for re-election next year.

"In edgy Kenyan slum, a rumor ends in fires and a death","NAIROBI (Reuters) - It all started with a rumor: the Mungiki, a dreaded Kikuyu tribal militia, had infiltrated Nairobi s Kawangware slum. Within minutes, local men already fired up by Kenya s divisive election had grabbed machetes and sticks to defend their turf. By the end of Friday night s confrontation, a man had been beaten to death and rows of shops and homes set alight, a worrying taste of how quickly ethnic violence can erupt in the Kenyan capital s volatile slums. Almost all the 50 deaths since August s presidential vote have been in clashes between protesters and police. The deeper fear of Kenyans is that the months of political strife, exacerbated by the courts annulling the August vote, eat away at deep tribal divisions and ignite a wave of inter-ethnic violence, as happened after a disputed 2007 vote when 1,200 people were killed. The Kawangware fighting was sparked by rumors that Kikuyu, the tribe of President Uhuru Kenyatta, had drafted in members of the Mungiki to protect them from opposition supporters.  On Friday, a Reuters witness saw a group of men armed with machetes, known locally as pangas, on the streets of Kawangware. Their identity was unclear, although several residents said they were Mungiki, brought in after opposition loyalists burnt down a prominent Kikuyu-owned business the previous night. The Mungiki, notorious for castrating and decapitating victims, were blamed for hundreds of deaths in the 2007 clashes. Their relative quiet since has not diminished their reputation.  They were more than a hundred, and they were carrying all new pangas,  Vitalis Aloyi, a Kawangware resident, said. Another man said residents had to act to defend themselves.  We had to teach them not to bring Mungiki here. If they bring Mungiki, we will destroy their property and their lives,  said Kennedy Ochieng, an ethnic Luo, like opposition leader Raila Odinga. As the pro-Odinga vigilantes, also armed with clubs and machetes, swept down the muddy street they set fire to Kikuyu businesses suspected of hiding Mungiki militiamen, Ochieng said. One man was killed, and his body burned, leaving a charred spot on the road. Some Odinga supporters denounced him as Mungiki, but no one could explain how they knew. The next day, with smoke still rising from the twisted wreckage of homes and shops, the remaining traders in Kawangware began loading their wares of pipes, popcorn machines and meat onto trucks.  All the other tribes are against the Kikuyu here because of the voting,  said Stephen Kamau, whose fruit stall was burned down.  These people will come back and burn more.  Others in the district, long home to mixed communities, said the truth was more nuanced. As political tensions rose, some businesses had hired local youths for protection, said Rhoda Kungu, a market trader. She insisted the vigilantes were not Mungiki.  We are all brothers and sisters. We just want to live in peace,  she said.  Another trader, Brian Njenga, said it may merely have been pro-Odinga youths spotting a chance to enrich themselves, demanding protection money or looting businesses before they burned them.  Some people are just using this situation to get personal benefit,  Njenga said to somber nods from a crowd of youths around him.  Many have not worked for a long time because the economy is very down.  A few hundred meters down the rubbish-strewn road, hundreds of young men milled around on street corners. Teargas from the night before lingered in the air.  We want to kill Mungiki. They must know this is our territory,  one man shouted.  Don t think because it is quiet now that we are at peace. We are just waiting for something!  ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Iraqi Kurdistan leader Barzani will hand over presidential powers on November 1,"SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdistan s veteran leader Masoud Barzani will not extend his presidential term beyond Nov. 1, a Kurdish government official said on Saturday. His decision came just weeks after a referendum on Kurdish independence backfired and triggered a crisis for Iraq s Kurds who had been enjoying a period of unprecedented autonomy. A plan to divide up the president s powers was outlined in a letter Barzani sent to the Kurdish parliament on Saturday, the official told Reuters. The plan asks parliament to distribute the president s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani s current term was set to expire in four days, the same date that presidential and parliamentary elections were due to be held. However, those elections were delayed indefinitely last week, amidst an escalating regional crisis. Critics say the Sept. 25 independence referendum, orchestrated and championed by the 71-year-old Barzani, has left a bleak outlook for Iraq s Kurds.  Less than four weeks after Kurds in the region voted overwhelmingly to break away from Iraq, the central government launched a military offensive to wrest back the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds regard as both their spiritual homeland, and a key source of revenue for their would-be independent state. It was one of several retaliatory measures taken by Baghdad, which vehemently opposed the referendum.  In a matter of days the Iraqi government has transformed the balance of power in the north of the country, exerting tremendous pressure on Barzani to step aside and wrecking decades-old dreams of Kurdish independence. Iraqi forces have continued to advance on all Kurdish-held territory outside the autonomous region s borders.  Iraq s prime minister demanded on Thursday that Kurds declare their independence referendum void, rejecting the Kurdish autonomous region s offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. Earlier this year, Barzani said he did not intend to stand in the November elections. However, prior to the referendum, few expected he would stick to his promise.  Barzani has held the office of the presidency since 2005. The region last held a presidential election in 2009, in which Barzani won. His term of office expired in 2013 and was extended twice.     The president is expected to address his people before his term formally expires, marking the end of a storied career. Barzani was born in 1946, soon after his legendary father, Mulla Mustafa, founded a party to fight for the rights of Iraq s Kurds. After decades spent fighting with the Peshmerga, Barzani became a central figure in the drive to create an autonomous Kurdish state in northern Iraq, after Saddam Hussein was toppled in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.     Barzani s letter will be discussed by parliament on Sunday, though the government official said it was unclear whether ministers would need to vote the plan into action during the session.

Libyan forces order investigation into bodies found near Benghazi,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - The head of the eastern-based Libyan National Army ordered an investigation on Saturday into the case of 36 unidentified bodies found near Benghazi two days earlier. A statement signed by Khalifa Haftar said the investigation would try to identify the victims and find out whether they had been held in authorized prisons. It would also aim to identify, arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of the crime. The finding of the bodies on Thursday night in Al-Abyar, about 70 km (45 miles) east of Benghazi, was the latest in a series of discoveries of corpses, some showing signs of torture and gunshot wounds, on territory controlled by the LNA. Previously, security sources had put the number of bodies at 37. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
German far-right party drops bid for journalists' private data,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Saturday dropped a controversial bid for data on the ethnic backgrounds and private views of journalists after concerns surfaced about its registration form for a party congress. The party s initial registration form had sparked sharp criticism on Friday from the German Journalists Association, and prompted an investigation by the Berlin data protection office. The party, which rails against what it calls the  Islamisation of Europe  and  fake news  coverage by mainstream news outlets, became the third largest force in the German Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, in Sept. 24 elections. AfD officials had declined to comment to the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper, which first reported the issue on Friday, and did not respond to a request for comment by Reuters. However the party s spokesman downplayed controversy about the issue in a posting on Twitter on Saturday.  Test version deleted. Starting immediately journalists can use the official registration form on our website,  AfD spokesman Christian Lueth wrote on Twitter. The initial media version had asked journalists to check a box in which they agreed to the collection, storage and use of personal data provided, such as name, medium and press pass number, as well as  special data . The form referenced a section in Germany s data protection law, which lists such  special data  as including racial and ethnic background, political views, religious or philosophical convictions, union membership, health or sexual orientation. Other parties require basic information for registration of journalists, but do not ask for such personal details.  This is an unacceptable intrusion into the private affairs of journalists,  said Hendrik Zoerner, spokesman for the German Journalists Association.  We call on the AfD to immediately remove the required agreement.  The AfD won nearly 13 percent of vote on Sept. 24, making it the third largest party in the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the first far-right group to move into the legislature in more than half a century.  German civil rights groups are mobilizing to stage a large protest at the start of the party congress in the northern city of Hanover on Dec. 2. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
"Mattis, in Seoul, says U.S. can't accept nuclear North Korea","SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, warning that its rapidly advancing nuclear and missile programs would undermine, not strengthen, its security. Mattis has been at pains during his week-long trip to Asia to stress that diplomacy is America s preferred course, a message he returned to after top-level military talks in Seoul on Saturday and at the tense border area with North Korea on Friday. Still, he warned Pyongyang that its military was no match for the U.S.-South Korean alliance, and that diplomacy was most effective  when backed by credible military force.   Make no mistake - any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated. And any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is both effective and overwhelming,  Mattis said. Mattis s South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Song Young-moo, dismissed the idea of deploying tactical nuclear weapons to the peninsula as a response to the North s advances. But the U.S.-Korean alliance had the ability to respond, even in the event of a nuclear attack from the North, Song added. Tension between North Korea and the United States has been building after a series of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang and bellicose verbal exchanges between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump. The CIA has said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent. Mattis, too, said Kim s behavior had left no room to imagine accepting Pyongyang s nuclear status.   I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States can accept North Korea as a nuclear power,  Mattis told a news conference. Trump - who has threatened to destroy the North if necessary - leaves on his first trip as president to Asia next week, including a stop in South Korea to meet President Moon Jae-in. Moon, after talks with Mattis on Friday, said the  aggressive deployment  of U.S. strategic assets in the region, which have included overflights by U.S. bombers, had been effective in deterring the North Korean threat.   U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the nuclear weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to denuclearize. Mattis suggested, however, that Pyongyang needed to understand that its weapons programs would not strengthen its defenses. The North says it wants a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.   If it remains on its current path of ballistic missiles and atomic bombs, it will be counter-productive,  Mattis said, adding North Korea would be  reducing its security.  Still, any attempt to force the North to denuclearize could have devastating consequences, thanks in part to the large amount of artillery trained on Seoul. During Mattis  trip to the inter-Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Friday, he was briefed on the posture of North Korean artillery.  Defense Minister Song suggested that U.S. and South Korean missile defenses simply could not stop all of the weapons trained on the South.  Defending against this many LRAs (long-range artillery) is infeasible in my opinion,  Song told Mattis at the DMZ, citing a need for strategies to  offensively neutralize  the artillery in the event of a conflict.   Mattis replied:  Understood.  Still, Mattis reaffirmed to reporters in South Korea that military options do exist to deal with the North Korean threat that spare the South s capital, Seoul. Mattis, who has made such assurances in the past, did not disclose what those options were.  ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Pope urges EU to rediscover unity if it wants a future,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in a major speech on Europe, on Saturday urged the European Union to  recover the sense of being a single community  if it wants a future of prosperity and fairness for all. Francis spoke at the end of a two-day conference at the Vatican called  Re-Thinking Europe . Dozens of participants attended, including European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, the vice president of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans, and religious leaders. While the pope did not specifically mention the situation in Catalonia, where the region s leaders want to break away from Spain, or Britain s decision to leave the EU, he spoke often of solidarity, teamwork and mutual sacrifice.  A European Union that, in facing its crises, fails to recover a sense of being a single community that sustains and assists its members   and not just a collection of small interest groups   would miss out not only on one of the greatest challenges of its history, but also on one of the greatest opportunities for its own future,  he said.  Particular and nationalist agendas risk thwarting the courageous dreams of the founders of Europe,  he said. In his long speech, Francis appeared to warn against the dangers to Europe posed by populist anti-immigrant parties. In elections in Germany in September, Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured almost 13 percent of the vote, making it the third largest party and the first far-right party to win seats in more than half a century.  Extremist and populist groups are finding fertile ground in many countries; they make protest the heart of their political message, without offering the alternative of a constructive political project,  Francis said, without naming any group. History s first Latin American pope said politics had often gone astray, saying  Sadly, all too often we see how politics is becoming instead a forum for clashes between opposing forces.  In his address to the pope at the closing ceremony, Tajani, the European Parliament president, spoke of  risk of a return to intolerance and xenophobia . The pope called for immigrants to be welcomed to Europe as an enriching resource, rather than be seen as a threat. But, in an apparent assertion that immigration had to be controlled, he said that while authorities should have an  open heart  they should be able to  provide for the full integration, on the social, economic and political level  of newcomers.

Sacked Catalonia leader calls for opposition to Madrid's rule,"MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Sacked Catalonian president Carles Puigdemont on Saturday called for peaceful  democratic opposition  to the central government s takeover of the region following its unilateral declaration of independence from Spain. Puigdemont, whose regional government was dismissed by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday, accused Madrid of  premeditated aggression  against the will of the Catalans. Rajoy removed Puigdemont, took over the administration of the autonomous region and called a new election after Catalonia s parliament declared itself an independent nation on Friday. The bold if to all appearances futile action marked a potentially dangerous escalation of Spain s worst political crisis in the four decades since its return to democracy.  It s very clear that the best form of defending the gains made up until now is democratic opposition to Article 155,  Puigdemont said in a brief statement he read out in the Catalan city of Girona, referring to the legal trigger for the takeover. But he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as the national authorities are already moving into Barcelona and other parts of Catalonia to enforce control. Spanish government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said it  would welcome Puigdemont s participation in the regional elections it has called for Dec. 21.  I m quite sure that if Puigdemont takes part in these elections, he can exercise this democratic opposition,  Mendez de Vigo told Reuters TV in an interview. European countries, the United States and Mexico have rejected the Catalan declaration and expressed support for Spain s unity. Puigdemont signed the statement as President of Catalonia, demonstrating he did not accept his ousting.   We continue persevering in the only attitude that can make us winners. Without violence, without insults... and also respecting the protests of the Catalans who do not agree with what the parliamentary majority has decided,  he said. The secessionists say a referendum on Oct. 1 gave them a mandate for independence. However, less than half of eligible voters turned out for the ballot, which Madrid declared illegal and tried to stop. Opinion polls show that more than half of the 5.3 million people eligible to vote in the wealthy northeastern region, which is already autonomous, do not want to break from Spain.  But emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for Madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule.  Calling a new regional election is something of a gamble by  Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as it could increase the numbers of pro-independence supporters in a new parliament. But Mendez de Vigo said it would give Catalans the final say about how they felt. Asked what would happen if Puigdemont had to face prosecution, Mendez de Vigo said judicial and political powers were separate in Spain and that  no one is above the law.  He did not comment further.   Catalonia s police force told its officers to stay neutral, a step towards averting possible conflict following doubts over how the Mossos d Esquadra, as they are called, would respond if ordered to evict Puigdemont and his government.  The force is riven by distrust between those for and against independence and also estranged from Spain s national police forces, Mossos and national officers have told Reuters. Some Catalan officers stood between national police and those trying to vote during the referendum.   Given that there is it is likely to be an increase in gatherings and rallies of citizens... and that there are people of different thoughts, we must remember that it is our responsibility to guarantee the security of all and help these to take place without incident,  an internal memo said. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said. The Madrid government also sacked the Mossos  chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, who became a hero to the secessionists after his force took a much softer stance than national police in enforcing the referendum ban. Spain s High Court barred Trapero from leaving the country and seized his passport as part of an investigation for alleged sedition, although it has not ordered his arrest.  In Barcelona, thousands of independence supporters packed the Sant Jaume Square in front of the regional headquarters on Friday night, waving Catalan flags and singing traditional songs in the Catalan language as bands played. But there was no trouble overnight and the streets were quiet on Saturday.  The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, has urged civil servants not to follow orders from the Spanish government and to mount  peaceful resistance  while a pro-independence trade union, the CSC, called a strike. The government said it would ensure a minimum service. About 1,000 people took part in a pro-unity rally in Madrid on Saturday and others turned out in the northern city of Valladolid   an indication of the resentment the independence drive has caused in the rest of Spain. Aitor Sanchez, a 30-year-old worker, said he was saddened  the government had taken control of Catalonia but it had no choice.  These are delicate moments in our country. But I believe we must respect the law.  The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain s economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Tourism in hugely popular Barcelona has been hit, and markets have shown signs of concern. European leaders have also denounced the push, fearing it could fan separatist sentiment around the continent. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Madrid calls on Puigdemont to participate in Catalan elections,"MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government said on Saturday it would welcome the participation of sacked Catalan president Carles Puigdemont in regional elections to be held in December. Government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo told Reuters TV in an interview that if Puigdemont wanted to continue in politics,  which is his right, I think he should prepare for next elections . Puigdemont had earlier on Saturday called for a democratic opposition to Madrid s takeover of the region following its declaration of independence.  I m quite sure that if Puigdemont takes part in these elections, he can exercise this democratic opposition . After dissolving the regional parliament and sacking the regional government on Friday, Spain s Prime Minister Rajoy said a new regional election would be held in Catalonia on Dec. 21. Mendez de Vigo also said he was confident that the regional Catalan police would obey the law after the government had sacked regional officers. He said that if Puigdemont refused to abandon his office, the government would react with  intelligence and with common sense . Asked what would happen if Puigdemont had to face prosecution in the courts, Mendez replied that in Spain judicial and political powers were separate and that  no one is above the law.  He did not commit himself further.   ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Big role for U.S. at climate talks despite withdrawal from Paris deal,"OSLO/LONDON (Reuters) - The United States will play a big role at global talks next month on shaping the Paris agreement on climate change, to the dismay of some nations that want Washington sidelined because of President Donald Trump s plan to withdraw from the deal. U.S. officials have said they will be constructive at the annual 195-nation climate meeting in Bonn, Germany, from Nov. 6-17 to work on a  rule book  for the 2015 Paris plan to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century. But other nations are torn between welcoming or berating Washington s envoys after Trump s decided in June to pull out and instead promote the U.S. fossil fuel industry. Washington retains its place in the talks because the Paris pact stipulates that no country can formally pull out before November 2020.  The Trump regime really needs to walk away and not hold the rest of the world hostage to the President s ineptitude,  said Ian Fry, who represents Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific island nation at risk of rising sea levels and storm surges. He told Reuters that Trump s pro-coal policies, and doubts that climate change is caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions, could undermine urgency at the meeting of senior officials and environment ministers. The White House did not respond to requests for comment and the State Department has not set up a briefing ahead of the meeting, as it traditionally has. This year is on track to be the second warmest since records began in the 19th century, behind 2016. Scientists say rising temperatures will stoke ever more powerful hurricanes, floods and wildfires. But U.S. delegates at preparatory meetings said they will play a positive role in Bonn, said Nazhat Shameem Khan, chief negotiator of Fiji which will preside at the meeting. The U.S. approach  send positive signals ... that this will not be a destructive COP,  she said, using the shorthand for Conference of the Parties. It is not yet clear if any U.S. political leaders will attend.  Many U.S. allies, including France, Canada and Britain, hope to coax Trump to end up staying in the pact which is backed by all nations except Syria. Nicaragua, which had judged the deal too weak, ratified it this month. In a sign that most nations are willing to permit a strong U.S. role, an internal U.N. document obtained by Reuters shows that a U.S. official, Andrew Rakestraw, will co-lead a section of the talks with a Chinese counterpart on ensuring transparent rules for the Paris agreement. And the U.S. delegation will be led by Thomas Shannon, a career diplomat who gave a speech in 2015 calling climate change  one of the world s greatest challenges .  The meeting will work on a rule book, due to be completed in 2018, for implementing the Paris agreement on issues such as the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and how national emissions will be checked. Washington and many other developed nations have long sought tough rules to bind emerging nations such as China and India, which have been wary of outside oversight.  And many delegates expect the U.S. officials, many of whom were architects of the Paris accord under former President Barack Obama, will contribute to clear, enforceable rules that will be in U.S. interests whether it is in or out of the deal.  Having the United States at the table with good negotiators who can take this forward is a win-win,  said Paula Caballero, a director of the World Resources Institute think-tank and formerly a climate negotiator for Colombia. The treatment of the United States is likely to hinge on whether Washington limits itself to technical details of the rule book or promotes Trump s pro-coal political agenda.  It is quite likely that the U.S. will be sidelined ... unless they play a constructive role,  said Elisa de Wit, head of climate change at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. Outside the conference center, a U.S. network called  We Are Still In  will highlight actions by states, cities and other non-federal groups to implement the Paris agreement and shift to wind, solar and other clean energies. It says Trump s pro-coal policies will be only a blip in a long-term economic shift this century.  We need to make sure the world maintains confidence in our ability to move forward,  said Washington State Governor Jay Inslee.  ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Greek police arrest suspect behind high-profile parcel bomb attacks,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek police said on Saturday they arrested a man they believe was involved in mailing parcel and letter bombs to targets including ex-Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos and former German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. In March, police intercepted eight suspect packages at an Athens sorting office after the dispatch of booby-trapped parcels to the International Monetary Fund in Paris and the German Finance Ministry in Berlin. One parcel, mailed to Schaeuble, was intercepted by the ministry s mail department. A letter addressed to the IMF exploded, slightly hurting an administrative assistant.  The anti-terrorism service arrested a 29-year-old male following a warrant ... related to parcel bomb dispatches,  police said in a statement. Police searched the suspect s apartment in Athens and found two pistols, bullets, a timing device and explosive materials in travel bags, a police official said.  Police had spotted him in videos bringing parcels to the post office on five different occasions,  the official said, declining to be named. Papademos was injured in May when a booby-trapped package exploded in his car in central Athens, in the worst act of violence against Greek politicians country for several years. The suspect denies involvement in the attacks and in the militant group Conspiracy of Fire Cells, which claimed responsibility for the parcel sent to the German Finance Ministry, the police official told Reuters. Conspiracy of Fire Cells, one in a long line of violent anti-establishment groups in Greece, initially specialized in arson attacks but turned to bombings in May 2009.

U.S. hopes for more from Russia after Crimean prisoners freed,"KIEV (Reuters) - The release of two Crimean Tatars from Russian custody this week was a good sign and hopefully means Russia will take positive steps in eastern Ukraine as well, the U.S. special envoy to the Ukraine peace talks said on Saturday. Ukraine and Russia are at loggerheads over Russia s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and support for separatists in the Donbass region in a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people despite a notional ceasefire.  Russia unexpectedly released a pair of Tatar activists on Wednesday thanks partly to an intervention by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. They have vowed to return to Crimea to campaign for the release of other prisoners.  The fact that they were released is a small positive sign,  Kurt Volker told Reuters on a visit to Kiev, where he met the freed men.  It s the kind of thing you hope you could build on that, Russia would build on that with some other steps with the Donbass,  he added.  A former ambassador to NATO, Volker was appointed in July by the Donald Trump administration to help resolve the Donbass conflict, which Washington cites as a key obstacle to better relations between the United States and Russia.  A recent sticking point is whether and how the United Nations should send a peacekeeping force to the region. Volker met Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov in October for talks on this, which he said produced no breakthroughs but were  constructive .  What we are doing, is we are seeing whether we can create some common ideas for how a peacekeeping force could be useful in resolving the conflict,  Volker said, saying the force could only be effective with a stronger mandate than Russia envisages. Russia denies sending its own troops or sophisticated weaponry to helping the separatists.  Volker blamed Russian aggression for the Donbass conflict  but said a realization on Russia s part that the violence is against its interests could spur a change in Moscow s behavior.     The real issue is Russia s decision-making. Until now, Russia has been holding this territory, keeping this conflict alive, hoping that it provides some leverage over Ukraine,  Volker said.  The reality has sunk in I believe that this has actually produced the opposite. It has produced a Ukraine that is more unified, more nationalist, more anti-Russian, more westward-looking than ever existed before.   Volker also said the United States was  actively considering  supplying lethal defensive weapons to Kiev, a prospect that has riled Russia.  No-one has any worry about someone defending themselves unless they are an aggressor, so it should not be that controversial an issue,  Volker said.  ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1

Leftists on cusp of power as weary Icelanders go to polls,"REYKJAVIK (Reuters) - Angry over a string of political scandals, Icelanders may usher a long dominant center-right party out of the exit door in national elections on Saturday, handing power to a charismatic center-left opposition leader. Katr n Jakobsd ttir, 41, of the Left-Green Movement, has campaigned on a platform of restoring trust in government and leveraging an economic boom to increase public spending. With hair slick down, red lipstick, black coat and heels, Jakobsd ttir cast her vote in sunny Reykjavik.  I m feeling very good about today, and I ll have to be optimistic,  she told Reuters after casting her vote. Accompanied by her husband and three sons, she cheerfully took time to mingle with voters, who headed to polls on a   for Iceland   warm autumn day of about 7 Celsius (45 Fahrenheit).  In the second snap parliamentary election in a year, the latest opinion polls showed her trailing Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson s pro-business Independence Party by a small margin. Both parties have polled around 20 percent for most of October. Whichever wins will likely nominate a prime minister who will then be invited to form a coalition government.   I think this will be an exciting election night as there has been a lot of movement in the polls,  Jakobsd ttir said.  We ll be waiting until the morning hours, I won t go to bed until six in the morning.  The Independence Party has been part of every government since 1980, except the coalition that served during the crisis years of 2009-2013, which included the Left-Greens, with Jakobsdottir as education minister.  In her favor this time is the fact that the left-leaning Social Democrats are likely to become the third-biggest party., and that Icelanders appear as primed for change as at any time in recent memory. The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 global financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic turnaround spurred by tourism.  But scandals, a growing sense of inequality and worries over immigration threaten stability in one of the world s most homogeneous nations. Benediktsson has been weakened by fallout from an attempt by his father to vouch for the character of a convicted pedophile. The previous snap election took place late in 2016, after the Panama Papers revelations showed several government figures  involved in an offshore tax haven scandal. That gave a boost to the anti-establishment Pirate Party but its support has since waned. Forming a government this time could take months, as polls show a further five parties winning more than the five percent of votes needed to enter parliament.  I just hope something changes, and there ll be more cooperation,  said Ingunn Erlendsd ttir, 73, a retired ministry employee.  We are only a small nation of just over 300,000, and we need to stand together,  said the pensioner, adding that she has traditionally voted for the right but this time cast her ballot for a left-wing party. Known for her even temper, Jakobsdottir quickly became a popular figure in Iceland after being elected to parliament in 2007, and is one of the few high-profile politicians who have avoided scandal.  Our campaign has been fun, and we ve taken it you could say back to the roots. Walking door to door, having meetings and meeting people in the real world,  she said.  While most parties agree that investment is needed in areas like welfare, infrastructure and tourism, the debate is around how it will be financed. The left-leaning parties, including Jakobsd ttir s, want to finance spending by raising taxes on the wealthy, real estate and the powerful fishing industry.  Having presided over the privatization of banks, financial sector liberalization and the economy s collapse and eventual economic recovery during its several stints in power, the Independence Party has said it wants to fund infrastructure spending by taking money out of the banking sector.

France's Occitanie region calls for Spain and Catalonia peace talks,"PARIS (Reuters) - Spanish and Catalan leaders should open talks as soon as possible to safeguard civil peace, the head of France s Occitanie region, which borders Catalonia, said on Saturday. Madrid on Friday sacked Catalonia s regional government to block its push for independence and called a snap election in the region on Dec. 21 in a bid to draw a line under Spain s worst political crisis in 40 years.   Our region... has a special history with Spain, and we have had close ties with our neighbor Catalonia for decades,  Occitanie president Carole Delga said in a written statement. Occitanie includes the Pyrenees-Orientales, whose territory was part of Catalonia until the signing of a treaty to end a war between France and Spain in 1659. The Catalan language is still spoken by a few people living in the French region.  Faced with this deadlock situation, I want to stress the need to find a way to open talks as soon as possible, notably to safeguard the civil peace,  Delga added.  Occitanie is France s second-biggest region with a total population of more than 5 million people. It was created in January 2016 and comprises two former regions, including the cities of Toulouse and Montpelier. Separately, the nationalist president of the Corsican Assembly, Jean-Guy Talamoni, said on Twitter that he recognized the  birth of the Republic of Catalonia  but called for European authorities to mediate between Madrid and Barcelona.   On the European side, what s troubling is this unfailing support for Madrid, which has used extremely violent means to prevent peaceful people from voting,  Talamoni later said on France Info radio station.  Spain s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy praised the police for carrying out their duties and upholding the law while they attempted to prevent the banned independence referendum taking place.

Yemeni Salafist imam killed in Aden: sources,"ADEN (Reuters) - A Salafist imam was shot dead by gunmen early on Saturday in Aden, southern Yemen, witnesses and local officials said, the third killing of a Salafist imam this month. Sheikh Adel Al Shehri, imam of a mosque in Inmaa district west of Aden, was shot while he was heading to the mosque for morning prayers. No one has claimed responsibility for the three killings and no motive has been made clear, but some of the ultra-conservative Salafists back secession for southern Yemen, and have been a major component of the breakaway southern army. A former Aden governor has declared a council that seeks secession for southern Yemen. A referendum on independence would be announced soon, he said. Aden is also dominated by local forces backed by the United Arab Emirates - a key member of the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen s civil war in 2015 to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power but which are hostile toward Islamists.

British navy sacks nuclear submariners over cocaine use,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s navy has fired nine sailors serving on a nuclear-armed submarine after they tested positive for using cocaine, the country s defense ministry said on Saturday. The crew were from HMS Vigilant, one of four Royal Navy submarines which operate the Trident nuclear missile system.  We do not tolerate drugs misuse by service personnel. Those found to have fallen short of our high standards face being discharged from service,  a Royal Navy spokesman said. The Daily Mail newspaper reported that the sailors had failed drugs tests while the submarine was docked in the United States to pick up nuclear warheads and undergo work, and the sailors had been accommodated in hotels on shore. A defense ministry spokesman declined to comment on the location of the incident but said:  There is no evidence to suggest any individual was under the influence while performing their duties.  The ministry also confirmed the submarine s commander had been relieved of his command pending investigation, but declined to give details.

"Bus plunges into river in Nepal, killing at least 31","KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A bus carrying passengers returning from a Hindu festival to the Nepali capital of Kathmandu skidded off the main highway and plunged into a river on Saturday, killing at least 31 people and leaving others trapped, officials said. The accident occurred around dawn, around 50 km (30 miles) west of the city on the Prithvi Highway that connects Kathmandu with the southern plains.  We have recovered 31 bodies and are looking for more,  government official Ram Mani Mishra told Reuters from the scene.  It s highly unlikely for anyone to survive for so long under water.  Rescuers on rubber boats and police divers managed to spot the bus hours after the crash and were trying to lift it from water with the help of a crane, Mishra said.     Apart from the deaths, 16 people have been injured, government administrator Shyam Prasad Bhandari said. Two with grave injuries were taken to Kathmandu while the rest were treated at a local hospital, he said. Police said survivors were thrown out of the bus windows but another 13 people were still believed to be trapped in the bus. The bus had left Rajbiraj town in the southeastern plains on Friday night. Road accidents are common in mostly mountainous Nepal, where police say about 1,800 people die in crashes every year. Accidents are also blamed on poorly maintained and crowded vehicles.

Myanmar to charge journalists on assignment for Turkish state TV: officials,"NAYPYITAW/YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar police said on Saturday they were preparing to charge journalists working for Turkey s state broadcaster TRT, their local interpreter and driver for bringing a drone into the country without permission. The police were also expecting to obtain court permission to remand the four for up to 15 days as they prepare to charge them under Section 8 of the Export and Import Law. Violators of it can be jailed for up to three years. The journalists - Lau Hon Meng from Singapore and Mok Choy Lin from Malaysia - plus their interpreter Aung Naing Soe and driver Hla Tin have been detained since Friday for flying a drone near the parliament in Myanmar s capital Naypyitaw. The development comes amid tension between Turkey and Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis. In early September, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the death of the Rohingya constituted a  genocide  aimed at Muslim communities in the region, a charge Myanmar denies. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled the majority-Buddhist Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh since security forces responded to Rohingya militants  attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown. Turkish broadcaster TRT said on its website that the network  is in discussions with Myanmar authorities to secure their release. Both journalists had valid visas . Myanmar police spokesman Police Colonel Myo Thu Soe told Reuters the journalists  illegally imported the drone  and all four will be charged under the Export and Import Law. The law does not specifically refer to drones, but it says that  no person shall export or import restricted, prohibited and banned goods,  and that,  without obtaining license, no person shall export or import the specified goods which is to obtain permission.   We are going to the court now to obtain the arraignment, we will get it today,  said Police Lieutenant Tun Tun Win. He said that the remand will be for up to 15 days but police expect to file charges within 10 days. Several journalists in Myanmar have been arrested this year, leading rights groups to warn that the gains made in press freedom since the end of military rule risk being reversed under the administration of national leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The two foreign journalists are detained at police station no. 1 in Naypyitaw, while the two Myanmar nationals have been transferred to a prison in the nearby town of Pyinmana. On Friday night, about 25 police staged an evening raid on the Yangon house of the Myanmar interpreter, well-known domestic reporter Aung Naing Soe, seizing his computer memory sticks and searching documents. Myanmar state broadcaster MRTV said the ministry of foreign affairs had informed the Singaporean and Malaysian embassies about the matter. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
U.S. wants Sahel force strategy before giving money: officials,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - The United States strongly supports an African military force to combat extremist militants in the Sahel region, but needs to see a strategy for the operation before it considers funding, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations and the U.S. Africa commander said. Washington is wary, however, of the 193-member United Nations funding the force - to be made up of troops from Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad and Mauritania - according to Ambassador Nikki Haley and General Thomas Waldhauser. The United States currently funds more than a quarter of the $7.3 billion U.N. peacekeeping budget. Haley said Washington wanted to know  what the strategy would be, how they see this playing out, what s involved in it before we ever commit to U.N.-assessed funding.   Show us something, we re open to it, we re not saying no, but what we re saying right now (is) there literally has been no information that has been given that gives us comfort that they know exactly how this is going to play out,  Haley told reporters on Friday.  The rise of jihadist groups - some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State - in the arid Sahel has alarmed Western powers like France, which has deployed thousands of troops to the region in response. The United States has also been targeting Islamic State in Libya and al-Shabaab in Somalia. But U.S. involvement in counter-terrorism operations in Africa has been under the spotlight since four U.S. Special Forces troops were killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger.    In Africa with all the challenges of the youth bulge, poverty, the lack of governance, wide open spaces, these are areas where violent extremist organizations, like ISIS or like al Qaeda, thrive,  said Waldhauser, who oversees U.S. troops deployed in Africa.  He was speaking to a small group of reporters traveling with Haley on her first African tour as U.S. envoy to the United Nations, visiting Ethiopia, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  United Nations forces don t do counterterrorism, they do peacekeeping operations,  Waldhauser added, reflecting U.S. unease at the United Nations funding the prospective force. The African counter-terrorism force, known as the G5 Sahel, plans to launch its first joint operations in the coming days.  One of the hardest things to do in an organization like that is to try to synchronize the efforts of those five countries and have a coherent strategy as opposed to just a series of engagements in different locations,  Waldhauser said. The United States supported a French-drafted U.N. Security Council resolution in June to give political backing to the G5 Sahel force, but refused to back a formal U.N. mandate.  The 15-member council is due to discuss the force on Monday. Haley said the United States would continue its bilateral support for the G5 countries, but when asked how much Washington was prepared to contribute to the G5 Sahel force, she said:  You will hear about that, coming soon.  Waldhauser said the United States currently makes a total of $51 million in bilateral defense contributions to the G5 countries. French Defense Minister Florence Parly said last week that the United States must step up support for the planned Sahel force or it could fail, leaving French troops to carry the burden. [nL8N1MV58Z] A report to the Security Council by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier this month said that the planned force budget of $490 million for the first year was only 25 percent funded. Waldhauser said the G5 countries had discussed their planned counter-terrorism force with U.S. military officials in May at a U.S. organized defense conference in Germany.  This is exactly what we want to have happen, we want partner nations who share the same overall strategic objectives that we do. We want to try to foster that type of behavior,  he said.

"China's Guangdong gets new party boss, former leader likely to be promoted","BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Saturday appointed a new top official for the southern export powerhouse province of Guangdong, whose former leader sources say is likely to be promoted to a vice premier, part of a reshuffle after the end of a Communist Party Congress. President Xi Jinping on Wednesday unveiled a new senior leadership at the end of the twice-a-decade congress, with new members appointed to the three elite party bodies that run China. Over the next few weeks and months, a series of other reshuffles will take place as the party moves people into new party and government positions and as others retire. In a brief statement, the official Xinhua news agency said that Li Xi had been moved from his post as party boss in the northeastern province of Liaoning to run Guangdong province as its party chief, replacing the incumbent, Hu Chunhua. Guangdong, which borders the former British colony of Hong Kong, is one of China s most economically important provinces. Xinhua did not say what position Hu would assume, but sources with ties to the leadership said he is likely to be promoted to become one of China s vice premiers. Hu, who spent a large part of his career working in restive Tibet, had been considered a candidate for the Standing Committee, the seven-man party body that is China s elite ruling body headed by Xi, but failed to make it on. Three sources with leadership ties told Reuters that Jiangsu party boss Li Qiang is tipped to replace Han Zheng as Shanghai party secretary.  Li is (one of) Xi Jinping s men,  one source said. Li, 58, a native of the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang, was secretary general of the provincial party committee under Xi when the latter was Zhejiang party boss from 2002 to 2007. Li will be a strong contender to be further promoted to the Standing Committee at the next congress in 2022, another source said.  He was appointed to the 25-member Politburo, which is under the Standing Committee, on Wednesday. Former Shanghai leader Han, 63, is likely to become executive or first ranked vice premier next March at the annual meeting of parliament, the sources said.  The State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party s spokesman s office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Spain sacks Catalan government after independence declaration,"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - The Madrid government sacked Catalonia s president and dismissed its parliament on Friday, hours after the region declared itself an independent nation in Spain s gravest political crisis since the return of democracy four decades ago. A new regional election will be held in Catalonia on Dec. 21, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in a televised address on a day of high drama. As well as removing Carles Puigdemont as head of the autonomous region, he also fired its police chief and said central government ministries would take over the Catalan administration.  Spain is living through a sad day,  Rajoy said.  We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf.   As he spoke, thousands of independence supporters packed the Sant Jaume Square in front of the Catalan regional headquarters in Barcelona, their earlier joyful mood somewhat dampened by Rajoy s actions. In a stunning show of defiance of Madrid, the Catalan parliament had voted in the afternoon to make a unilateral declaration of independence. Despite the emotions and celebrations inside and outside the building, it was a futile gesture as shortly afterwards the Spanish Senate in Madrid approved the imposition of direct rule. Several European countries, including France and Germany,   and the United States also rejected the independence declaration and said they supported Rajoy s efforts to preserve Spain s unity. The crisis has now reached a new and possibly dangerous level as independence supporters have called for a campaign of disobedience. Immediately after news of the vote, Spanish shares and bonds were sold off, reflecting business concern over the turmoil. Catalonia held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 which was declared illegal by Madrid and marred by heavy-handed national police tactics to stop it. Although the referendum endorsed independence, it drew only a 43 percent turnout as Catalans who oppose independence largely boycotted it. The independence push has caused deep resentment around Spain. The chaos has also prompted a flight of business from Catalonia and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent. Catalonia is one of Spain s most prosperous regions and already has a high degree of autonomy. But it has a litany of historic grievances, exacerbated during the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship, when its culture and politics were suppressed. In Barcelona, Jordi Mercade, a 32-year-old engineer celebrating with friends, said he had mixed feelings about the day s events.  It s a day for history but many of us here also know we are not independent. They have the force. We are proud to having declared independence but we know this is not something definitive.  It is not certain whether the new election can resolve the crisis, as it could increase the numbers of independence supporters in parliament. Also unclear is how Rajoy s other measures will work on the ground, because of the reactions of civil servants and the regional police, know as the Mossos d Esquadra, who are reported to be divided in their loyalties. The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, called on civil servants not to follow orders from the Spanish government and urged them to follow  peaceful resistance .  Tensions are likely to rise significantly over the coming days,  Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said in a note.  Demonstrators might try to prevent the police from removing Catalan ministers from their offices if the central government decides to do so. This increases the risk of violent clashes with the police.  SHORT-LIVED LIBERTY A big crowd of independence supporters gathered outside   the regional parliament in Barcelona, shouting  Liberty  in Catalan and singing traditional songs as the independence vote went through. Among them was Monica Sanz, 44, a university lecturer who wore a Catalan flag around her neck.  We tried all peaceful means. Moderate people have reached this point because it was impossible to make an agreement with Spain,  she said. The motion, passed after a passionate debate from advocates and opponents of independence, said Catalonia constituted an independent, sovereign and social democratic state. Lawmakers from members of three national parties - the People s Party, the Socialists and Ciudadanos - walked out before the vote. Members of the pro-independence parties and the far-left Podemos then voted 70-10 in favour, in a secret ballot aimed at hindering any attempt by Madrid to lay criminal charges on them. The soon-to-be-sacked Puigdemont left the chamber to shouts of  President!  and mayors who had come from outlying areas brandished their ceremonial batons and sang the Catalan anthem  Els Segadors  (The Reapers).   Catalonia is and will be a land of freedom. In times of difficulty and in times of celebration. Now more than ever , Puigdemont said on Twitter. But within an hour, the upper house of Spain s parliament in Madrid authorized Rajoy s government to rule Catalonia directly.  Spain s constitutional court started a review of the vote for prosecutors to decide if its constituted rebellion. In Brussels, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the independence vote changed nothing and the EU would only deal with the central government.  Spain s IBEX fell as much 2.1 percent to a four-day low during the day, 10-year government bond yields hit a day high, and the euro dipped against the dollar on Friday after the Catalan independence declaration. The region contributes about a fifth of Spain s economy, the fourth-largest in the eurozone. JP Morgan said that due to the uncertainty, it was lowering its forecast for Spain s GDP for the last quarter of 2017 and first of 2018 to below the 3.5 per cent seen so far this year.

Myanmar corrects state media report on U.N. 'agreement' to help house refugees,"NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - A Myanmar state-run newspaper on Saturday corrected a report that a U.N. settlement program, UN-Habitat, had agreed to help build housing for people fleeing violence in the west of the country, where an army operation has displaced hundreds of thousands. The development underscores tension between Myanmar and the United Nations, which in April criticized the government s previous plan to resettle Rohingya Muslims displaced by last year s violence in  camp-like  villages.   More than 600,000 have crossed to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants sparked an army crackdown. The U.N. says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since then amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar (GNLM) newspaper said it had  incorrectly stated that UN-Habitat had agreed with the Union government to provide technical assistance in building housings for displaced people in northern Rakhine.   Union officials say that the issue is still under negotiation. The GNLM regrets the error,  said the newspaper. In its report on Thursday, the daily said UN-Habitat had agreed to provide technical assistance in housing the displaced and the agency would work closely with the authorities to  implement the projects to be favorable to Myanmar s social culture and administrative system . But the U.N. told Reuters in an email that no agreements had been reached  so far  after the agency s representatives attended a series of meetings with Myanmar officials this week in its capital Naypyitaw. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return, but it remains unclear whether those refugees would be allowed to return to their homes.  Rohingya who return to Myanmar are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to Myanmar officials and plans seen by Reuters.   Buddhist-majority Myanmar in August suggested that U.N. agencies such as the World Food Programme have provided food to Rohingya insurgents, adding to pressure on aid groups which had to suspend activities in Rakhine and pull out most of their staff.  Thousands of refugees have continued to arrive cross the Naf river separating Rakhine and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

Indonesia detains owner after deadly fireworks factory blaze,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities have detained a fireworks factory owner and a manager on suspicion of negligence after explosions and fire ripped through a warehouse on the outskirts of Jakarta, killing 48 workers and injuring dozens, police said on Saturday.     The blaze in the manufacturing hub of Tangerang was one of the worst industrial disasters to hit Southeast Asia s biggest economy, where safety standards are often weakly enforced.    Police said the fire started when sparks from a welding operation lit a stack of raw materials used for making fireworks, causing at least two explosions that could be heard miles away.       The men are suspected of negligence that led to deaths,  said Jakarta police spokesman Argo Yuwono. The owner of the PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses factory and an operations manager were detained while police looked for the welder. The owner was also suspected of employing underage workers, police said. Neither of the two detained was available for comment.     Tangerang regent Ahmed Zaki said on Friday that the company, which had been operating for two months, had a permit for packaging but not producing fireworks.     Preliminary investigations and witness accounts showed that more than 30 victims were found at the back of the factory, where they had run to try to escape while others had to break holes in the walls to get out. Police denied reports that the front gate and only exit of the factory was locked at the time of the fire.      All bodies, many of them charred beyond recognition, had been taken away from the gutted factory, and family members were providing DNA samples to try to identify them. Dozens of workers have been admitted to hospital with burns of up to 80 percent of their bodies. Hospital officials said some remained in critical condition and expected the death toll to rise.

Cambodia deports 61 telecom extortion scam suspects,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia police on Saturday deported 61 Chinese nationals wanted in China on suspicion of extorting money over the internet and by phone, they said, but Taiwan said 19 were from Taiwan. Several hundred suspected scammers have been arrested in Cambodia, which has emerged as a major center of rackets that have cost the victims billions of dollars. Pictures sent to Reuters on Saturday showed suspects wearing red shirts with their wrists bound together ahead of the deportation. Uk Heisela, chief of investigation at Cambodia s immigration department, said Chinese police had arrived to pick up the suspects.  The Immigration Department deported 61 suspects, including 13 women, who were involved in extortions on the internet,  Uk Heisela told Reuters. Uk Heisela said they had been detained during raids on Oct 17 and Oct 21 in the capital, Phnom Penh, and in Kandal and Preah Sihanouk provinces. Taiwan s government said 19 of them were from Taiwan, and that it had lodged a strong protest with China about the deportations. Taiwan has been unhappy that Taiwanese extortion suspects have been deported to China in the past and has accused Phnom Penh of acting at the behest of Beijing. China considers self-ruled Taiwan sovereign territory and Cambodia is one of China s closest allies in Southeast Asia. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Australian PM puts foreign minister in charge amid government crisis,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday appointed his foreign minister as acting prime minister as he tried to stem the fallout of a citizenship crisis that has cost his government its parliamentary majority.  Turnbull delayed until Monday a long-planned trip to Israel and held an emergency Cabinet meeting to shore up support after Australia s High Court ruled on Friday that his deputy, Barnaby Joyce, and four other lawmakers should be expelled from parliament because they held dual nationality.  The court s shock decision had immediate ramifications, stripping the coalition government of the one-seat majority it holds in the lower house, forcing it to call a by-election in Joyce s seat and sending the Australian dollar lower. The opposition Labor Party has said it is considering a legal challenge to every decision made by Joyce since last year s election. Turnbull said on Saturday that the deputy position would remain vacant until after the Dec. 2 by-election for Joyce s seat. The position normally goes to a member of the National Party, the junior partner in the coalition government.  Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, a member of Turnbull s Liberal Party, would instead be acting prime minister when he travels to Israel on Monday, three days behind schedule.   Government goes on, good government goes on,  Turnbull told reporters in Sydney, dismissing suggestions that the inability to agree on a deputy indicated tensions within the coalition.  When times get tough, that s when you put your arms around your mates.  Turnbull now needs the support of one of three independent lawmakers to keep his minority government afloat, with two sitting weeks of parliament left until it recesses for the year. At least two independent lawmakers have promised initial support, but noted that it may be conditional. Turnbull is under particular pressure after refusing demands from the opposition to remove Joyce, who has renounced his New Zealand citizenship, from the cabinet while the court decided his fate.  Turnbull said the court s interpretation of the constitution, which bars dual citizens from parliament in a bid to prevent split allegiances, was  very strict  and  very hard . He added that he was considering whether to recommend a change to the constitution, noting that more than half of the country s population of 24 million was either born overseas or has a parent who was born overseas.   Our objective is to ensure parliament is open to everybody,  he said. A referendum would be needed to change the constitution. The High Court ruled on seven lawmakers, some of whom had already resigned. All seven accepted that they were dual nationals at the time of their election but claimed they were unaware of their status. Some were conferred a second nationality by birth, others by descent.  The others dismissed were all senators in the upper house and their seats can be assigned to party-appointed alternatives. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Top Mexico university blames deadly bridge collapse on weak supports,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico s elite Tecnologico de Monterrey university said on Friday that structural shortcomings contributed to the collapse of walkways on its Mexico City campus in an earthquake last month, killing five college students. Rashid Abella Yunes, the school s vice-president for the Mexico City region, told Reuters that examinations showed two sets of pedestrian bridges stretching between three buildings were too weak to withstand the Sept. 19 quake that toppled dozens of buildings and killed nearly 230 people in the capital.  The supports that were supporting the bridges were just 15 centimeters, which to the judgment of experts could have been larger,  he said.  The buildings made the bridges lose support, and they fell.   Abella added that the university was leaving to Mexico City prosecutors the task of determining if any of the architects, contractors or inspectors that it hired between 1991 and 1998 to build the bridges could be held responsible.  None of the professionals that Abella said worked on the bridges were immediately reachable for comment. Construction and safety documents published last month by the Tlalpan district, where the campus is located, included an August 2017 structural safety certificate. Abella also said that Mexico City s construction regulations do not specify the size that bridge supports need to be in order be structurally sound.   The university, renowned for its engineering program, attributed its findings to Mexico City-based engineering firm Garcia Jarque Ingenieros, which it hired to investigate the collapse.   A group of nearly 100 alumni have been pressing the school to explain how the bridges were constructed.  Of all of the doubts that we ve had, none are resolved,  said Carlos Brito, a 2010 graduate. Family members of two students who died at the site said their children were crushed by falling bridges as they raced out of the ground-floor cafeteria beneath.  Juan Carlos Alvarez Blanco said his son, 19-year-old engineering student Juan Carlos, decided to stay on campus for lunch and died attempting to exit the cafeteria.  We want facts,  he said last week.  Along with the other four families, we are very, very devastated.   A relative of another student who died, who asked to not be named, said the young man, who studied engineering, had also been in the cafeteria.   Both family members declined to provide further comment on Friday. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Spain arrests four former Venezuelan officials for U.S. probe,"MADRID/CARACAS (Reuters) - Spanish authorities arrested a former Venezuelan deputy minister and three former executives at Venezuelan state companies for alleged links to money laundering and international corruption, Spain s Civil Guard said on Friday.     The operation was carried out with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The statement does not specify the names of those arrested but does include their initials and the position of one of them. It says that person is a former energy vice minister.      Venezuela and its state oil company PDVSA have been involved in several corruption scandals in recent years.     Neither PDVSA nor the Venezuelan government responded immediately to requests for comment.     About 10 people have pleaded guilty as part of a U.S.investigation into a $1 billion bribery plot involving payments to PDVSA officials, which became public with the arrest of two Venezuelan businessmen in 2015.

"China's neo-Maoists welcome Xi's new era, but say he is not the new Mao","BEIJING (Reuters) - A fringe group of hard-line conservatives who long for the way things were under communist China s founding leader, Mao Zedong, have welcomed President Xi Jinping s  new era  of socialism and its renewed emphasis on equality.  Their enthusiasm only goes so far, though. They don t want to put Xi on the same pedestal as Mao. At the ruling Communist Party s leadership conclave that wrapped up this week, Xi laid out a confident vision for a proud and prosperous China, with the party firmly in control, and cemented his authority as the country s most powerful leader since Mao took power in 1949 and declared the founding of modern China. Delegates praised Xi using Mao-era honorifics, and he became the first serving Chinese leader since Mao to have a named ideology written into the party charter, signaling that it will be in effect beyond his second five-year term, which began this week.  Their similarity is that they both want to rejuvenate the Chinese nation, they both want an independent, powerful, new China,  Song Yangbiao, a Beijing-based neo-Maoist freelance journalist, told Reuters.  Chairman Mao freed the Chinese people from the oppression of the West, while Xi Jinping has dedicated himself to giving new China a greater voice on the global stage,  he said. But Song said that it was  not realistic  to revive Mao s party chairman title and confer it on Xi. That elevation is a possibility that has been floated, according to some sources with ties to the leadership.  Chairman Mao s authority was built from a long and arduous struggle. Xi s power came from the bureaucracy in a time of peace. The history is totally different,  he said. Some mainstream party cadres at the congress did not have such reservations. Many called Xi a wise and great  lingxiu , or leader, an honorific only used for Mao Zedong and his short-lived successor Hua Guofeng. Bayanqolu, party chief of northeastern China s Jilin province, went so far as to call Xi  party helmsman , a term not in general use in senior Communist Party circles since Mao, who was called the  Great Helmsman .   Accepting Xi as a powerful leader, accepting him as the most powerful leader since Mao, is a necessary trait of Xi s new era,  said Sima Nan, a television pundit, blogger and defender of Mao and the Communist Party.  Look at how much he has said, how much he has written, how many people he has met - when does he have time to sleep?  he said in reference to Xi.   China has an awkward relationship with Mao s legacy.   Mao is still officially venerated by the Party as the founder, with a huge portrait overlooking Tiananmen Square and his face on every yuan banknote. But he is disliked by many intellectuals and others in China, who consider him personally responsible for the tumultuous decade-long Cultural Revolution and economic policies that caused famine and killed millions.   State media sometimes say that what Mao did was 30 percent negative and 70 percent positive. Neo-Maoists dismiss criticisms of Mao as smears by Westerners and revisionists, and the group vociferously defends Mao and his policies in articles online, with occasional public shaming of those who slight his legacy.   In January, a professor in central China was sacked from a university after Maoists protested a social media post in which he said Mao was responsible for millions of deaths.   While Xi has not lavished praise on Mao or his policies, he has defended his  mistakes  and has drawn a line against attempts to revise the Party s official history, pleasing the neo-Maoists.    He has also borrowed from Maoist imagery, rhetoric and  campaigns to enforce discipline on cadres, garner public support and strengthen the party s leading role in society.    Party, government, military, civilian and academic, east, west, south, north and center, the Party leads everything,  Xi said during his speech to open Congress. ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1
Factbox: Catalonia crisis - What's next?,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain on Friday sacked Catalonia s regional government, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for Dec. 21, in a bid to draw a line under the country s worst political crisis in 40 years. Below are several scenarios of what could happen in the next few days. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia s government including regional president Carles Puigdemont and his deputy Oriol Junqueras and assumed direct control over the region. Central government ministries will assume directly the powers of the Catalan administration until a regional election takes place on Dec. 21. It is not clear whether a snap regional election will resolve the crisis. An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government. Other opinion polls have shown Catalonia is almost evenly split between pro- and anti-independence supporters. Catalonia s main secessionist groups have called for widespread civil disobedience. They also instructed civil servants not to obey orders from Madrid and respond with peaceful resistance. It is unclear whether such calls will be followed or not. Spain s government said it was not planning to make any arrests, but it is unclear how it will proceed if the current regional administration staff refuse to leave their offices. A growing number of analysts fear this could lead to a physical confrontation if national police, who used heavy-handed tactics to thwart an Oct. 1 vote on independence, seek to intervene. One of the main problems over the implementation of direct rule will relate to Catalonia s own police forces, the Mossos d Esquadra. Rajoy said the Mossos chief would be fired. But a group of Mossos favoring independence has already said they would not follow instructions from the central government and would not use force to remove ministers and lawmakers from power. Several officers told Reuters they believed the 17,000-strong force was split between those who want independence and those who oppose it. The Mossos, whose chief is under investigation on suspicion of sedition, will have to act on direct orders from their new bosses. If deemed necessary, Mossos officers may be replaced by national police. The Economy Ministry has already increased its control over regional finances, to block the use of state funds to organize the secession bid, and started paying directly for essential services. Under the new proposal, Madrid will take full financial control. Many companies have however said on condition of anonymity that they feared a new Catalan treasury could start levying taxes, and that they would seek to move their tax base outside Catalonia. It is also possible that some pro-independence Catalans will stop paying their taxes to the Spanish treasury.

The media is likely to play an important role in the run-up to the new election in Catalonia. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Mexico will not recognize Catalonia's independence: President,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will not recognize Catalonia s declaration of independence from Spain, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto wrote in a post on Twitter on Friday evening. The political turmoil in Spain intensified on Friday as the Madrid government dismissed Catalonia s president and parliament hours after the region declared independence. Pena Nieto made it clear he will stand beside Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as he confronts the nation s most acute political crisis since it embraced democracy in 1978.  Mexico will not recognize the unilateral declaration of independence of Catalonia,  Pena Nieto wrote.  We hope for a political and peaceful solution.   Nations including France, Germany and the United States have also voiced their support for Spanish unity.   Spain was plunged into uncertainty on Oct. 1 when Catalonia, a prosperous northeastern state that accounts for 20 percent of Spain s gross domestic product, held an independence referendum, though courts had declared the proceedings illegal. Separatists declared victory despite a participation of only 43 percent. Shortly after the referendum, Mexico s Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said in a statement that the country favored a unified Spain.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
"Brazil's Temer to shuffle cabinet in March, main ally out: source","BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer will shuffle his cabinet in March and likely exclude members of his main allied party after many of its lawmakers turned against him this week, a senior government source said on Friday. The source, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the matter, said he did not expect the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) to be part of the future government.  The reshuffle follows the biggest revolt yet against Temer s 13-month government when the majority of PSDB lower-house deputies on Wednesday voted to put him on trial over corruption charges. The PSDB plans to field its own presidential candidate next year and may well quit Temer s coalition of its own accord as the elections draw closer, the source said. Though the lower house voted to shelve a corruption case against Temer, the upheaval in his ruling coalition is likely to derail Temer s plans to plug a budget deficit to help Brazil recover from its worst ever recession.  The planned cabinet changes will take place as ministers have to leave the cabinet by April to run in October elections.  Smaller allied parties have asked Temer to eject the PSDB from his government. It currently holds four cabinet posts. The source said Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes, a member of the PSDB, might stay on even if his party leaves the government. Temer, whose popularity is at rock bottom, has no plans to run for re-election. His centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Brazil s largest, has generally entered governments through coalitions with other parties and rarely fielded its own presidential candidate. Government officials expect the economy to pick up and grow at 3 percent by mid-2018, which would improve the PDMB s chances should it choose to do so. Such a candidate would likely be someone from outside the party and have to be untarnished by the corruption scandals battering Brazil s political class, the source said.

Islamic State guerrilla attacks point to its future strategy,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian and Iraqi forces closing in on the last scraps of Islamic State s caliphate straddling the remote border area between the two countries have already witnessed the jihadists  likely response. While their comrades mounted last stands in their Syrian capital of Raqqa and the city of Hawija in Iraq, IS militants seized the Syrian town of al-Qaryatayn and launched its biggest attack for months in Ramadi late last month. That is the kind of guerrilla insurgency both countries foresee IS turning to.   It is expected that after the Daesh terrorist organization s capacity to fight in the field is finished, its remnants will resort to this type of (guerrilla) operation. But for a certain period of time, not forever,  said a Syrian military source, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.     The continued ability for IS to mount attacks in areas where it was thought to have been eliminated will hinder efforts to stabilize regions when the fighting wanes.  In Iraq, where Islamic State originated, it has a proven record of falling back upon local networks from which it can rise anew when conditions allow. So far, it has not shown it has the same capacity in Syria, and it might find doing so more challenging there than in Iraq.  The sectarian divisions on which it thrives are less pronounced in Syria, and it faces competition there for jihadist loyalty from other powerful militant groups.  Daesh is in essence an Iraqi organization, it will survive to some extent in Iraq. Syrian members will dissolve in other Syrian Salafi jihadist groups,  said Hisham Hashami, an adviser on Islamic State to the Iraqi government. But in both countries it has shown it can exploit holes left by overstretched enemies to carry out spectacular attacks - the one in Syria s al-Qaryatayn most clearly - that spread panic and tie down opposing forces.  It has also proved able to carry out bombings and assassinations in areas controlled by the Iraqi and Syrian governments, U.S.-backed Kurdish militias and rival jihadist rebel groups, signaling an ability to survive underground.  A jihadist from a Syrian rebel faction opposed to Islamic State said the group had won enough support among young men to give it a latent capacity to revive.   I believe that it is possible, given that its ideology has spread widely among the youths, that something new will emerge,  the jihadist said, pointing to the highly effective propaganda machine deployed by Islamic State over the last three years. The al-Qaryatayn attack began on the evening of 29 September, when up to 250 militants with guns, rockets and mortars spread around the area with  terrible speed , said Ayman al-Fayadh, a resident.  It was particularly alarming because the government had declared al-Qaryatayn safe months ago, and had helped its residents to move back into their homes.  When the jihadists were finally forced out after three weeks of fighting around the outskirts of al-Qaryatayn, they took their revenge, slaughtering scores of its inhabitants.  They were very bloodthirsty and didn t spare anyone,  Fayadh said.  The Syrian military source said it took three weeks to retake the town because it was inhabited and the army was trying to avoid civilian casualties.  However, the attack showed how towns in Syria s deserts, where armed forces can be spread only thinly, are vulnerable to Islamic State and that such operations can tie down opposing armies.  People are afraid of Daesh returning,  said a Syrian journalist who visited the town this week.  They killed anyone who had taken part in pro-government protests. Bodies had been thrown in streets and in wells.  Fayadh also said townspeople were among the attackers, indicating that Islamic State used its years of rule to build local support networks and establish sleeper cells for future attacks - something that could be replicated elsewhere in Syria.   They re going to continue to have to look for places where they can plan and finance and resource and launch their attacks from,  said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, noting Islamic State had often used  sparsely populated areas .          The assault on Ramadi took place three days before. Militants attacked Iraqi security forces with suicide car bombs, mortars and machine guns in a city that it had apparently lost months earlier. The big challenge in both Iraq and Syria is to co-opt the Sunni Arab tribes, or risk a revival of jihadist insurgency. The Suuni-Shi ite divide has plagued Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that ignited the civil war. Shi ite parties backed by Iran have dominated the government and used militia forces against mostly Sunni insurgents. The Syrian government may have the same problem. It is allied to the region s main Shi ite powers - Iran and militia groups such as Lebanon s Hezbollah - and led by a president, Bashar al-Assad, from a Shi ite offshoot sect.  It will also be a challenge for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance in northern Syria, which is spearheaded by Kurdish groups. They have sometimes struggled to convince Arabs that it will protect their interests.   It all depends on the degree to which those fighting under Assad and the SDF incorporate settled tribes into governing structures,  said Andrew Tabler, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East policy.      Even in northwestern Syria, where rebel groups including jihadist factions hold sway, hardship and insurgent infighting might create space for Islamic State to again seize ground.  Beside the al-Qaryatayn attack, a group of Islamic State fighters have managed to take a pocket of territory in rebel-held areas near Hama in recent weeks, battling a rival jihadist group for control of several villages.  It has used bomb attacks and assassinations to target government-held cities in the west, Kurdish security forces in the northeast and Islamist rebel factions in the northwest.  In the isolated enclave it holds in Yarmouk camp south of Damascus, it has also shown renewed aggression, taking over the headquarters of a neighboring rebel group this month by force.  The jihadist rebel said he believed Islamic State could repeat the strategy it used in Iraq last decade of retrenching when under attack, then rebounding in more virulent form.   In this period of weakness, Islamic State depends on the ideology that it spread,  the jihadist said.  It appears that the same experience is being repeated. They could carry out bombings, a guerrilla war.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Catalonia or Neverland? Humor relieves tension in Spain,"MADRID (Reuters) - Shortly after the Catalan government defied Madrid and held a referendum on independence, Jaume Vives held his own  vote  on whether to separate his central Barcelona balcony from  this Catalonia of madmen . Using a megaphone, the 25-year-old journalist declared the nine votes cast by his assembled friends and family were really 2.4 million - a slightly inaccurate reference to the 2.3 million who voted for a break with Spain. Then he suspended the decision   just as Catalan president Carles Puigdemont had done with his Oct. 10 decision to pursue independence in the Catalan parliament. A video of the stunt has been watched 890,000 times on YouTube as people on both sides of the independence divide turn to satire to break the tension of a real-life drama that is both dividing and maddening the nation. The drama s two main actors - Puigdemont and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy - are the butt of most jibes.   The anti-independence camp has aimed its jokes at Puigdemont and what they see as his reluctance to be decisive and his flip-flop statements on the independence question.  In recent weeks, he has declared independence then suspended his declaration, accepted an invitation to address the Senate then declined it, and called for an independence vote in Catalan parliament   and then deferred it. One bar in Barcelona recently put up a sign that declared free beer for all - but then, tongue-in-cheek, said the measure was immediately suspended pending talks with the beer company. One mock TV game show presented a puzzled Puigdemont considering his answer to the final question of an episode of  Who wants to be a millionaire?   What is Catalonia right now?,  the question read on the screen, with the four possible answers listed as: A - a region ? B - Neverland ? C - a Republic ?, or D - a circus ? On the other side, satirists have homed in on Prime Minister Rajoy and his insistence that Puigdemont renounce independence as a condition of negotiations. In one online parody, Rajoy is shown with U.S. President Donald Trump s hair and a caption saying:  I will build a wall, - and Catalonia will pay for it.  At a recent pro-independence demonstration in Barcelona he appeared on a poster kissing Spanish dictator Francisco Franco - historically a hate figure in Catalonia - on the lips amid a burst of pink heart shapes. Another, shared hundreds of thousands of times on Whatsapp, shows Rajoy embracing Puigdemont and saying,  He stays , in a parody of a famous tweet from FC Barcelona defender Gerard Pique announcing that Brazilian star Neymar would not leave the club. Neymar signed for Paris Saint Germain days later. The satire highlights the fatigue that both sides feel. Barcelona has buzzed for the past two months with repeated, large-scale protests, mostly for independence but also including one rally of more than 300,000 against secession. Humor has become a means of escape from the seemingly endless tension. From his balcony in the upmarket residential neighborhood of Sarria-Sant Gervasi, Vives described his lone anti-independence as a  Smiling Counter-Revolution .   We are reducing to absurdity the absurd reality we are living, and the lies they tell us,  Vives said.  Doing this reduces the tension in the atmosphere. Jokes don t feed hatred.

Fired Mexico prosecutor drops bid to fight dismissal,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico s top prosecutor for electoral crimes on Friday said he would no longer fight his dismissal by the acting attorney general, ending a simmering dispute that had caused embarrassment to the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto.  Mexico s acting attorney general last week fired Santiago Nieto on the grounds that he broke a code of conduct for officials. Nieto s firing came just days after he spoke publicly about a graft investigation linked to the campaign of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. His summary dismissal stirred up a major row in Congress that at one point threatened to impede the passage of  legislation, but with the passing of a key budget bill late on Thursday, there were signs the dispute was receding. In a letter to the Senate and a news conference, Nieto said that he had become too polarizing a figure to keep working ahead of national elections next year. However, he insisted he had broken no law and that he had been unfairly dismissed.  For all these reasons I have decided to withdraw my objection to (my dismissal),  he said in the letter. Nieto was fired after an interview with newspaper Reforma in which he said Emilio Lozoya, the former boss of state oil firm Pemex, wrote to him to ask that he be declared innocent of accusations he funneled cash from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht into Pena Nieto s 2012 election campaign.  Lozoya, who was a senior adviser to Pena Nieto in the campaign, denies the allegations about Odebrecht. The firm is at the heart of a bribery and kickback probe, known as Lava Jato or Car Wash, that has reverberated across Latin America. Pena Nieto has also denied involvement in any wrongdoing related to the 2012 campaign. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1

Italian man sentenced to 24 years for infecting dozens of women with HIV,"ROME (Reuters) - An Italian man was sentenced on Friday to 24 years in prison for infecting more than 30 women with the HIV virus, after having unprotected sex with them despite knowing that he was HIV positive, a court ruled. Valentino Talluto, a 33-year-old accountant, seduced dozens of women via social networks for a decade before his arrest in November 2015. Police believe he had sex with at least 53 women during that time, passing on the virus to 32 of them. The male partners of three of the women subsequently contracted the potentially fatal illness, as did an eight-month-old infant of a fourth woman. Talluto often found an excuse not to wear a condom, telling his partners that he was allergic to them, or had just had an HIV test, the court in Rome heard.  He expressed regret for what had happened, but said he did not realize the consequences of his actions.  Prosecutors had urged the court to give him life in jail, saying he had provoked an HIV epidemic. The court rejected this, convicting him instead of  grievous and incurable bodily harm . Many of the women only discovered they had HIV after they heard of Talluto s arrest and had a test. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s.

German groups mobilize against rise of far right,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German civil rights groups are mobilizing against the newly elected far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and other more hardline groups, vowing to avert the even stronger rightward lurch seen in neighboring countries. Thousands of protesters are expected in the eastern city of Dresden on Saturday when the anti-Islam PEGIDA movement  celebrates its third anniversary. PEGIDA - Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West - has seen dwindling crowds since early 2015, with the AfD absorbing some of its supporters. The AfD won almost 13 percent of the vote in the Sept. 24 national election, making it the third largest party in the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the first far-right party to win seats in more than half a century. Exit polls showed that 60 percent of AfD voters cast a  protest vote , with many angry at Chancellor Angela Merkel s 2015 decision to allow in over a million mainly Muslim migrants.  Experts say the party s rise is also part of a global trend that has brought right-leaning parties or leaders to power in Poland, Hungary, and most recently, Austria.  Germany s mainstream parties have said they will not work with the AfD at a national level, but activists say they must stake out clear resistance to AfD comments on Islam and other issues in the parliament, and 14 out of 16 state legislatures.  We ve seen a strong and growing movement of people resisting the AfD in recent months in big cities, in small towns, and now we need that movement on a national scale,  said Nora Berneis of Aufstehen gegen Rassismus, or Standing up against Racism. The group is planning a large protest in the northern city of Hanover on Dec. 2 when the AfD meets for a party conference. The party has drawn sharp criticism from a German journalists  group for seeking data on the ethnic backgrounds and political views of journalists who want to cover the conference. Christoph Schott, with the global activist group Avaaz, said more than 500,000 people had signed an open letter to the AfD, rejecting the party s  xenophobic  and  racist  messages. The AfD rails against what it calls the  Islamisation of Europe  and denies it is racist.  Beginning with Allied  re-education  efforts after World War Two, Germany has developed an intense civic education program. The government doubled funding for projects aimed at combating right-wing, left-wing and Islamist extremism to over 100 million euros in 2017 alone. Some credit such policies with keeping support for far-right parties lower than in neighboring countries. But Axel Ruppert with the European Network against Racism said the AfD s aggressive rhetoric was pressing the boundaries of  acceptable  discourse and hate crimes were rising. Police data showed a 14-percent rise in right-wing extremist violent acts in 2016, and anti-Semitic crimes rose 4 percent to 681 in the first eight months of 2017. The AfD s entry into parliament has triggered a long-overdue dialogue about what went wrong during the unification of eastern and western Germany in 1990, said Michaela Glaser with the German Youth Institute, a non-profit research association.  One silver lining ... may be that things that were hidden before have become visible. And only if something has been articulated can it be addressed,  she said. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Libyans dig for water in latest test for capital's residents,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Across Libya s capital residents have started drilling through pavements to access wells in a desperate search for water after the taps ran dry in a new low for living conditions.  After years of neglect, workers turned off the water to do urgent maintenance earlier this month, cutting supplies to many Tripoli households. Then an armed group sabotaged the system, prolonging the misery.  The water crisis is a powerful symbol of state failure in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in the Middle East but has been gripped by turmoil since a 2011 uprising unseated Muammar Gaddafi. For Libyans the chaos has meant power cuts and crippling cash shortages. These are often made worse by battles between armed groups vying for control of the fractured oil-rich state and its poorly-maintained infrastructure.  We haven t had water for ten days. The state does nothing,  said Nasser Said, a landlord in Tripoli s upmarket Ben Ashour district. Already equipped with a generator to keep the power running during outages that sometimes last more than a day, he hired drillers to dig some 31 meters to extract groundwater for the six apartments in the residential block he owns.  No water, no electricity. You become a state in a state,  he said, standing next to his building on a leafy sidestreet.  We last had to do this maybe 20 years ago.  Like many Libyans, Said is skeptical about the chances of U.N.-led peace talks unifying rival factions that have been fighting for control. The talks were adjourned last week with little sign of progress in creating a government that could stabilize Libya and stand up to armed groups that have repeatedly seized oil facilities and other state assets to make demands. The U.N.-supported Government of National Accord (GNA) has struggled to impose its authority since its leaders arrived in Tripoli in March last year.  Early last week an armed faction in the south said it had turned off water supplies from Gaddafi s Great Man Made River, a pipeline system that pumps water from underneath Libya s vast southern desert to coastal areas such as Tripoli.  The group is seeking the release of a leader imprisoned by a rival faction in the capital, said Tawfiq Shwehaidi, a manager at the Great Man Made River based in the eastern city of Benghazi.  We had started maintenance work on the 16th (of October) and cut supplies to Tripoli,  he said.  Afterwards an armed group... set one power plant on fire which closed three other plants and shut down 24 wells.   That has deprived residents of water while boosting the business of drillers who for 4,000-6,000 Libyan dinars ($2,940-$4,410 at the official exchange rate) access groundwater unused in some neighborhoods since the Great Man Made River started pumping water to Tripoli in 1996.   We drill about three wells in two weeks   it takes about three to four days to drill a well,  said Abdulsalam Forganea, a 23-year-old worker helping to operate an ageing drilling rig. Parts of Tripoli offer a semblance of normality and power cuts have eased since the summer. The city has seen fewer big clashes since a handful of armed groups aligned with the GNA earlier this year. But security is still fragile. A former prime minister was abducted in August for nine days by one of the two most powerful armed groups, while the other engaged in a battle this month that shut down the airport. A Reuters reporter recently saw a traffic clogged commercial street suddenly empty as a man was fatally shot by militiamen. Kidnapping for ransom is rife. A conflict that escalated in 2014 has put extra pressure on a Tripoli population that swelled to an estimated three million with the arrival of displaced families from other Libyan cities. Public health services are failing, inflation has spiraled, and the start of the school year has been delayed by several weeks because teachers are striking over salaries.  Shutdowns crippled oil revenues so little has been spent on repairs and maintenance, and the water network and other infrastructure have been corroded. Most government spending goes on public salaries, including for former rebel groups that forced their way onto the state payroll after Gaddafi s overthrow.  No budget has been transferred... since 2011 except the emergency budget, which is the result of the financial difficulties experienced by the Libyan state,  said Naji Assaed, head of the Libyan Water Authority. Production at desalination plants has fallen sharply, with output at a plant in the western town of Zuwara dropping from 80,000 cubic liters to 16,000 cl annually. Assaed said officials were working hard to resolve the crisis, but it was not clear when supplies would be restored. As he spoke a tanker arrived up to deliver water for his tattered ministry building.  In the absence of adequate spare parts, lack of budgets, lack of stability in the security situation, security chaos, people do not comply with the law and all this has affected the performance of the system,  he said.

U.S. says Congo must hold long-delayed election by end of 2018,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo must hold a long-delayed election to replace President Joseph Kabila by the end of next year or the vote will lose international support, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said on Friday. Repeated delays to the poll, originally scheduled for late 2016, have led to unrest and raised fears the Central African nation could slip back into the kind of conflicts that killed millions around the turn of the century. U.S. envoy Nikki Haley met with Kabila for 90 minutes on Friday. She is the most senior member of President Donald Trump s administration to visit the country.   It was a firm, candid conversation,  Haley told a small group of reporters, adding she had  made very clear that the United States wanted to see elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018 and we wouldn t accept elections any later .   A relationship with the United States is dependent on how he acts going forward,  she said.  He has the ability to either support that or not support that, but we have the ability to make our decisions based on that.  Haley, who earlier on Friday met with the Congolese electoral commission (CENI), political opposition and Catholic bishops, did not elaborate on what action the United States could take.       After meeting with CENI, she told reporters she had passed on a message that  these elections must take place in 2018 or there will be no support for the electoral process .  Every day we don t have elections in this country someone dies,  she said.  The electoral commission had said earlier this month that the vote to replace Kabila could not take place until April 2019 at the earliest, leading the opposition to warn that the population would  take matters into its own hands . Dozens died in protests against Kabila s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December. The resulting political crisis has also contributed to rising militia violence in Congo s east and center. Kabila, who has ruled Congo since his father s assassination in 2001, says the election delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters.  However, his opponents accuse him of using the delay to maneuver to remove term limits that prevent him from standing for re-election, as presidents in neighboring Rwanda and Congo Republic have done. He denies those charges.  Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende said the government hoped to see the election as soon as possible but that it was up to the electoral commission to set the date.  It s not up to the government, nor to Ms Haley to organize the elections,  Mende said.  I don t think that we can be subjected to these kinds of diktats.  International donors have said they are prepared to provide significant funding to elections but are waiting for a realistic calendar from CENI. So far, they have contributed only 6 percent of the $123 million that the United Nations is expecting, the head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo said earlier this month.

Barca's Valverde skirts independence debate as Iniesta ruled out for Bilbao,"MADRID, (Reuters) - Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde declined to be drawn on Friday on whether a declaration of independence by Catalonia s parliament meant his side might end up being kicked out of La Liga.     The Spanish football league s president Javier Tebas was previously quoted as saying that, should Catalonia become independent, the region s sides would not be able to compete in La Liga.  Valverde declined to comment on the possibility of that happening.      Nothing has happened (in relation to Barcelona not being in La Liga) and we re only talking about hypothetical situations,  he said.      I have my own opinion but I just want to concentrate on sporting questions, especially because the political situation appears to change every half hour.      In a bid to draw a line under Spain s worst political crisis in 40 years, the government in Madrid on Friday sacked Catalonia s regional government, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for Dec. 21. In what appears to be a doomed gesture, the parliament had hours earlier declared independence following a referendum on secession that Spanish courts had ruled was illegal. On the pitch, table-topping Barca confirmed that midfield playmaker Andres Iniesta would miss Saturday s visit to Athletic Bilbao.     The club captain, who this week was named in the FIFPro Team of the Year, has a thigh strain and adds to a growing list of absentees for Valverde that also includes Ousmane Dembele, Rafinha, Arda Turan, Aleix Vidal and Thomas Vermaelen.     The news is not all negative, however, with full back Jordi Alba given the green light by the club s medical staff to return to action.     Valverde joined Barca from Bilbao in the summer and will visit his former club as coach of the Catalans for the first time, insisting he will not allow emotion to get the better of him.      For me it s a special game. A lot of things link me to Athletic, but tomorrow I am the opponent,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Morneau Shepell​ sees no impact from pension legislation,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Morneau Shepell Inc (MSI.TO), the human resources management company at the heart of conflict-of-interest allegations against Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said on Friday it would not benefit from pension or tax legislation proposed by the Liberal government. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s government has been badly shaken by the conflict-of-interest controversy about his finance minister, who is the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of Morneau Shepell. Some have questioned whether Morneau, whose father founded Morneau Shepell, would be forced to resign. Morneau Shepell, a major provider of pension administration services to private companies and government agencies, said it is not involved in the consultation for either changes to the small business tax code or to the pension reform.  If passed, (the pension reform) would allow federally regulated pension plans the option to implement target benefit pension plans. They would not be required to do this,  the company said in a statement.  Several provinces have already enacted similar enabling legislation for pension plans that they regulate, but in practice, very few employers have adopted it,  Morneau Shepell said. The company said it severed all contact with Morneau upon his election to the House of Commons in October 2015. Morneau resigned as executive chairman of Morneau Shepell shortly after his election. Morneau, who was named finance minister shortly after his election to Parliament, said last week he would put his assets in a blind trust and divest his stockholding in the family business in response to criticism that his proposals for pension or tax reform could benefit his company and his personal finances. On Thursday, Morneau said he will donate to charity any profit that his Morneau Shepell shares have made since he was elected. The company s stock, currently trading at C$21.17, closed at C$15.77 in the session before the election, which would put the potential profit for the 1 million shares Morneau has said he holds at C$5.4 million. Morneau told reporters on Thursday he did not know what the difference in the value of the shares will be. Opposition parties from both the political left and right have seized on the ethics scandal, trying to tie Trudeau s team to what they say is an entitled Liberal Party that has previously faced corruption charges.

U.S. seeks meeting soon to revive Asia-Pacific 'Quad' security forum,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States wants a meeting soon aimed at reviving a four-way dialogue between itself, Japan, India and Australia to deepen security cooperation and coordinate alternatives for regional infrastructure financing to that offered by China, a senior U.S. official said on Friday. The so-called  Quad  to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances. In an interview with Japan s Nikkei newspaper on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Manila in August. According to the Nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from Asia to Africa. It said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6, when the U.S. leader visits Japan as part of an Asian tour that will also take him to China. Alice Wells, Washington s acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters after accompanying Tillerson on a visit to India that Washington was  looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.   The quadrilateral the Japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with India and Japan,  she said. Wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values  to reinforce those values in the global architecture.   As we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values - freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously Australia would be a natural partner in that effort.  Wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing China, which has alarmed Asia-Pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.  She said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development,  that don t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.   It s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain China,  she said.  It s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region.  Tillerson said before visiting India that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to Chinese financing that was saddling countries with  enormous  debts and failing to create jobs.

"Bomb attack kills one Bahraini policeman, wounds eight","DUBAI (Reuters) - Militants attacked a Bahraini police bus near the Jidhafs area outside the capital Manama, killing one policeman and wounding eight others, the interior ministry said on Friday. The attack targeted the bus on the Khalifa bin Salman highway, the ministry said, adding that the militant group used a handmade bomb.  Investigations are underway to determine the circumstances of this premeditated terrorist attack and arrest the group involved,  the ministry said in a statement on its website. The incident was the latest in a series of attacks targeting policemen in the country where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based. The government blames the attacks on Shi ite militants it says are backed by Iran to destabilize the country, a charge Tehran denies. This month, a blast wounded five policemen on Budaiya road, near Manama, while they were guarding a procession by Shi ite Muslims marking the annual Ashura festival, which commemorates the death of Prophet Mohammad s grandson Imam Hussein some 1400 years ago.

German CSU hopes for coalition by year's end despite tricky talks,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel s Bavarian allies still hope a three-way coalition government can be formed by the end of the year even though negotiators made little progress on bridging deep divisions this week, a senior party official said on Friday. Merkel is trying to unite her conservative alliance, which consists of her CDU and its Bavarian CSU sister party, in a pact with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats to form a government. The conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month. After meeting for 11 hours on Thursday, the three camps resigned themselves to further talks next week after making little headway on the contentious issues of immigration and climate policy.  Our aim is for the exploratory talks to be at the stage in mid-November where we can tell our (party) committees  yes, this works, let us begin concrete negotiations ,  said Manfred Weber, a senior member of the CSU who is involved in the talks.  And then I hope we will have a new government by the end of the year,  he told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk, but added:  It will be very difficult.  Immigration was the most divisive topic on Thursday. Many conservatives want to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on Merkel s decision to open Germany to more than a million mainly Middle Eastern migrants in 2015 and 2016. Negotiators will meet again next Monday and Thursday, by which time they want to seek a solution on refugee policy, sources close to the talks said. An agreement reached between Merkel s CDU and the CSU to cap annual refugee numbers had to be the basis of any coalition accord, Andreas Scheuer, CSU general secretary, said after Thursday s talks. The Greens oppose a refugee cap. Politicians say it could take months to form the coalition, leaving Germany hobbled as the European Union looks to its wealthiest country for leadership on governance reform.

Exclusive: Death certificate offers clues on Russian casualties in Syria,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - An official document seen by Reuters shows that at least 131 Russian citizens died in Syria in the first nine months of this year, a number that relatives, friends and local officials say included private military contractors.  The document, a death certificate issued by the Russian consulate in Damascus dated Oct. 4, 2017, does not say what the deceased was doing in Syria. But Reuters has established in interviews with the families and friends of some of the deceased and officials in their hometowns that the dead included Russian private military contractors killed while fighting alongside the forces of Moscow s ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The presence of the Russian contractors in Syria - and the casualties they are sustaining - is denied by Moscow, which wants to portray its military intervention in Syria as a successful peace mission with minimal losses. The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters. Requests for comment from the Russian consulate in Damascus did not elicit a response.     Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement provided to Reuters on Friday:  We do not have information about individual citizens who visit Syria. With that, I consider this question dealt with.  Reuters sent questions to a group of Russian private military contractors active in Syria through a person who knows their commanders, but did not receive a response. The official death toll of military personnel in Syria this year is 16. A casualty figure significantly higher than that could tarnish President Vladimir Putin s record five months before a presidential election which he is expected to contest. A Reuters count of the number of Russian private contractors known to have been killed in Syria this year, based on interviews with relatives and friends of the dead and local officials in their hometowns, stands at 26. Russian authorities have not publicly released any information this year about casualties among Russian civilians who may have been caught up in the fighting.  The Russian Foreign Ministry, in response to Reuters questions, said the consulate in Syria was fulfilling its duties to register the deaths of Russian citizens. It said that under the law, personal data obtained in the process of registering the deaths was restricted and could not be publicly disclosed. In August, Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defense ministry spokesman, said in response to a previous Reuters report that information about Russian military contractors in Syria was  a myth , and that Reuters was attempting to discredit Moscow s operation to restore peace in Syria. A Russian diplomat who has worked in a consulate in another part of the world, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the figure of 131 registered deaths in nine months was unusually high given the estimated number of Russian expatriates in Syria. Although there is no official data for the size of the community, data from Russian national elections shows there were only around 5,000 registered Russian voters in the country in 2012 and 2016.   It is as if the diaspora is dying out,  he said. High numbers of deaths are usually recorded by Russian consulates only in tourist destinations such as Thailand or Turkey, he said. Russian consulates do not register the deaths of military personnel, according to an official at the consulate in Damascus who did not give his name. The consular document seen by Reuters was a  certificate of death  issued to record the death of Sergei Poddubny, 36. It was one of three death certificates seen by Reuters. Poddubny s certificate, which bears the consulate s stamp, lists the cause of death as  carbonization of the body  - in other words, he was burned.  It said he was killed on Sept. 28 in the town of Tiyas, Homs province, the scene of heavy fighting between Islamist rebels and pro-Assad forces. Several Russian contractors were killed in the area earlier this year, friends and relatives told Reuters. Poddubny s body was repatriated and buried in his home village in southern Russia about three weeks later. He had been in Syria as a private military contractor, one of his relatives and one of his friends told Reuters.  Poddubny s death certificate had a serial number in the top right corner, 131. Under a Justice Ministry procedure, all death certificates are numbered, starting from zero at the start of the year and going up by one digit for each new death recorded. The Russian diplomat confirmed that is the procedure.  Reuters saw two other certificates, both issued on Feb. 3. The numbers - 9 and 13 - indicate certificates for at least five deaths were issued on that day. They were both private military contractors, according to people who know them. The death of a Russian citizen would have to be registered at the consulate in order to repatriate the body back to Russia via civilian channels, according to the Russian diplomat. A death certificate from the consulate would also help with bureaucracy back home relating to the dead person s assets, the  diplomat said. The bodies of Russians fighting on the rebel side are not repatriated, according to a former Russian official who dealt with at least six cases of Russians killed in Syria and the relatives of four Russian Islamists killed there. A few thousand Russian citizens with Islamist sympathies have traveled to rebel-held areas since the conflict began in 2011, according to Russian officials. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
German far-right party wants journalists' private data,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) wants access to data about the ethnic backgrounds and political views of journalists who want to cover the party s national congress in December after it became the third largest party in parliament.  Journalists who register to cover the conference in Hanover are being asked to check a box in which they agreed to the collection, storage and use of personal data provided, such as name, medium and press pass number, as well as  special data . The form references a section in Germany s data protection law, which lists such  special data  as including racial and ethnic background, political views, religious or philosophical convictions, union membership, health or sexual orientation. Other parties require basic information for registration of journalists but do not ask for such personal details. The party, which rails against what it calls the  Islamisation of Europe  and  fake news  coverage by mainstream news outlets, declined to comment to the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper, which first reported the issue on Friday. The Berlin data protection official is investigating the issue, the newspaper reported.   This is an unacceptable intrusion into the private affairs of journalists,  Hendrik Zoerner, spokesman for the German Journalists Association, was quoted as telling the paper.  We call on the AfD to immediately remove the required agreement.  No comment was immediately available to Reuters from the party, the Berlin data protection official or the journalists  group.  The AfD won early 13 percent of vote on Sept. 24, making it the third largest party in the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the first far-right group to move into the legislature in more than half a century.  German civil rights groups are mobilizing to stage a large protest in Hanover at the congress on Dec. 2. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Norway says sunken Russian helicopter wreckage may have been located,"OSLO/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Norwegian rescuers believe they may have located the sunken wreckage of a Russian helicopter that went missing on Thursday with eight people aboard off the coast of the Arctic Svalbard archipelago.  We ve found oil spills and air bubbles rising to the surface, and a vessel in the area has observed what appears to be a submerged object. It may be the helicopter,  Tore Hongset, the leader of Norway s rescue coordination center, told Reuters. A remotely operated mini submarine was being flown to the site and would likely be deployed in the early hours of Friday to help verify whether a discovery had been made, he added. A search for survivors would continue, the rescue center said, noting that the helicopter was equipped with life rafts. Russia s Emergency Ministry said the five crew and three passengers were Russians. The Russian-made Mil Mi-8 aircraft had been reported missing around 1335 GMT. The three passengers were working for Russia s Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, the Russian Energy Ministry said in a statement. The helicopter was on its way from the abandoned Pyramiden settlement to the coal mining port of Barentsburg, but was later confirmed to have gone down in the ocean a few kilometers from its destination. Several vessels were in the area, according to shipping data from Marinetraffic.com. The ship of the governor of Svalbard, the Polarsyssel, was coordinating the search. The Russian coal company Arktikugol runs the coal mine at Barentsburg, which employs Russian and Ukrainian miners. An official at the Russian company Convers Avia Air told Reuters it owned the helicopter and had lost communication with it. Earlier, Hongset told Norwegian broadcaster TV2:  For every minute that goes by, the risk of hypothermia and death rises.  Located around 700 kilometers (435 miles) north of the European mainland, Svalbard is governed under a treaty that grants NATO-member Norway sovereignty while allowing other signatories to do business and exploit natural resources.  More than 40 countries are parties to the treaty. Moscow has maintained a presence on the islands for decades as a strategic foothold in the high north. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Iraq orders truce with Kurds to allow peaceful deployment at border crossings,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered a 24-hour suspension to military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq, to allow for the peaceful deployment of Iraqi troops at the border crossings with the Kurdistan region. A Kurdish spokesman earlier said the two sides reached an agreement on Friday to stop fighting which broke out on Oct. 16, after Iraqi forces seized the oil-city of Kirkuk. Abadi ordered the offensive on Kirkuk and other Kurdish-held territory in retaliation to the Sept. 25 vote for independence in a referendum organized by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) - a drive that was all but crushed by the surprise attack. The 24-hour truce  should allow a joint technical committee ... to work on the deployment of federal Iraqi forces in all disputed areas, including Fish-Khabur, and the international border , Abadi said in a statement.   This should prevent bloodshed between the children of the same country.  He wants to take control of border crossings with neighboring countries, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil. The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and  starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution  - call rejected by Baghdad.     According to the KRG, which is based in the Kurdish autonomous region s capital of Erbil, the ceasefire entered effect at 1 a.m. on Friday (2200 GMT Thursday).  The ceasefire is holding,  Vahal Ali, the director of KRG  President Masoud Barzani s media office, told Reuters.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also urged dialogue to start, in a call to Abadi, the Iraqi central government said in a statement on Friday morning. U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country. The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16 but the Kurdish Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region. The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds as the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by Barzani, as it halved the region s oil export revenue.  The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur, and also south of their capital Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides. Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, Tillerson said he was  disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution  and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG  overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution . Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks.  We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,  he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran. The spokesman of the U.S.-led anti Islamic State coalition in Baghdad, U.S. Colonel Ryan Dillon, told Reuters:  Both parties are talking with one another, but it is not an official ceasefire.   In an interview with Kurdish TV Rudaw, Dillon called on the two sides to extend the deal to a complete halt in hostility and  refocus our efforts on defeating ISIS .  We are encouraging dialogue, we are trying to get the tensions down,  he added. Iraqi forces on Thursday launched an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria. Abadi has expressed hope the group will be completely defeated in Iraq before the end of the year. The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi ite militias backed by Iran and Russia. Islamic State s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, in a gruelling battle which lasted nine months. The militants  Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces earlier this month. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. He urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
"Turkish ex-coastguard commander, 24 others jailed for life in coup trial","ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Friday sentenced 25 people, including a former coastguard commander, to life in prison for trying to overthrow the government during a failed coup last year, state news agency Anadolu reported. Prosecutors had charged 28 people over incidents at a naval base in the northwestern province of Kocaeli on July 15, the night of the coup attempt. Three suspects were acquitted. The Ankara court named the coastguard commander as Hakan Ustem. The trial was one of the first in a series of cases against people accused of involvement in the failed putsch, in which more than 240 people were killed when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks, warplanes and helicopters and attacked state institutions including parliament. Earlier this month, a court found 42 former soldiers guilty of trying to kill President Tayyip Erdogan during the coup, handing most of them life sentences. The government blames the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Erdogan, for orchestrating the failed coup.  Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement and condemned the coup. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Syrian government to blame for April sarin attack: U.N. report,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad is to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people last April, according to a report sent to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday.  The Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017,  the report from the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) said. The attack prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike.   Time and again, we see independent confirmation of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime,  Nikki Haley, the United States  U.N. ambassador, said in a statement.  The Security Council must send a clear message that the use of chemical weapons by anyone will not be tolerated, and must fully support the work of the impartial investigators.  The report also said ISIS was to blame for the use of sulfur mustard in the Syrian town of Umm Hawsh on Sept. 15 and 16, 2016. The JIM was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November, and Russia on Tuesday vetoed a proposal to further extend its mandate. Russian ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia said earlier this week Russia would consider revisiting the mandate extension after Thursday s report is discussed. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China hopes that the conclusions of any investigation have a basis in conclusive proof and are professional, objective and fair.  The continuing use of chemical weapons, including by non-State actors, is deeply disturbing,  said the report.  If such use, in spite of the prohibition by the international community, is not stopped now, a lack of consequences will surely encourage others to follow.  The JIM has already found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015.          Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the country s more than six-year civil war. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Syria rejects report blaming it for April sarin attack: state media,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian government rejected a report sent to the U.N. Security Council that blamed it for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in April in which dozens of people were killed, state media said on Friday.  Syria rejects in form and substance what was included in the report of the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) that was announced yesterday,  state news agency SANA reported, citing an official in Syria s foreign ministry. The official said the report had been compiled under instructions from the United States and other Western countries  to place more political pressure  on Syria, SANA reported. The JIM report found Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s government responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhoun on April 4 this year. The attack prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike.  (Damascus) condemns the reliance of the Joint Investigative Mechanism on the word of criminals who committed this immoral act in Khan Sheikhoun and those of suspect witnesses, as well as so-called open sources,  a statement by the foreign ministry official said. The official also said Syria renewed its commitment to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and said it had no chemical materials restricted by the agreement. Syria considered the use of chemical weapons  an immoral act, condemned everywhere, at any time, under any circumstance,  SANA reported. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1

'Death to blasphemers' increasing as political rallying cry in Pakistan,"SWABI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Three police officers stand daily guard at the tomb of Pakistani student Mashal Khan to prevent religious hardliners from fulfilling threats to blow up the grave of the 23-year-old beaten to death over rumors he blasphemed against Islam. His grieving family, now also under police protection, say they have little hope the shocking campus killing will prompt a re-examination of blasphemy laws that carry a death penalty, or action against the mob justice that often erupts in such cases.  On Friday, there was more evidence the opposite is happening.  A new political party that has made punishing blasphemers its main rallying cry won a surprisingly strong 7.6 percent of the vote in a by-election in Peshawar, 60 km (36 miles) from where Mashal Khan was killed six months ago.  Death to blasphemers! Death to blasphemers!  was a common chant of supporters of the Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan party at its campaign rallies in the conservative northwestern city.  The party s relatively strong showing - and a separate outcry over a proposed change to an election law that outraged the religious right - has elevated blasphemy into a potent political issue in the run-up to a general election in 2018. While Tehrik-e-Labaik (Movement of the Prophet s Followers) is unlikely to break out of single digits in coming votes, its rapid rise, along with another ultra-religious party, could create an additional challenge for the ruling Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).  The PML-N party s leader, Nawaz Sharif, was ousted as prime minister in July by the Supreme Court, and opposition leader Imran Khan - who spearheaded the legal case that removed him over unreported income - is seeking to press the advantage. In this week s Peshawar by-election, former cricket star Imran s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party swept to a comfortable victory to retain the parliamentary seat, winning 34.8 percent of the vote. Sharif s PML-N had 18.9 percent, narrowly coming in third to the regionally strong Awami National Party that won just 40 more votes. But the gains by the Labaik party - formed just last year -  have grabbed attention. Labaik draws most of its support from the Barelvi branch of Sunni Islam, the largest sect in Pakistan that is traditionally considered moderate. Though the party does not publicly talk about its funding, the Barelvis have a network of mosques and madrassa religious schools that collect donations. The party emerged out of a protest movement against the state s execution of Mumtaz Qadri, a bodyguard of the governor of Punjab province who gunned down his boss in 2011 over his call to reform Pakistan s blasphemy laws, among the world s harshest, to prevent abuses. Qadri is considered a hero by the party, and its candidate in Peshawar, Muhammad Shafiq Ameeni, was equally supportive of Mashal Khan s killers, although the student s death was not a main feature at campaign rallies.  It was state s responsibility to punish a blasphemer, no two opinions, but when state doesn t do its job and someone does kill, he shouldn t be punished as a murderer,  Amini said, referring to the 57 people who face trial over Mashal Khan s death. In Pakistan, allegiance to Islam is the official line of most major parties, but ultra-religious parties have so far remained on the fringes.  Labaik is one of two new ultra-religious parties formed in roughly the past year. Together, Labaik and the Milli Muslim League (MML) gained about 11 percent of the vote in last month s by-election in Lahore and 10.4 percent in Peshawar, whereas the established religious parties, such as Jamaat-e-Islami and Jamaat Ulema-e-Islam, combined had 5.3 percent in the 2013 national election. Blasphemy is such an effective wedge issue in Pakistan because there is almost no defense against an accusation. For that reason, say critics, blasphemy laws are often invoked to settle personal scores and to intimidate liberal journalists, lawyers and politicians. Dozens of Pakistanis are sitting on death row after being convicted of insulting Islam s prophet, a specific charge that carries a mandatory death sentence, though no executions have been carried out in recent decades. Now, political parties may be in danger of facing blasphemy accusations themselves.  Earlier in October, the PML-N found itself in the middle of a firestorm when it voted through seemingly small changes to the nation s electoral law. The changes, among other things, turned a religious oath in the electoral laws stating that Mohammad was the last prophet of Muslims into a declaration using the words  I declare .  The alterations prompted accusations of blasphemy from the religious right and the government quickly retreated, terming the change a  clerical  mistake and apologizing in parliament. Labaik has vowed to hold a mass rally on Nov. 6 to demand the lawmakers responsible be prosecuted for blasphemy. Even before the Labaik party s political debut, politicians found promising swift action against blasphemers an easy way to appeal to conservative voters. In March, then-prime minister Sharif issued a public order to prosecute anyone posting blasphemous content online. The next month, Mashal Khan was accused of online blasphemy and beaten to death by fellow students and religious activists  as onlookers filmed the scene. Sharif said he was  shocked and saddened  by the  senseless display of mob justice . At least 67 people have been killed over unproven blasphemy allegations since 1990, according human rights groups. Mashal Khan s father, Iqbal, said his son was the victim of false rumors. The family has received death threats from right-wingers and Mashal s sisters had to drop out of school.  The snakes our country nurtured are now biting us,  the father said, two days before the Peshawar by-election, standing beside his son s gave strewn with flowers, lace and poetry.  Learning of the Labaik party s gains a few days later only made him more pessimistic about the government s ability to stop abuse of blasphemy accusations.  I know very well, I m not going to get my son back,  he said.  But this only adds to my pain.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Equatorial Guinea leader's son found guilty of embezzlement by French court,"PARIS (Reuters) - Millions of euros of assets belonging to the son of Equatorial Guinea s president were ordered to be seized by a French court that found him guilty in absentia on Friday of using money plundered from his country to buy property and luxury cars. The Paris court found Teodorin Obiang, 48, guilty of embezzlement, and ordered the confiscation of more than 100 million euros worth of his French assets. Obiang denied the charges. Obiang, eldest son of President Teodoro Obiang and a vice president himself, was also handed a three-year suspended prison sentence and a suspended 30 million euros ($34.78 million) fine. The court president cited the slow response from parts of the French banking system in contributing to those penalties being suspended and hence more lenient. The case is the first of several to reach court in a broader judicial investigation into allegations of illicit acquisitions in France by long-time leaders and family relatives in several African countries including Gabon and Congo Republic. Obiang s luxury residence on Paris  Avenue Foch - a grand, sweeping road near the Arc de Triomphe often favoured by wealthy African expatriates and politicians - was among the assets scrutinised during the trial. The property, bought for 25 million euros in 2005, had 101 rooms, a gym, hair-dressing studio and disco with cinema screen. Paris prosecutor Jean-Yves Lourgouilloux said Obiang s  fraudulent spending  amounted to more than 150 million euros. The court was critical of Societe Generale, France s second biggest bank, and the Bank of France, deeming them complacent towards Obiang s finances and too slow to react. The role of the two banks was taken into account to justify the suspended sentences for Obiang, the court said.  The attitude of Societe Generale, similar to that of the Bank of France, may have led (Obiang) to think for a long period of time that there was, in France, some kind of tolerance for these practices,  Benedicte de Perthuis, the most senior judge sitting in the case, told the court. Societe Generale said it had not been a party in the trial and  therefore we don t have any particular comment to make . Officials at the Bank of France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     Obiang was first put on trial in January but the case, 10 years in the works, was postponed after his lawyers argued they had not had enough time to prepare his defence. His father, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has ruled Equatorial Guinea - a former Spanish colony - for more than three decades, making him one of Africa s longest-serving leaders, and rights groups have labelled his administration as one of the world s most corrupt.

U.S. wants Pakistan to act quickly to show support in countering militants,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States wants Pakistan to move quickly to show good faith in supporting efforts to counter militants operating in Afghanistan and in bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table, the senior U.S. diplomat for South Asia said on Friday. Speaking after accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on a visit to the region, including Pakistan, Alice Wells said Washington looked forward to seeing practical steps from Pakistan  over the next few weeks and months.   The secretary stressed the importance of Pakistan moving quickly to demonstrate good faith and efforts to use its influence to create the conditions that will get the Taliban to the negotiating table,  Wells, the acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters. Wells said Pakistan s long-standing relationships with militant organizations was a threat to its own stability and said the Taliban leadership and the allied Haqqani network still retained the ability to plan and recuperate and reside with their families in Pakistan. She said Washington wanted Pakistan to show the same commitment it had made to defeat militant groups domestically to those threatening Afghanistan or India.  It s up to them whether or not they want to work with us,  Wells said.  And if they don t ... then we ll adjust accordingly.  Wells declined to elaborate on what action the United States might take or what specific actions it wanted Pakistan to take. Relations between uneasy allies United States and Pakistan have frayed in recent years, with Washington repeatedly accusing Islamabad of helping Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants who stage attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies doing so. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough with Pakistan unless it changed its behavior, with U.S. officials threatening further reductions in aid and mooting targeted sanctions against Pakistani officials. On Monday, during a visit to Kabul, Tillerson urged Pakistan to act against safe havens on its soil.  Pakistan needs to, I think, take a clear-eyed view of the situation that they are confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organizations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan,  he said. Pakistani officials bristle at the idea that the country is not doing enough against militants and say Pakistan has suffered more than 60,000 casualties in the war on terror since the Sept. 11 attacks in United States in 2001.

"Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga agree on ceasefire, Kurdistan says","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters reached an agreement on Friday to stop fighting in northern Iraq, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said, although the status of any ceasefire remained unclear. A spokesman in Baghdad for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State earlier said the deal covered all fronts in the conflict, which broke out after Kurdish authorities held an independence referendum last month in areas of northern Iraq. However, he later told Reuters that the truce had not been officially agreed, while an Iraqi military spokesman declined to comment. According to the KRG, which is based in the Kurdish autonomous region s capital of Erbil, the ceasefire entered effect at 1 am on Friday (2200 GMT Thursday).  The ceasefire is holding,  Vahal Ali, the director of KRG President Masoud Barzani s media office, told Reuters.  Diplomatic efforts are underway to set a date for talks to start between Erbil and Baghdad.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi urging for dialogue to start, the Iraqi central government said in a statement. Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed militias and Kurdish troops fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country. Iraqi government forces and the Tehran-backed Popular Mobilisation launched a surprise offensive on Oct. 16 in retaliation to the Sept. 25 independence referendum organized by the KRG.  The offensive aims to capture disputed territories, claimed by both the KRG and the Iraqi central government, as well as border crossings and oil facilities. The city of Kirkuk, which lies in an oil producing area,  fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16 but the Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the Kurdish autonomous region. The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner where Peshmerga are defending land crossings to Turkey and Syria and an oil hub that controls KRG crude exports, located in the region of Fish-Khabur. Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, Tillerson said he was  disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution  and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG  overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution .  Both parties are talking with one another, but it is not an official ceasefire,  U.S. Colonel Ryan Dillon, the spokesman of the U.S.-led coalition in Baghdad, told Reuters, correcting an earlier statement in which he said a ceasefire had been agreed, In an interview with Kurdish TV Rudaw, Dillon called on the two sides to extend the deal to a complete halt in hostility and  refocus our efforts on defeating ISIS .  We are encouraging dialogue, we are trying to get the tensions down,  he added. Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks.  We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the Constitution,  he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran. The KRG proposed on Wednesday an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and  starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution . The fall of Kirkuk was a major blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by Barzani, as it halved the region s oil export revenue. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
"Once again, Kenya delays election in some areas over risk of violence","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan authorities said on Friday they would indefinitely delay further attempts to hold a repeat presidential election in some areas due to the risk of violence, as the opposition rejected the re-run as  a sham  and said the polls should be canceled. The east African nation had been due to hold elections on Saturday in four western counties, after residents blocked roads and clashed with police on during an attempt to hold the polls there on Thursday. But those plans have been largely put on hold, the election board said.  Opposition leader Raila Odinga pulled out of the contest earlier this month, saying the contest against President Uhuru Kenyatta was not going to be fair.  He urged supporters not to take part in the vote and polling stations were unable to open in his strongholds in the west of the country on Thursday. In the rest of Kenya, most polling stations were able to open, but turnout was below 35 percent and there were clashes in Nairobi slums and in the coastal city of Mombasa.  Kenyatta has won over 97 percent of votes counted so far, according to a local media tally, but the poor turnout has damaged his second-term mandate. Pockets of violence continued on Friday, with police saying they shot dead one man, bringing to five the number of confirmed deaths since voting began on Thursday. All were killed in the west of the country, which supports the opposition. In the Nairobi slum of Kawangware, a Reuters witness saw nearly 100 youths armed with machetes in red T-shirts - the color of the ruling party - as a group of opposition supporters clashed with police. A large fire burned nearby.   It s only fire, everything is burned down, the fire is spreading more and more - my neighbors  homes, businesses are all burnt,  said a tearful Rosalind Njeri, 28.  The vote has exposed Kenya s deep political and ethnic divisions as violence flares and court cases drag on. It is being closely watched as Kenya is a regional trade and logistics hub and powerful security ally for Western nations. Kisumu election officials, who have had to cower behind locked doors while the popping sounds of tear gas and live gunfire echoed nearby, said they were very relieved not to have to try to open polling stations.   The (election board) officers in Nairobi were not taking consideration of our lives,  one said.  This is better.  Musalia Mudavadi, a senior opposition leader, had earlier accused authorities of  ethnic profiling  and having  militarised elections  as they beef up security ahead of the plan to hold voting in Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya counties on Saturday.      We advise the people not to walk into this trap of death,  he told reporters on Friday. Kenya s first election, in August, was annulled by the courts because of procedural irregularities, denying Kenyatta a simple victory over his political rival. Turnout in that election was 80 percent.         If the expected legal challenges fail to clear a path out of the crisis, including a possible order for another re-run, the result will be a protracted and economically damaging political stalemate between the Kenyatta and Odinga camps.  Unless the courts annul the election, Kenyatta will move forward without a clear mandate and Odinga will pursue a protest strategy whose chances of success in the circumstances are not very high,  International Crisis Group analyst Murithi Mutiga said. The division was neatly captured in local media, with the Standard, a leading tabloid, headlining its front page:  One Kenya, two faces.  The election commission said more than one in 10 polling stations failed to open due to  security challenges . Its chairman, Wafula Chebukati, tweeted overnight that 6.55 million ballots had been cast - just 34.5 percent of registered voters. A tally of results announced at the constituency level compiled by the Nation media group showed Kenyatta had won over 96 percent of the vote with 200 of 292 constituencies announced. Figures released by the election commission showed turnout in Kenyatta s Rift Valley and Central region strongholds was similar to levels seen in August. However, the boycott call was heeded by voters on the coast, which is far from his western homeland and saw little violence but has overwhelmingly supported Odinga in previous polls. Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote, raising fears of sustained violence only a decade after 1,200 people were killed in serious ethnic fighting triggered by another disputed vote.

I have always said that I have one interlocutor in Spain, it is Prime Minister Rajoy,  Macron told journalists on the sidelines of a visit to French Guiana.  There is a rule of law in Spain with constitutional rules. Mariano Rajoy wants these rules to be respected and he has my full support,  Macron added. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who was accompanying Macron, also said it was important to avoid any splits and  fractures  in the European Union bloc.  I do not want a situation where, tomorrow, the European Union is made up of 95 different states. We need to avoid splits, because we already have enough splits and fractures and we do not need any more,  said Juncker.

Ukrainian lawmaker blames Russia for deadly Kiev blast,"KIEV (Reuters) - A Ukrainian lawmaker wounded in an explosion in Kiev that killed two people blamed Russia on Thursday for the blast while investigators said they were considering various motives for what they called an act of terrorism. Ihor Mosiychuk, a member of the populist opposition Radical Party, was hospitalized but did not suffer life-threatening injuries, while his bodyguard and a passerby were killed. Two others were wounded. Since fighting with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine broke out in 2014, the number of incidents involving explosives outside the conflict zone has increased. There has been a spate of vehicle bombings over the past 18 months in Kiev, the capital, and elsewhere, but investigators have failed to find those responsible.  Ukraine s state security service (SBU) said that unknown perpetrators had rigged a motorcycle with explosives on Wednesday that detonated as the lawmaker left a TV station. Radical party leader Oleg Lyashko said he had no doubt the incident was politically motivated, while Mosiychuk blamed Russia.  I believe that the initiators are in Moscow, the executors are in Kiev,  Mosiychuk said on Facebook. Russian involvement is one of the possible motives being investigated, deputy Kiev prosecutor Pavlo Kononenko told journalists.  Another explanation is Mosiychuk s political activity, his public position within our country,  he said.  A third explanation is an attempt on Mosiychuk s life for personal reasons.  The Kremlin dismissed the accusations as a product of anti-Russian sentiment.  Beyond all doubt, these are new signs of this anti-Russian campaign which has unfortunately swept across Ukraine and Kiev,  Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Relations between Kiev and Moscow collapsed in 2014 after Russia seized Ukraine s Crimea peninsula and backed a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukrainian regions.      Radical Party lawmaker Evhen Deidei posted photos on his Facebook page from the scene of Wednesday s attack which showed the burnt-out shell of a motorcycle in front of a damaged vehicle.   Judging by the damage to the car and the shrapnel holes in the doors, the power of the explosion was pretty strong,  he said.  There is a lot of blood on the stairs, where Ihor was situated at the time of the explosion.  The interior ministry s Shkiryak said political analyst Vitaliy Bala was one of the three wounded in the blast. In June, a colonel in Ukraine s military intelligence was killed by a car bomb in central Kiev. In 2016 a prominent investigative journalist, Pavel Sheremet, was killed by an explosive device in his car.   ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1

The German government does not recognize such a declaration of independence,  he said, adding that Berlin supported the  clear position  of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in his bid to restore calm and order.

Hopes fade for 8 Russians missing in Arctic helicopter accident,"OSLO (Reuters) - Hopes of finding survivors from a Russian helicopter which disappeared off the coast of the Arctic Svalbard archipelago faded on Friday as Norwegian rescuers searched in vain for a second day in ice-cold waters. Eight Russian men - five crew and three passengers - were listed as missing by Norway s rescue coordination center, while the location of the Russian-made Mil Mi-8 aircraft remained unknown more than 24 hours after it disappeared. The helicopter was on its way from the abandoned Pyramiden settlement to the coal mining port of Barentsburg where the Russian coal company Arktikugol runs a mine employing Russian and Ukrainian miners.  The assumption is that the helicopter has crashed during the approach two kms north of Kapp Heer,  the Accident Investigation Board said in a statement, referring to the local helicopter base. Snowy weather and high waves were complicating efforts in a region that has almost no daylight at this time of the year, while the air temperature was around minus three degrees Celsius (27 degrees Farenheit). A search using a small, remotely-operated submarine, yielded no sign of the helicopter, the rescue coordinators said, dashing earlier hopes that a submerged wreckage had been located. A somewhat bigger submarine will be flown in and is expected to be operational on Saturday, the rescue center said.  We re still conducting a search and rescue operation. We ve not moved to a recovery phase, and won t do so until the new submarine has completed its search  a spokesman for the Norwegian coordinator said. Located around 700 kms (435 miles) north of the European mainland, Svalbard is governed under a treaty that grants NATO-member Norway sovereignty while allowing other signatories to do business and exploit natural resources. More than 40 countries are parties to the treaty. Moscow has maintained a presence on the islands for decades as a strategic foothold in the high north. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1

Burundi takes steps to extend president's rule as crisis deepens,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Burundi s cabinet backed a constitutional change that would allow its president to stay in office until 2034, widening a political rift that has driven the country progressively deeper into crisis. Under existing laws, Burundian presidents are limited to two five-year terms. Unrest that has gripped Burundi since April 2015, when Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would stand for a third, has killed hundreds, left the economy moribund and forced about 400,000 people to seek safety in neighboring countries. UN rights investigators and independent activists have accused government forces of widespread violations including forced disappearances, and of orchestrating a campaign of terror.  A senior government official told Reuters on Friday that the cabinet adopted the draft legislation seeking to amend the constitution on Tuesday. Nkurunziza, who has been in office since 2005, won re-election in July 2015 in a ballot that critics said violated the constitution and the terms of an agreement that ended a previous rebellion.  Nkurunziza s backers said the country s constitutional court had cleared him to run again, but some opponents took up arms against his rule and insecurity has plagued the country since.  Other African leaders have in the recent past also tinkered with or defied their constitutions to extend their rule, including Uganda s President Yoweri Museveni, Rwanda s Paul Kagame and Democratic Republic of Congo s Joseph Kabila. Proposed amendments under the Burundian bill seek to abolish the two-term limit and lengthen presidential terms to seven years. Incumbents would be able to serve two consecutive terms of seven years each and also be eligible to seek re-election after an interregnum. If the amendment was passed by parliament,  the current head of state can rule until 2034,  the source said. A second official told Reuters the government would hold a referendum on the draft legislation next year, but did not say which month. Opposition officials have criticized the legislation which they say was initiated in secrecy and designed to entrench Nkurunziza in power.   No one knew what was being done. It was done in total secrecy...we will always oppose it,  deputy president of the opposition FRODEBU party, Leonce Ngendakumana, told Reuters.  The constitution should not be revised in a tense social climate.   ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
U.N. special envoy urges Poland to open up debate on judicial reform,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s political establishment must open up negotiations on proposals to reform the country s courts to avoid further damage to the country s judicial system, a United Nations envoy urged on Friday. Secrecy surrounding the proposals, if not dispelled, could do lasting harm to Poland s court system, said Diego Garcia-Sayan, a UN special rapporteur on the independence of the judiciary. The proposed changes  risk hampering the capacity of judicial authorities to ensure checks and balances and protect and promote human rights,  Garcia-Sayan said at a briefing after a four-day mission to Warsaw. Poland s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party is embroiled in a confrontation with President Andrzej Duda over reforming the court system. The standoff began in July, when the president, a PiS ally, unexpectedly vetoed bills that would have changed the makeup of the Supreme Court and how judges are chosen. PiS says the judicial system needs to be reformed because the courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist-era mentality. But critics of the plans say they are part of a drive toward authoritarianism.  Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of PiS and Poland s paramount politician, has since met privately with Duda four times for talks on the reforms. Details of those meetings have been kept secret, and it is not known whether a consensus is in sight. Garcia-Sayan said it was difficult to understand how in a democracy work on major legal reforms could take place behind closed doors.  It s not a technicality that s being discussed, but a major thing that will have to do with justice, checks and balances, and so on,  he said.  So, a major suggestion is, please, open political, substantial dialogue.  He added that the judiciary reform that PiS has been pushing  since coming to power in late 2015 has been presented as a cure, but  appears to be worse than the disease affecting the Polish judiciary.   Garcia-Sayan s comments were  not supported by facts  and were  harmful for Poland and the Polish people , Rafal Bochenek, a government spokesman, told Poland s state news agency, PAP.

Islamic State shores up last stronghold on Syria-Iraq border,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Islamic State is building up its defenses in a pocket of territory on the Syrian-Iraqi frontier, the U.S.-led coalition said on Friday, in an anticipation of assaults by Syrian and Iraqi forces aiming to snuff out the jihadists  last stronghold.     Iraq launched an offensive on Thursday to capture the last Iraqi territory held by Islamic State, the areas of Rawa and al-Qaim, a town just over the border from the Syrian town of Albu Kamal, which is also held by the jihadists.  Right now, we are seeing the buildup of (IS) defenses in both al-Qaim and in Albu Kamal,  Colonel Ryan Dillon told Reuters by phone, adding that Islamic State s leadership had shifted to Albu Kamal from towns deeper into Syria. Albu Kamal is in the crosshairs of both the U.S.-led coalition and the Syrian government and its Iranian-backed militia allies. Pro-Damascus forces, who are also backed by the Russian air force, said on Thursday they would march on the town  having driven IS out of a base some 70 km (40 miles) away. Dillon said Albu Kamal was  definitely  a target for the coalition but said it would be up to the leadership of the coalition s Syrian allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), to take the decision on a ground assault. The SDF s priority for now was to shore up its control over the al-Omar oil field, Syria s largest, which was captured from IS on Sunday, he said.  Right now, we have to consolidate that area in and around Omar oilfield and the area that led up to it to make sure that that area is secure, and then it ll be the SDF leadership decision if they can allocate the right resource to adequately push into Albu Kamal,  he said. Assisted by the coalition, the SDF is fighting IS on the eastern banks of the Euphrates, whereas the Syrian army and its allies, supported by Russian air power, is largely fighting on the western banks of the river. Dillon said IS fighters were now  much different fighters  from the ones the U.S.-led coalition fought leading up to the battle for Mosul, the Iraqi city recaptured from IS in June.  We have not seen this fight to the death that we saw in Mosul, and I think it is attributed much to their morale,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1

South African farmers jailed for forcing black man into coffin,"MIDDELBURG, South Africa (Reuters) - Two white South African farmers who were filmed pushed a wailing black man into a coffin were sentenced to jail on Friday for attempted murder, assault and kidnapping. The 20-second video, widely circulated on social media last year, shows the victim, Victor Mlotshwa, cowering inside a coffin as one man pushes the lid down and the other threatens to put petrol and a snake inside. The defendants - Theo Jackson, sentenced to 14 years, and Willem Oosthuizen, sentenced to 11 years - had pleaded not guilty. They said they had caught Mlotshwa trespassing on their farm in possession of stolen copper cables. The case, heard at a court in Middelburg, about 160 km (100 miles) east of the capital, Pretoria, has caused outrage in a country where deep racial divides persist 23 years after the end of apartheid. When she handed down the sentences, Judge Segopotje Mphahlele said she was appalled that the accused had put Mlotshwa into a coffin.  The evidence before court indicates that the seriousness of the offence far outweighs the mitigating factors and the personal factors of the offenders,  she said.  The conduct of the accused fueled social division and racial tension.      The defense immediately requested that it be allowed to appeal the sentence, but Mphahlele dismissed their application. The defense then said it would lodge their appeal directly to the Supreme Court of Appeal, saying that the sentence was too harsh, since no one had been killed. South Africa s Justice Minister Michael Masutha said the sentence could serve as a deterrent to others.  South Africa is no longer prepared to treat racism with kid gloves and we are ready to act,  Justice Minister Michael Masutha said in an interview with eNCA. A large crowd formed outside the packed courtroom. The police presence around the court was heavy.  What they did was painful to us,  Qgoga Mnyamezeli said outside the court. Hundreds of members of the country s main political parties, including the ruling African National Congress and the main opposition Democratic Alliance party, gathered outside carrying placards, some which said  Black Lives Matter! , and shouting slogans in support of Mlotshwa. Black people make up 80 percent of South Africa s 54 million population, but most its wealth remains in the hands of whites, who account for about 8 percent of the population.

"Out of Russian custody, Tatar leaders vow to return to Crimea","KIEV (Reuters) - Two Crimean Tatar activists released from Russian custody this week said on Friday they would travel back to the annexed peninsula and campaign for the freedom of other political prisoners and the return of Crimea to Ukraine. The Tatars, a mainly Muslim Turkic minority in Crimea, have largely opposed Russian rule since the 2014 annexation. Moscow has been accused of violating the rights of the community, 50 of whose members are still imprisoned on political grounds, according to the Kiev authorities.  Ilmi Umerov, deputy head of the Crimean Tatars  semi-official Mejlis legislature, and fellow Tatar leader Ahtem Chiygoz, were released unexpectedly on Wednesday.  Whether they allow me or not, I will go home without fail,  Umerov told journalists after flying back to Kiev.  I m sure that if things continue like this then the topic of Crimea will not drop out of the newspaper pages and the process will continue of freeing people, gradually de-occupying Crimea and restoring Ukraine s territorial integrity,  he said. Umerov, who had been sentenced to two years in Russian prison for separatism, credited international pressure on the Kremlin for his early release.  Earlier, they had flown to Turkey to meet Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, whom Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has thanked for helping free the pair.  Umerov s supporters said at the time that the two-year jail term handed to him actually amounted to a death penalty since he suffers from Parkinson s disease. Russian officials denied the prosecutions were politically-motivated. Chiygoz said their release did not feel like a return to freedom.  Because a release would be the liberation of my people, my land, my homeland, my country,  he said. According to a U.N. human rights report, Russia is committing  grave  human rights violations in Crimea, including by imposing Russian citizenship and deporting prisoners. Russia seized Crimea in the wake of a pro-European uprising in Kiev that ousted a Moscow-backed president. It replaced Ukrainian laws with Russian laws on the peninsula, but its annexation has never been internationally recognized. Crimean Tatars are traditionally pro-Ukrainian, as they suffered mass deportation to Central Asia under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Since the annexation, they have been subjected to intimidation, house searches and arbitrary detention, rights groups say. Moscow says the overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to join Russia in a proper and fair referendum. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1

Britain sets Monday as latest deadline for Northern Ireland political talks,"BELFAST (Reuters) - Britain will have to bring in legislation to set a budget for Northern Ireland if the province s political parties cannot reach an agreement to restore their power-sharing government by Monday, a British government spokesman said. Northern Ireland has been without a regional administration since its collapse in January, raising the prospect of direct rule being reimposed from London, potentially destabilizing a delicate political balance in the British province. The British minister for the region, James Brokenshire, said last week that talks had stalled with the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) stuck over the rights of Irish language speakers.   If a deal is struck by Monday, Brokenshire would return to London to begin the processes required to form a new Northern Ireland Executive, the spokesman added. However, if a budget is imposed by London, it would be the closest Northern Ireland has come to a return to direct rule in a decade. Brokenshire has warned the parties that they are on  a glide path to greater and greater UK government intervention . The DUP and Sinn Fein shared power in the previous devolved administration under a system created following a peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province. The head of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), one of the region s smaller parties, has said that handing over budgetary responsibility to London effectively constitutes direct rule and  cannot be painted any other way . Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said a new phase of talks would begin if an agreement could not be struck by Monday.  If there is no deal done by the time the British minister brings forward a budget, that will signify that this phase of the talks - and there will obviously have to be other phases - has been exhausted,  Adams told Irish national broadcaster RTE. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who is co-facilitating the talks with Brokenshire, has said reverting to direct rule would be a  devastating  blow for reconciliation in the region. Coveney has also urged the parties to reach a deal so that Northern Ireland can have a greater say in Britain s talks to leave the European Union, set to have a bigger impact on the province than on any other part of the United Kingdom.

Hamas says its security chief wounded in Gaza car bombing,"GAZA (Reuters) - Hamas  security chief in the Gaza Strip was wounded in a car bombing on Friday in what the Islamist group called a failed assassination attempt. The attack came as rival factions are trying to implement a new agreement meant to end a 10-year rift that has effectively split the Palestinian territories between Hamas in Gaza and the more mainstream Fatah in the occupied West Bank. Tawfeeq Abu Naeem, Hamas  head of security in Gaza and a strong supporter of the reconciliation deal, was lightly wounded when his car exploded outside a mosque, Hamas said in a statement. Hamas, which has been quick to blame Israel for similar attacks in the past, did not say who it believed was behind the bombing, suggesting it could also be the work of a radical jihadist Salafi group that opposes the Palestinian rapprochement. Asked about the explosion in Gaza, Israel s military said it did not comment on foreign reports. Hamas has stepped up a security campaign against Salafi groups and recently detained a senior operative. Hamas also has improved ties with Egypt, which is battling Islamist groups across the border in the Sinai peninsula. Some disputes arose this week in implementing the reconciliation deal. Senior Fatah officials traveled to Gaza this week from the West Bank to take control of two government offices there, but they turned back, saying Hamas officials refused their authority. A Fatah spokesman later said the issue was being resolved. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1

The test launches, conducted on Thursday, involved land, air, and submarine-based ballistic missiles, Russia s defense ministry said in a separate statement.

"Leave the past behind, Bulgarian PM tells Balkan leaders","SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Western Balkan countries aspiring to join the European Union should leave the past behind and solve their mutual problems first, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said on Friday. The EU won t do it for them, he said. Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia are official candidates for EU membership while Bosnia and Kosovo are seeking the same status. But past rivalries are still hurting relations between some of the countries which were embroiled in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Borissov said that Bulgaria, Austria and Romania, the three countries which will chair the EU presidency over the next two years, were ready to support the accession of these countries into the wealthy bloc but a key for the progress was compromise by their political elites.  Nobody can help unless we realize that the past needs to remain in the past and that we need to move forward,  Borissov said at a news conference during an official visit to Sarajevo.  Unresolved matters must be resolved today along with all political sacrifices that need to be made.   This cannot be solved by Europe, which has its problems and fears,  Borissov said.  The pace of Serbia s integration into the 27-member bloc was made conditional on the progress of a dialogue with its former province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008.  In Bosnia, inter-ethnic tensions have risen after Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats had revived aspirations for greater territorial autonomies within the country they share with Muslim Bosniaks, relying on their wartime allies Serbia and Croatia. Borissov said that  radical Islam is a problem  but that his Bosnian counterpart Denis Zvizic has assured him that Bosnia was not under the threat of radicalized Muslims.  Islam in Bosnia is certainly one of most tolerant forms of Islam practised in the world and any kind of radicalization has not and will not be allowed,  Zvizdic said at the same news conference. In September, the EU confirmed its pledge for a credible enlargement perspective for the region, which it sees as important for issues from controlling immigration to countering security threats ranging from alleged interference of Russia to radical Islam.

Zimbabwe's opposition leader Tsvangirai back in South African hospital,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai is back in a South African hospital for a medical review, nearly two weeks after he returned home from that country, his spokesman said on Friday, denying reports that he was critically ill. Tsvangirai, who suffered severe vomiting after a party meeting and was in September airlifted to a Johannesburg hospital where he spent nearly a month receiving treatment and recuperating. He returned to Zimbabwe on Oct. 13 but has not been seen in public since.  He came back knowing full well he would return for a review and he went for the review as scheduled,  Luke Tamborinyoka, Tsvangirai s spokesman said.  He could not say when he expected Tsvangirai back.     Tsvangirai s illness has divided the opposition, with some senior party officials saying the former trade unionist should consider stepping down to make way for a younger and fit leader. Tsvangirai, 65, declared last year that he was receiving treatment for colon cancer. Despite the illness, he is leading an opposition alliance to challenge 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe in elections next year. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1

Brexit drives Belgium to set up English-language commerce court,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium will set up an English-language commercial court to deal with disputes between international companies to make the most of Britain s plan to leave the European Union. The Brussels International Business Court (BIBC) will seek to take on cases that are so far handled by British courts or international arbitration tribunals, the Belgian government said on Friday. Cases in Belgium s regular courts are heard in French or Dutch. The government said the demand for arbitration was likely to grow because of Brexit.  The same Brexit means moreover that going to a court in London might not be an appropriate option,  it said, without giving a date for the start of the English-language hearings. BIBC will be presided over by sector specialists and parties will have to agree in advance to let the court settle their differences. They will not be able to appeal against the decisions.  The development of the European Union cannot be slowed down by Brexit. Our country uses this opportunity to offer a new judicial instrument,  Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said in a statement. Some companies, such as Lloyd s of London, the world s largest specialty insurance market, have already picked Brussels as their European base in order to retain access to the EU market after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019.

Hungary's Jobbik supports EU deepening with voters' blessing,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary s main opposition Jobbik party could support deeper European integration, its chairman said on Friday, in a shift apparently aimed at bringing the far-right group closer to the political mainstream. Jobbik, which used to burn EU flags and was widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism, has tried over the past few years to convince voters it has become a more moderate conservative party that supports democratic institutions and civil rights. Chairman Gabor Vona told foreign journalists Jobbik does not want a two-speed EU, in which some member states would enjoy a lesser level of cooperation than others. Instead, it favored waiting until Europe s integration plans became clearer and then holding referendums across the EU to see which countries want to stay in. He also said Jobbik would be willing to join the euro zone as fast as economically sensible, which he called an economic issue, rather than a political one. Jobbik is a distant second behind the ruling Fidesz party in opinion polls ahead of elections due in April 2018, but it says poll results might be misleading with many voters hiding their preferences. Its policy proposals have often been echoed by Fidesz, which is also a right-wing party with strong anti-immigration views, but which has been seen as closer to the European conservative mainstream than more explicitly nationalist Jobbik. Vona said Europe was likely to transform in the next few years. Countries should wait for the bloc s trajectory to become clearer, and then all EU states should hold referendums on whether to remain members.  A referendum about membership would be legitimate but not now,  he said.  What would we vote about? The Juncker plan? The Merkel plan? The Macron plan? We have no idea what the EU means at this moment. We should clarify this together first.   Once we have that we should ask everywhere, not only in Hungary, whether people want whatever Brussels leaders cooked up or not.  Hungarians have warmed considerably to the EU in recent months. According to Eurobarometer, 56 percent of them now say EU membership is a  good thing , up 8 percentage points since March. That is the steepest rise in the EU. Vona said Hungary should join the euro currency as soon as possible, once public debt and competitiveness are appropriate. Ostracised in Brussels even by other far-right groups, Jobbik says it seeks to transcend traditional left-right political divisions and find new allies in the European Parliament after elections to the body in 2019.  We would be happy to see... a regional alliance of central European politicians who can look past left and right and embody common Eastern issues,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
"Ahead of Trump trip, China urges U.S. not to allow Taiwan president in","BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China urged the United States on Friday not to allow Taiwan s president to travel through U.S. territory en route to the island s diplomatic allies in the Pacific, a sensitive visit shortly ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump s trip to Beijing.  China considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province ineligible for state-to-state relations and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.  China regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States, and Beijing always complains to Washington about transit stops by Taiwanese presidents. President Tsai Ing-wen leaves on Saturday on a weeklong trip to three Pacific island allies - Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands - via Honolulu and Guam. In a statement on Friday, a Taiwanese government spokesman said Tsai s trip was aimed at strengthening ties with friendly nations and also to provide support for the island s frontline diplomats. It said Taiwan was grateful to the United States for helping to arrange the stopovers  in accordance with comfort, safety, convenience and dignity principles.  Grace Choi, the State Department spokeswoman for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said Tsai would transit Hawaii Oct. 27-29 and Guam Nov. 3-4. Choi said Tsai s transits would be  private and unofficial  and were based on long-standing U.S. practice consistent with  our unofficial relations with Taiwan.  She noted the transits were out of consideration for the safety and convenience of the traveler and there was  no change to the U.S. one-China policy.  Ambassador James Moriarty, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, the organization that carries out unofficial U.S. relations with Taiwan, will greet Tsai in Hawaii and Guam, Choi said. Trump is due to visit China in less than two weeks. He angered Beijing last December by taking a telephone call from Tsai shortly after he won the presidential election. China has made  stern representations  to the United States over the matter, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, urging the United States to strictly abide by the  one China  policy.   China hopes the United States does not allow Tsai  to transit, not send any wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces and take real actions to protect the overall picture of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait , Geng told a news briefing. The trip to the United States will be Tsai s second this year. In January she stopped over in Houston and San Francisco on her way to and from Latin America, visiting the headquarters of micro-messaging service Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), which is blocked in China, while in California. In Houston, she met Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Texas Governor Greg Abbott. She also spoke by telephone with U.S. Senator John McCain, head of the powerful Senate Committee on Armed Services.      China suspects Tsai wants to push for the formal independence of Taiwan, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s democracy and security. China has pressured Taiwan since Tsai took office last year, suspending a regular dialogue mechanism and slowly peeling away its few remaining diplomatic allies. Just 20 countries now maintain formal ties with Taiwan, instead of China, mostly small states in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island s main source of arms. Tsai s call with Trump was the first between U.S. and  Taiwan leaders since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 1979. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Vietnam dissident's daughter calls on Melania Trump for help,"(Reuters) - The 10-year-old daughter of a jailed Vietnamese blogger,  Mother Mushroom , has appealed to U.S. First Lady Melania Trump to help win her mother s release ahead of President Donald Trump s visit to Vietnam next month. The handwritten letter, posted on Facebook on Thursday, drew attention to Vietnam s biggest crackdown on dissidents in years before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November. Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, 37, known as  Me Nam  (Mother Mushroom), is one of Vietnam s most prominent activists. She was jailed for 10 years in June for publishing anti-state reports, including one about deaths in police custody. Her daughter Nguyen Bao Nguyen, nicknamed  Mushroom , referred to Trump s upcoming visit to Vietnam and the  International Women of Courage Award  awarded by the First Lady to Quynh in March, which drew an angry response from Hanoi.  Please help my family re-unite because I know my mother did nothing wrong,  Nguyen wrote in the letter, published on Quynh s mother s Facebook Page.  We love our mother so much and just want her to come back to us,  said Nguyen, who turns 11 on Saturday. Vietnam s government did not immediately respond to a request to comment.  The United States has advocated for Ms. Quynh s release, and the release of all prisoners of conscience, multiple times with high-level Vietnamese officials in the run-up to the President s visit to Vietnam   including in recent days and weeks,  U.S. Ambassador Ted Osius told Reuters.  Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, media censorship remains tight in Vietnam and criticism of the Communist state is not tolerated. At least 17 dissidents have been arrested this year in a crackdown that followed changes within the ruling party hierarchy and a growing number of environmental protests. Vietnam has carried out a simultaneous crackdown on corruption. Trump is set to attend the APEC forum in the seaside resort of Danang, besides making an official visit to Vietnam.  International donors and trade partners need to step up pressure on the country s leaders to improve its abysmal rights record, and the APEC summit is a good moment to start,  said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. Quynh s mother, Nguyen Tuyet Lan, is now looking after Nguyen and her four-year-old brother  Bear . She told Reuters:  My daughter did nothing wrong; just consider what she did as constructive criticism for society.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Czech election winner Babis warms to minority government,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The anti-establishment ANO party that won the Czech parliamentary election may form a minority government if other parties remain opposed to forming a coalition, ANO chief Andrej Babis said on Friday. The ANO won 29.6 percent in last weekend s vote, nearly three times as much as the runner-up centre-right Civic Democrats, but fell short of a majority in parliament, a fractious chamber of nine parties. ANO s stance against immigration and corruption in mainstream parties, pledges to bring effective government and a centrist economic program drew voters away from parties that dominated Czech politics from the end of communism, echoing a swing to anti-system and anti-immigrant parties across Europe.  Babis has held talks with the eight other parties holding parliamentary seats but was spurned by all apart from the far-right, anti-European SPD, not his preferred coalition partner.  If we are rejected everywhere, we will try a minority government,  Babis, a billionaire businessman, told the www.idnes.cz website, part of a media group he owned until it was shifted to a trust fund this year.  And we will come with an agenda that partially meets the programs of all parties.  Babis has however also set more rounds of talks with all parties, and said he would wait to see how the situation develops after the new parliament first convenes on Nov. 20. ANO has 78 of the 200 seats in parliament. Most parties shun Babis because he faces charges of fraud. Police say he hid ownership of a farm and conference center near Prague in 2008 so it could qualify for a 2 million euro EU subsidy that was only meant for small business. He denies any wrongdoing and says the charges were politically motivated. Babis s Agrofert group, placed in a trust fund earlier this year, spans over 250 companies in chemicals, food, farming and media around central Europe including Germany. Forbes puts his net worth at $4 billion.    The mix of business, media and political power, plus his domineering style and wish to simplify parliamentary procedures, have prompted accusations that he is a threat to democracy. He denies this, saying he only wants to move the country forward. Pledges not to join a Babis-led cabinet were at the heart of most parties  pre-election agendas, making any turnaround tough despite positions similar to ANO on policies like infrastructure investment, tax cuts and greater government transparency. Babis again sought to dispel fears he would be anti-European fanned by his opposition to adopting the euro currency and deeper European integration, and the possibility his cabinet  could lean on eurosceptic votes from the SPD camp.    I see no reason why we should leave the European Union.  Europe is a project thanks to which we have peace, free movement of people, goods, capital and services,  he told Friday s daily Pravo. Babis added, however, that the EU needed to better protect its external borders against inward migration and draw lessons from Britain s decision to quit the EU largely over sovereignty and immigration issues.

Egypt kills 13 militants in raid on western desert farm,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian security forces killed 13 militants during a raid on a farm hideout in the western desert region on Friday, a week after a deadly attack on a police convoy, authorities said. An Interior Ministry statement gave no details on the militants, but Egyptian forces have been battling several armed Islamist groups, mostly focused on an entrenched Islamic State affiliate that has killed hundreds of police officers and troops in the northern Sinai Peninsula since 2013.  They took a house in the farm as a temporary hideout faraway from security monitoring to receive newly recruited elements and train them and prepare the explosive devices,  the ministry statement said. The clashes were in an area near the Assuit-Kharga desert highway, around 400 km (248.55 miles) southwest of Cairo, in New Valley province that shares a long border with neighboring southern Libya. Southern Libya has become a hideout for militant brigades taking advantage of the security vacuum there.  After clashes with the militants, the ministry said 13 bodies were recovered at the farm, some wearing militant uniforms. Security forces also recovered weapons, suicide bomb belts, cash and ammunition.    The statement did not say whether the group was linked to the militants who attacked police last week in a remote area of Giza governorate, 135 km outside Cairo, when sources say they were searching for a militant hideout.  Security forces dealt a severe blow to the terrorist elements in revenge for the blood of the men who were martyred last week in the oasis,  the state news agency MENA said earlier, citing a high-level security source. Most of Egypt s violence is centered in the northern Sinai, where a local group, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. It had mostly targeted security forces with ambushes and suicide attacks, but has spread to other areas of Egypt outside the peninsula. The western desert region has long been for a route for smugglers and arms coming across Libya s porous border. The Egyptian military said on Monday its air force hit eight four-wheel-drive vehicles carrying arms and explosives at the western border with Libya, killing the militants on board.

Blast hits train in southwestern Pakistan; at least 6 hurt,"QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - At least six people were wounded on Friday when a bomb went off along railway tracks in southwestern Pakistan, halting train service in the region, security and railways officials said.  The train was traveling from Baluchistan s capital of Quetta to the eastern metropolis of Lahore when a blast on the main railway track damaged one of its cars.  One train bogie was damaged in the blast and a portion of the tracks blown up,  said railways official Aammir Baloch, adding that Quetta s train services had been suspended. Security officials said six passengers were injured in the blast.  The Taliban, Sunni Islam militants and sectarian groups linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State group also operate in the strategically important region, which borders Iran and Afghanistan. Baluchistan is at the center of infrastructure projects that form part of China s  Belt and Road  initiative, which has brought $57 billion of investment to Pakistan. Violence in the southwestern region has fueled concern about security for a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan s southern deepwater port of Gwadar. Separatists in Baluchistan, who have long battled the state for a greater share of the resources of the gas- and mineral-rich region, also accuse the central government of discrimination. Separately, two workers of a prominent political party were killed on Friday in a landmine blast in the district of Harnai  near Quetta as they traveled to a party meeting.  The victims were brothers and belonged to the Awami National Party,  regional official Abdul Salam Achakzai told Reuters.   The explosive device was planted by the road,  he added.

"Myanmar gives green light to resume food aid to Rakhine, says U.N.","GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar authorities have agreed to allow the United Nations to resume distribution of food in northern Rakhine state which was suspended for two months, the World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday. The agreement, whose details are still being worked out, came as UNICEF reported that Rohingya refugee children fleeing into Bangladesh were arriving  close to death  from malnutrition. The WFP was previously distributing food rations to 110,000 people in northern Rakhine state - to both Buddhist and the minority Muslim Rohingya communities. Rohingya insurgent attacks on police stations triggered an army crackdown, that the United Nations has called  ethnic cleansing , and U.N. humanitarian agencies have not been able to access northern Rakhine to deliver aid since then. WFP deliveries have continued to 140,000 people in central Rakhine.  WFP has been given the green light to resume food assistance operations in northern part of Rakhine. We are working with the government to coordinate the details,  WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told journalists in Geneva. She had no timeline or details on the proposed distribution of rations to northern Rakhine, and said it was still being discussed with the authorities in Myanmar.  We just have to see what the situation on the ground is. It s very hard to say these things if you can t get in,  Luescher said. Some 604,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh in the past two months, bringing the total to 817,000, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. Malnutrition rates in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships in Rakhine, where the vast majority of the Rohingya refugees originate, were already above emergency threshold rates before the crisis, the U.N. Children s Fund (UNICEF) said.  Since August 25, we have had to stop treating 4,000 children with severe acute malnutrition in northern Rakhine because we have had no access,  UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado told the briefing. UNICEF has screened nearly 60,000 Rohingya refugee children arriving in Bangladesh, nearly 2,000 of whom have been identified as having severe acute malnutrition, with another 7,000 moderately acutely malnourished, she said. The agency screened 340 children among recent arrivals, a  rough and rapid exercise  that found 10 percent to be severely acutely malnourished, she said.   This is an extremely small number of children so these numbers are not representative,  Mercado said.  But what they do tell us is that some of the children are close to death by the time they make it across the border.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
"'Consistent' pattern of crimes against Myanmar's Rohingya, U.N. experts say","GENEVA (Reuters) - Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar have testified that a  consistent, methodical pattern  of killings, torture, rape and arson is taking place, United Nations human rights investigators said on Friday after a first mission to Bangladesh. The fact-finding team, led by former Indonesian attorney general Marzuki Darusman, said the death toll from the Myanmar army s crackdown following Rohingya insurgent attacks on Aug. 25 was unknown, but  may turn out to be extremely high .  We have heard many accounts from people from many different villages across northern Rakhine state. They point to a consistent, methodical pattern of actions resulting in gross human rights violations affecting hundreds of thousands of people,  Darusman said in a statement.  The team of three independent experts spent six days interviewing some of the 600,000 Rohingya from Myanmar s northern Rakhine state who are in refugee camps near Cox s Bazar. An advance team of U.N. rights officers have been conducting comprehensive interviews for weeks, it said.  We are deeply disturbed at the end of this visit,  Darusman said.  Radhika Coomaraswamy, another member and veteran U.N. human rights investigator, said she was left  shaken and angry  by the testimonies.  The accounts of sexual violence that I heard from victims are some of the most horrendous I have heard in my long experience in dealing with this issue in many crisis situations,  she said.  One could see the trauma in the eyes of the women I interviewed. When proven, this kind of abuse must never be allowed to go unpunished.   The U.N. team, which was established by the U.N. Human Rights Council in March, renewed its appeal for access to Rakhine state and for talks with the Myanmar government and military to  establish the facts .  The third member, Christopher Sidoti, said that Rohingyas must be allowed to return to Rakhine if they wish, but only after mechanisms are put in place to ensure their safety.   That may require the placement of international human rights monitors in Rakhine State,  he said.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
"After Iran shock, nervous Europe girds for next Trump salvo","BERLIN (Reuters) - Following Donald Trump s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal this month, shaken European capitals are asking themselves what the U.S. president will do next. Diplomats have sketched scenarios they fear could plunge transatlantic relations into crisis: a trade war, military conflict over North Korea, or the collapse of a Cold War-era arms treaty. They wonder if their post-war alliance can survive if any of them come true. Since Trump took office nine months ago, governments in Berlin, Paris and London have wavered between alarm at his rhetoric and a shaky sense that his worst instincts can be contained by the  grown ups  in his cabinet and pressure from allies. But the Iran decision, taken despite personal appeals from France s Emmanuel Macron, Germany s Angela Merkel and Britain s Theresa May, has changed the calculus in Europe, according to diplomats, politicians and analysts. No longer is there an underlying confidence that Europe can muddle through three more years of Trump without fear of major, and possibly lasting, disruptions to the relationship. Nor is there faith that Trump, when the stakes are high, will listen to what his advisers and partners tell him. The anxiety is especially acute in Germany, whose own identity is anchored in its relationship with the United States and whose reliance on Washington, particularly in defense and security matters, runs deeper than that of France or Britain.  There is a sense of desperation in Berlin, a sense that Trump does not know what is at stake, that he doesn t understand the historical factors that are at play here,  said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington and chairman of the Munich Security Conference.  The transatlantic relationship is all about trust. In that sense, the Iran decision takes us to a new level. It is a breach of trust,  he said. Trump s decision to decertify the Iran deal will not necessarily kill it. That depends on Congress, which must now decide to impose new sanctions against Tehran. But the consensus in Europe is that a landmark diplomatic achievement has been seriously undermined.  Merkel alluded to the breakdown in trust back in May, when she said Europe might not be able to rely on the United States and must take its fate into its own hands. That came after a contentious G7 meeting in Sicily at which Trump ignored pleas from allies to stick with another multilateral agreement, the Paris climate accord. Since then Merkel, focused on an election and efforts to form a coalition, has said little about the transatlantic relationship or Trump. Macron meanwhile, has done his best to charm the American president, inviting him to Paris for Bastille Day celebrations and meeting him again at the United Nations last month.  I don t despair of making him change his mind,  Macron said in New York of Trump s stances on climate and Iran. In private however, European officials say they are worried that Trump s rejection of the Iran deal could be a harbinger of other disruptive salvos from Washington. One senior European diplomat said the next conflict would likely be over trade, describing Trump s attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)   and his threats to abandon it   as a  litmus test . European firms, especially German carmakers who produce in Mexico and export to the United States, could be hit hard by a breakdown of NAFTA. There are also fears that Trump could carry out a threat to introduce steel import tariffs, which would hit European exporters as well as the Chinese.  So far there has been a lot of bark and no bite from Trump on trade, but that doesn t mean it will stay that way,  said the European diplomat.  We have to be prepared for real protectionist measures. Any steps that penalize European firms directly or indirectly would create a downward spiral.  ANTI-AMERICANISM North Korea is another area of concern. Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, believes the reaction in Europe to a military conflict on the Korean peninsula could be  as messy as the Iraq war . The European public could view Washington as the aggressor in such a conflict. This could fuel anti-American sentiment, making it difficult for European leaders to stand with Trump and emboldening voices that are already calling for a break from Washington   no matter how unrealistic that looks in practice.  We have to wake up to the fact that we may be dealing with Trump for some time, and that there may not be a correction when he leaves,  one German diplomat told Reuters.  It hasn t dawned on people here that this is existential and you have to react.  Concerns about such sentiments led a group of a dozen Germany-based foreign policy experts to issue a manifesto this month, entitled  In Spite of It All, America , which warned Berlin against turning its back on Washington because of Trump. Former ambassador Ischinger shares that view. But he too is concerned the relationship could deteriorate further. One of his biggest fears is a collapse of the INF Treaty, a nuclear arms reduction pact signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. Washington and Moscow accuse each other of violating the treaty and Gorbachev himself warned this month that it was in peril. Should the INF unravel, Ischinger believes the divisive 1980s debate about deploying nuclear weapons in Europe could resurface with devastating consequences for transatlantic ties.  All hell could break loose, politically speaking,  he said. For generations of Germans, Ischinger says, the symbol of the transatlantic alliance has been U.S. presidents   from John F. Kennedy to Reagan, and from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama.  I can no longer tell my children that they are part of this alliance with Trump as president,  he said.  It is rather sad. I don t know how the loss of this symbol can be replaced.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Indonesia questions fireworks factory owner after deadly blaze,"KOSAMBI, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian police on Friday started questioning the owner of a fireworks factory destroyed in a series of explosions and a fire that killed 47 workers and injured dozens, leaving some with horrific burns covering up to 80 percent of their bodies. In one of Indonesia s worst industrial disasters, many workers were unable to escape the fire at the plant in Tangerang, an industrial and manufacturing hub near Jakarta, on Thursday. Police and residents broke holes in the walls to help trapped workers forced back by the intense heat from the blaze. On Friday, a pile of sacks was still smoldering as forensics experts searched for human remains. The disaster will throw a new focus on safety standards at workplaces in Indonesia, where rules are often poorly enforced.  Police said the owner of the fireworks company, PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses, had returned to Indonesia to be questioned, along with seven witnesses, mostly administrative staff at the factory.  When he heard about the incident at the factory he was in Malaysia and he flew back straight away and went straight to Tangerang Police,  Jakarta police spokesman Argo Juwono told Metro TV. Earlier, Tangerang police chief Harry Kurniawan told Reuters the cause of the fire was still being investigated and denied reports that the factory gates were locked.  Responding to a report that underage workers were employed at the plant, Kurniawan said investigations had not shown this to be the case. Hospital records seen by Reuters showed two of the injured were aged 15 and 16.  Tangerang General Hospital is treating 12 patients, some for burns over 40 percent to 80 percent of their bodies, said a spokesman, Yudi Firmansyah.    We are expecting treatment to take a long time,  Firmansyah added.  First there s the life-saving stage, then further treatment to prevent infections, and cosmetic procedures.  Ayani, who goes by one name, wept when she saw her severely burnt daughter, Nuhayati, 35, lying on a hospital bed.  Her skin has been burned off completely,  she said, pointing to her forearms, torso and legs, and adding that her daughter had started working at the plant a month ago.  She only had some hair on her head, but her skin is almost gone.  Officials have warned that the death toll could rise, with police saying three people were still unaccounted for. There were some narrow escapes at the factory, staffed mainly by young women paid about $3 a day. Fitri, 18, told Kompas media she survived by submerging herself in a large tub of water used to clean equipment, along with four workers.  If we stay here, we won t be safe,  she eventually told her friends, before climbing a 3-metre (10-ft) wall beside the tub and breaking through the roof. Then residents used a ladder to help her descend.The report said the fire was thought to have started in a holding area next to the front gate where fireworks were stored.         Victims in orange body bags were taken to a police hospital in East Jakarta for identification by families. Sugeng Priyanto, an official at the Ministry of Manpower, told Metro TV a team was investigating safety standards at the warehouse, which had been operating for a few months. Tangerang Regent Ahmed Zaki said the company had a permit to pack and wrap fireworks, though not produce them at the warehouse, which was close to a school and housing. Earlier he had said it had a manufacturing permit. The disaster illustrated the low safety awareness in Indonesia, Jakarta-based Concord Consulting said in a daily report.   Regulations may be in place officially, but too often are simply ignored, resulting in high levels of complacency,  it said.

"Exclusive: Energy, not tech or finance, in CEO line-up for Trump's China visit","BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. energy and commodities firms will make up a major part of a business delegation visiting Beijing at the same time as U.S. President Donald Trump goes to China in November, according to an initial list seen by Reuters. Prominent technology and financial companies are mostly absent from the list, reflecting the slow progress Washington has made in opening up China in those sectors. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who will lead the 29 companies that have been approved to travel on the trade mission starting on Nov. 8, said they will be looking for  immediate results  and  tangible agreements . But, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday, he acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate.  Some major industrial companies - General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc and Boeing Co - are among the companies on the current list. Whether executives from all the named companies end up attending could be subject to agreements or deals being negotiated in time for the visit, according to multiple sources whose companies are involved. One of the few tech companies going with Trump is Qualcomm, which earns about half of its global revenue in China and faces a series of tricky legal issues there, including a lawsuit with Apple and the Chinese government s review of its pending $38 billion merger with NXP Semiconductors. Qualcomm said its CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, planned to attend. An industry source told Reuters tech firms were reluctant to go, given China market access issues, the unpredictability of the Trump administration, and a  Section 301  U.S. trade investigation alleging Chinese abuses of intellectual property.  (These) issues are extremely sensitive for tech companies said another source in the U.S. business community.  Very few want to stick their heads up and be perceived as complaining directly, and even fewer trust this White House to do anything helpful on their issues,  he said. Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations, which mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk. Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, has had a sometimes testy relationship with corporate America since taking office in January.  He disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils in August after several chief executives quit in protest over his controversial remarks on racist violence in Charlottesville. U.S. industry sources say it has been years since a major business delegation has gone to China during a U.S. presidential visit. Calls for such a delegation during Trump s visit originated in the China-based U.S. business community, according to several sources, who saw a need to match growing efforts by Germany, France and Britain to promote their nation s firms in China. Trump, who has frequently cited the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China as a reason why Washington should take more protectionist measures, was an easy sell on incorporating a group of executives into the visit, according to the sources. Nonetheless, some trade analysts say China has done a good job of taming Trump s combative trade impulses. They worry the U.S. administration will be willing to paper over market access concerns during the visit in its focus on getting Beijing to take action against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. Beijing agreed in May to grant limited U.S. access in financial services in bilateral talks aimed at reducing China s trade surplus with the United States which reached $347 billion last year, but business groups complained it was too little, too late. William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters he didn t expect Trump to push hard on market access issues on this trip.  Unfortunately, I think the Chinese aren t going to start to respond until they feel some pain,  Zarit said.  We re all wondering what that is going to mean.  Scott Kennedy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Beijing has deflected commercial issues  using a combination of leadership flattery, coaxing up to his (Trump s) family, token concessions, adjusting their level of help on North Korea sanctions, and threats of retaliation should the U.S. take any unilateral action . Agribusiness and energy firms dominate the delegation list. They include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM), one of the world s largest grain companies, and chemicals and agribusiness giant DowDuPont. Ten of the companies are involved in gas or other energy fields, including Cheniere Energy Inc, which operates the only U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal, three that are building new projects, and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra s vaunted commodities division.[L2N1N109T] Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as its shale revolution contributes to a global LNG glut.  Others on the list who confirmed plans to attend include GE, Houston-based LNG company Delfin Midstream, SolarReserve, Stine Seed Company, biotech firm Drylet, wastewater-processing firm Viroment and the U.S. Soybean Export Council. Bell Helicopter and crane-maker Terex Corp are also on the delegation list. Honeywell, DowDuPont and ADM did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Freepoint, Cheniere, Sempra Energy, and Texas LNG Brownsville LLC said they had no comment. Boeing told Reuters it does not yet have plans to send anyone but that may change. Alaska Gasline Development Corp said it had no information to release. The U.S. Commerce Department, which is leading the delegation, has not yet issued its own list. At least one of the companies on the list tried to distance itself from Trump. SolarReserve told Reuters in a statement that  it had been selected to participate in the commerce department s delegation but stressed that  we are not part of the business delegation travelling to China with President Trump.  One U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Trump will tout deals announced during the trip, but they would have likely happened regardless.  The risk is that commercial deals  distract from long-term political solutions  to trade issues, the official said. Evan Medeiros, former President Barack Obama s top Asia adviser, made a similar point in Washington. Beijing would avoid seriously addressing the  underlying systemic problems  such as market access for high-tech goods and intellectual property protection during the visit, he predicted.  The Chinese will be happy to buy a lot of American goods. That s what they know Trump wants   big export numbers,  he said, predicting that China would announce big business deals and allow the president to tout them during his visit.

Kremlin hits at Twitter's 'prejudiced' move against two Russian media outlets,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Twitter s ban on adverts from Russian media was motivated by Washington s  deep prejudices  against Moscow and was setting a worrying precedent for the company to treat its clients unequally, the Kremlin said on Friday. Twitter Inc on Thursday accused Russian media outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism in the United States that the social network had not done enough to deter international meddling.  We regret this. We regret that, first and foremost, this company (Twitter) is most probably falling victim to deep prejudices about our mass media,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  We also regret that the company is actually creating a precedent of unequal treatment of its clients which ... is likely to alarm and worry other users of this network.  In April, Reuters reported that RT and Sputnik were part of a plan by Russian President Vladimir Putin to swing the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters  faith in the American electoral system, according to three current and four former U.S. officials. The Kremlin has strongly denied U.S. accusations of  meddling in the polls.  We still hope that in the end the company will deem it necessary to analyze this situation in detail and in the end will come to a conclusion that the work of free mass media, which RT and Sputnik are certainly part of, should in no way be qualified as meddling in the electoral process of the U.S.A. or any other country,  Peskov said. He also said that possible new U.S. sanctions against Russia were a cause for concern and a reflection of Washington s  unfriendly and even hostile attitude towards our country . The U.S. State Department said on Thursday it had belatedly begun informing Congress and others about groups associated with the Russian intelligence and defense sectors as required under a 2017 law tightening sanctions on Russia.

UK PM May concerned by reports of sexual harassment in parliament: spokeswoman,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is concerned by a newspaper report describing a culture of sexual harassment among lawmakers and their staff working in parliament, her spokeswoman said on Friday. The report in the Sun newspaper follows dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein which have prompted hundreds of thousands of women around the world to share their own experiences. The Sun said on Friday that female staff working in London s Westminster political district had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators. It did not name anyone in connection with allegations but cited unnamed members of the group when describing its contents and purpose.    The reports are very concerning, but I can t pre-empt allegations or investigations that haven t come to light yet,  May s spokeswoman said when asked about the Sun story.  The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics.  Separately, a group of women members of Britain s opposition Labour Party have set up a website calling on fellow members who have experienced sexual harassment within party ranks to tell their stories anonymously to try and improve Labour s culture.  Any allegations that may come to light would be taken extremely seriously and we would advise people to contact the police if there is such an allegation,  May s spokeswoman said.

Hot air? U.S. gas exporters rush to sell LNG to China,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. gas exporters and traders are aiming to grab a bigger chunk of the lucrative, growing business of exporting gas to China, the world s third-largest buyer, when they accompany Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to China next month. But the talk may all be hot air if the U.S. suppliers can t compete with bargain prices agreed on long-term deals with rivals Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. According to a list seen by Reuters, 10 of the 29 companies traveling with Ross and U.S President Donald Trump are involved in energy and gas. [L4N1N228C] Among them are Cheniere Energy Inc, which operates the only U.S. LNG export terminal and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra s vaunted commodities division. [L4N1N228C] Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as the U.S. shale revolution threatens to upset the global LNG market. China s appetite has soared as it embarks on an audacious bid to heat millions of homes across the north by gas for the first time this winter and switch tens of thousands of industrial boilers to the cleaner fuel as part of its push to clear the skies.  Without sufficient domestic output to meet growing demand, imports have surged this year, offering huge potential for major exporting nations such as the United States.  We re on the mission to talk to Chinese companies to get something signed up,  said Frederick Jones, founder and chief executive of Delfin Midstream LLC, which is building floating LNG vessels that would sit 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana.  He s heading to Beijing on the trip scheduled to begin on Nov. 8 with his chief financial officer Matthew Weil. Delfin has no customers yet for its new terminal, but hopes to  showcase  the company to state-owned and large private companies. Delfin has been in talks with Chinese buyers for potential offtake deals as well as funds for financing, according to a person with knowledge of the exchanges. A Chinese oil trading executive involved in discussions ahead of the trip expected the delegation to yield several short-term supply deals. (For a graphic on 'LNG market overview' click reut.rs/2z21LDq) In May, the United States and China agreed to boost trade under the  100-day  trade talks aimed at reducing a U.S. trade deficit with China that reached $347 billion last year. Among the agreements is one allowing Chinese buyers to purchase long-term supplies from the United States directly.     Current long-term contracts with Qatar and Australia signed between 2009 and 2013 will expire around 2030/40, but China will need to top up imports to meet growing demand.  Uncertain when the global LNG market will bottom out, Chinese buyers are cautiously avoiding lining up new long-term contracts, but rather are looking at signing five-year or even shorter-term deals based on spot prices, sources said. U.S. imports of LNG have exploded this year.    (For a graphic on 'China LNG Imports by Origin' click reut.rs/2yO1bvM) In the first nine months of the year, shipments hit almost 600,000 tonnes, ranking the United States as the sixth largest LNG importer, leap-frogging Nigeria and Peru.  The average price China paid for U.S. LNG was $7.62 per million of British thermal units (mmBtu) over the past 12 months on a delivered basis, compared to $6.54 for Australia, according to Reuters calculations based on monthly customs data. In 2016, China imported just under 200,000 tonnes of LNG, up from 62,601 tonnes in 2015.  China expects that gas demand will rise to between 320 and 360 billion cubic metres per year by 2020. The increase is the equivalent of the annual consumption of Japan, Asia s second-largest gas consumer after China.

Rights groups urge UK to request Bahrain free activist's relatives,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A group of 13 human rights organizations urged the British government to call for the release of three Bahrainis detained in the Gulf State, saying they were being punished because they were relatives of a London-based activist and his wife. In a letter sent to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the group that includes Amnesty International and UK legal charity Reprieve called for the release of Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, Hajar Mansoor Hasan and Mahmood Marzooq Mansoor. The three are relatives of Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei and his wife Duaa Alwadaei. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei is the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, a Britain-based group campaigning for political change in Bahrain. The three were arrested in March in Bahrain while Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei was attending the 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  We therefore urge your government to request Bahrain to immediately release Mr and Mrs Alwadaei s relatives ahead of their October 30 trial and drop all charges against them,  said the letter sent on Thursday. It called the case  part of a pattern of abuse and harassment against human rights defenders and their families in Bahrain . The letter said the three detainees are facing up to three years in jail.  Bahrain is punishing his innocent family as retribution for his peaceful activism,  said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve. Bahrain s government officials could not be immediately reached for a comment. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei s family members have been under the spotlight of Bahrain s authorities since he took part in protest against the attendance of the Gulf state s king at a royal horse show in Britain. King Hamad attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show last year, and the state-run Bahrain News Agency BNA published his photographs with Britain s Queen Elizabeth II. Bahrain, which has a Shi ite Muslim majority population and is ruled by a Sunni royal family, has seen unrest since the  Arab Spring  protests across the region in 2011.  Many of Bahrain s Shi ites say they suffer discrimination, which the government denies. It accuses Shi ite power Iran of fomenting unrest on its soil, a charged Tehran denies.

Scotland's Sturgeon seeks assurance on Brexit transition,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has sought confirmation from Prime Minister Theresa May that Britain is urgently seeking a transition agreement with the European Union before the end of the year. Sturgeon, who heads the devolved government, said in a letter to May she was  increasingly concerned  that Brexit talks would end in no deal and see Britain crash out, following contradictory indications from UK government officials earlier this week.   The clarity of your intentions, and thus the confidence of business that there will be a sensible transition period agreed quickly, has been seriously undermined,  she wrote.  This relates in particular to your comments suggesting no transition can be agreed, or formalized, until there is agreement on the future relationship (with the EU).  The UK government said on Wednesday it wants an agreement of the outline of transitional arrangements in early 2018, and that it expects such an agreement to be quickly and easily reached. Asked about Sturgeon s letter, a spokesman for May said:  We will respond in due course . Uncertainty around formalizing a transition period ahead of agreement on Britain s future relationship with the EU was causing confusion and damaging business confidence, Sturgeon argued. She said she was seeking confirmation that the prime minister was  urgently seeking agreement on a transition arrangement of at least two years, with the aim of securing that agreement by the end of this year.

Mattis talks diplomacy on North Korea ahead of Trump's Asia tour,"PANMUNJOM, South Korea (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emphasized diplomatic efforts to resolve the North Korean missile and nuclear crisis as he stood at the tense and heavily fortified border between North and South on Friday, saying:  Our goal is not war.  His remarks came before U.S. President Donald Trump - who has threatened to destroy the North if necessary - leaves on his first trip to Asia next week, including a stop in South Korea to meet President Moon Jae-in. For his part, Moon, after talks with Mattis, said the  aggressive deployment  of U.S. strategic assets in the region, which have included overflights by U.S. bombers, had been effective in deterring the North Korean threat. Tension between North Korea and the United States has been building after a series of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang and bellicose verbal exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, stoking fears any miscalculation could lead to an armed confrontation.   North Korean provocations continue to threaten regional and global security despite unanimous condemnation by the United Nations Security Council,  Mattis said in prepared remarks as he visited the demilitarized zone (DMZ).  As Secretary of State Tillerson has made clear, our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.  Standing alongside Mattis, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo said:  We together will continue to defend peace through strong will and strong might.  Ahead of Trump s visit to Asia, Mattis has emphasized diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis during his week-long trip to the region.  That s really what it was all about   to keep the (North Korea) effort firmly in the diplomatic lane for resolution,  Mattis said earlier this week after three days of meetings with Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.  At the same time, the U.S. and South Korean militaries are looking for ways to deter Pyongyang and bolster the South s defenses. Washington s top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with his South Korean counterpart, General Kyeong Doo Jeong, a U.S. military statement said. Dunford renewed U.S. warnings of retaliation to further provocations.   (Dunford) reaffirmed that any attack by North Korea would be met with a response that will be overwhelming and effective, using the full range of U.S. military capabilities,  the statement said. The United States flew Air Force bombers over waters east of North Korea last month in a show of force. The U.S. Navy, in what it says was a long-planned maneuver, will have three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups in the Pacific in the coming days.  Last week, CIA chief Mike Pompeo said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent.  U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to denuclearize. The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities for  flagrant  human rights abuses, including killings, torture, forced labor and the hunting down of asylum seekers abroad. In a speech last month at the United Nations, Trump threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and allies. Kim has blasted Trump as  mentally deranged.  Despite the rhetoric, White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution. But all options, including military ones, are on the table.   Do we have military options in defense for attack, if our allies are attacked? Of course we do. But everyone is out for a peaceful resolution,  Mattis told reporters traveling with him this week.  No one s rushing for war.  Separately, North Korea released a South Korean fishing boat which had been found to be in North Korean waters illegally, state media said. The crew of 10 - seven South Koreans and three Vietnamese - were released on Friday evening, a spokesman for South Korea s coastguard told Reuters. The return of the boat, which had been reported as missing from Saturday, may have eased already strained relations between North and South. The two sides are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and the United States.

"Catalonia casts shadow on positive BBVA, Sabadell results","MADRID (Reuters) - Broadly positive results from BBVA and Sabadell were overshadowed on Friday by growing fears over the impact of Catalonia s bid for independence. The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent. BBVA and Sabadell are among the Spanish banks with the highest exposure to the region, where Madrid was preparing to impose direct rule on Friday Shares in Sabadell were the among the worst performers on Spain s Ibex-35 falling 4.5 percent, while BBVA dropped 1.8 percent as investors focused on events in Catalonia.  We did see some movements of deposits during a few days but really nothing material and things have really normalized but there were some days when clients were nervous about the uncertainty,  BBVA s chief executive officer, Carlos Torres, told analysts Deposits in the northeastern region were safe, although if the situation persists it could cut Spanish growth to less than 2.5 percent in 2018, he later added. Although BBVA is based in the northern city of Bilbao it became one of the biggest lenders in Catalonia after buying two former savings banks in the region, Catalunya Banc and Unnim. In an attempt to calm clients, Sabadell decided in early October to move its legal headquarters out of Catalonia. While an economic recovery and a property rebound has allowed most of Spain s banks to tackle toxic balance sheets faster than peers in Italy, the results from BBVA and Sabadell underlined that pressure on revenue from lending remains. Spanish banks are struggling to lift earnings from loans, as interest rates hover at historic lows and increasing competition erodes margins. BBVA s net interest income (NII), or profit from loans minus funding cost, was down around 2 percent against the previous quarter, while Sabadell s NII fell 4 percent. To offset pressure at home, Spanish banks have been expanding abroad in search of higher revenues. BBVA s net profit was up 19 percent up for the period July to September to 1.14 billion euros, slightly above analysts  forecast in a Reuters poll, boosted by Mexico, which accounts for more than 40 percent of its earnings. Net profit at Sabadell however fell 8 percent in the third quarter to 203 million euros, below analysts  forecasts, after its bottom line was impacted by the sale of some its units.  The lender however stuck to its profit target of 800 million euros for 2017. Friday s results showed BBVA, the country s second biggest bank by assets, reduced its non-performing loans by 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in the quarter, while Sabadell reduced its problematic assets by 500 million euros. Sabadell s chief executive, Jaime Guardiola, said it would also meet its target of reducing problematic assets by 2 billion euros by year-end despite the political uncertainty. The European Central Bank announced this month new guidelines for lenders to reduce bad loans, although the plans are meeting with a fierce backlash in Italy. Italian banks have more than 210 billion in non-performing exposure, while Spanish banks have combined non-performing loans of 106 billion euros..     ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Ireland says Brexit talks can't move on without clarity over border,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Britain s talks on exiting the European Union cannot progress, as London wishes, to trade relations until it give more clarity on what will happen at its border with Ireland, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Friday. The border with Northern Ireland, which will be the UK s only land frontier with the EU after its departure, is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly solved before talks on trade can start in December at the earliest.  On the border issue, I m sorry but we need more clarity than we have right now. We cannot move ahead to phase two on the back of a promise that we don t see any delivery mechanism to make a reality,  Coveney told a conference.  We don t need all the answers but we certainly need to have more assurance than we have today and we need some understanding that if the trade negotiations collapse, which could happen, that the Irish issues will still be resolved and prioritized.  With close trading links to Britain, Ireland is considered the EU member most at risk when its neighbor leaves the bloc. That means it needs to plan  for all eventualities  and is already doing so, Coveney said. Ireland has called for Britain and the EU to reach a bespoke customs union partnership to eliminate the risk of a  hard  border returning between it and Northern Ireland, which until a 1998 peace deal was separated by military checkpoints because of 30 years of sectarian violence in the province. However, Dublin wants Britain to commit to a fallback option, including potential special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid a customs border should Britain s plan of maintaining the closest possible ties with the EU fall through. If those assurances are forthcoming, Dublin will  probably be Britain s closest friend  in the trade talks but if London maintains its current position, some sort of customs border on the island of Ireland cannot be avoided, Coveney said. Ireland s Central Bank has told Irish firms to do more to prepare for an abrupt British departure and speaking at the same conference, Allied Irish Banks  chairman said Ireland must be ready for a  car crash Brexit.   We must plan for the worst possible car-crash Brexit if the ultra-Brexiteers, the head-bangers, are prepared to blow up the British economy in the name of taking back control,  Richard Pym said.

"Russia undermining action against chemical weapons, says UK, citing Syria 'cover up'","LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Friday accused Russia of trying to hide the use of sarin gas by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad s government, and said Moscow s behavior was undermining the consensus against chemical weapons. A United Nations report released on Thursday found Assad s government to blame for a chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria which killed dozens of people in April and prompted a retaliatory U.S. missile strike. Commenting on the release of that report, Johnson called on the international community to hold Assad s government to account.  He also launched a fierce attack on Russia, which helped broker a deal in 2013 under which Assad agreed to destroy Syria s chemical weapon stockpile.   Russia has repeatedly attempted to disrupt efforts to get to the truth of the Khan Sheikhoun attack,  he said in a statement.  Russia has consistently chosen to cover up for Assad.   This behavior can only undermine the global consensus against the use of chemical weapons. I call on Russia to stop covering up for its abhorrent ally and keep its own commitment to ensure that chemical weapons are never used again.  Russia has defended the Syrian leader against U.S. allegations that his forces carried out the attack, saying there was no evidence. Russia said the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not Assad s government.  The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the country s more than six-year civil war. Moscow backs Syrian government forces against rebels in the war. The chemical weapons investigation mechanism was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which includes Russia, in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November, and Russia on Tuesday vetoed a proposal to further extend its mandate.  Russian ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia said Russia would consider revisiting the mandate extension after Thursday s report was discussed. Johnson s comments come only weeks after his foreign ministry announced he would travel to Moscow later this year to discuss international security issues.  Johnson has previously described diplomatic relations with Russia as  difficult  but said the British government had a policy of engaging with Moscow  to further mutual interests where they exist . In April, following the sarin gas attack, he canceled what would have been the first visit to Russia in five years by a British foreign secretary.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
"As Mattis peers into North Korea, he gets warning on artillery","DEMILITARIZED ZONE, South Korea (Reuters) - As U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis peered into North Korea from a lookout post on Friday, he was given a blunt reminder by his South Korean counterpart of the vast amount of North Korean artillery within range of Seoul.  Above the faint sound of North Korean propaganda music being blasted from across the border, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo suggested that U.S. and South Korean missile defences simply could not stop all of them.  Defending against this many LRAs (long-range artillery) is infeasible in my opinion,  Song told Mattis, citing a need for strategies to  offensively neutralise  the artillery in the event of a conflict. Mattis replied:  Understood.  The brief exchange at the inter-Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - where U.S .President Donald Trump may visit in coming days - spoke volumes about the risks of any miscalculation as tension soars over Pyongyang s rapidly advancing nuclear weapon and missile programs. Last week, CIA chief Mike Pompeo said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent. U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been sceptical about diplomatic efforts, focussing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to willingly denuclearise. But, as the DMZ trip highlighted, North Korea s conventional weaponry poses such a risk to South Korea that any attempt to denuclearize the North by force could easily escalate into a devastating conflict. Mattis was keen to emphasise efforts to peacefully resolve the crisis, including at the DMZ, as he addressed reporters with his back to the dividing line between North and South.   Our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,  Mattis said, as North Korean soldiers kept watch. Mattis said he and Song also made clear their mutual commitment  to a diplomatic solution to address North Korea s reckless, outlaw behaviour,  when they met this week at a gathering of Asian defence chiefs in the Philippines. He carried that same message after his helicopter flight back to Seoul, where he addressed a small group of U.S. and South Korean soldiers.  It comes down to you to make it work, my fine young troops ... and we ll buy time for our diplomats to solve this problem,  he said. The emphasis on diplomacy came before Trump departs next week on a trip to Asia. He has declined to say whether he will visit the DMZ when he stops in South Korea, telling reporters on Wednesday:  You ll be surprised.  Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and its allies. Kim has blasted Trump as  mentally deranged.  The bellicose verbal exchanges have stoked fears of a military confrontation, but White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution. At the same time, the U.S. and South Korean militaries are looking for ways to deter Pyongyang, and bolster its defences. As Mattis at one point met some of the roughly 28,000 American forces stationed in South Korea, he said the role of U.S. and South Korean troops was essential.  We re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically, everything we can. But ultimately our diplomats have to be backed up by strong soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, so they speak from a position of strength,  he said.  So thanks for standing watch, for holding the line.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1

Suez says temporarily moves Catalonia office to Madrid,"PARIS (Reuters) - France s Suez, the top water provider in Spain, has temporarily moved the legal registration of its offices in Catalonia to Madrid because of legal uncertainty related to Catalonia s independence movement.  Suez sells water to municipal and industrial customers in Spain where last year it generated 2.5 billion euros of its 15.3 billion euro total revenue.   We have temporarily moved the registered office of Agbar, which is the (Suez) holding company in Catalonia, to Madrid in order to protect the legal certainty of investors, because what we see now in Catalonia is uncertainty,  Chief Financial Officer Christophe Cros said on an earnings call. He said that in 2015 Suez had already moved the legal address of the holding company owning all its activities in Spain from Barcelona to Madrid.  This was not because of politics but because the company wanted to establish a stronger presence in Madrid, as Catalonia makes up only about 50 percent of Suez  revenue in Spain.  Cros said business in Spain in general as well as in Catalonia had been good in the first nine months of the year.  Our business in Catalonia is to deliver water to consumers and I don t expect any change in the need in water,  he said.  In 2015, when Suez finalised its full takeover of Aguas de Barcelona (Agbar), former Agbar minority shareholder Criteria Caixa became Suez  second-largest shareholder and now holds 5.74 percent of its shares. Suez  Spanish water unit Agbar - whose roots go back to 1882 - has over 12,600 staff worldwide and generated 60 percent of its revenue in Spain, the rest mainly in Chile.

Britain believes North Korea was behind 'WannaCry' NHS cyber attack," LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Friday it believed North Korea was behind the  WannaCry  cyber attack in May that disrupted businesses and government services worldwide, including the National Health Service (NHS) in England.  Security Minister Ben Wallace said Britain believed  quite strongly  that the ransomware attack came from a foreign state.  ""North Korea was the state that we believe was involved in this worldwide attack on our systems,"" he told BBC radio.   We can be as sure as possible - I can t obviously go into the detailed intelligence but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role.   WannaCry infected more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries in a matter of days, demanding victims pay ransoms starting at $300 to regain access to their machines.  Cyber security researchers quickly identified a possible link to North Korea.  More than a third of England s 236 NHS trusts and an estimated 19,000 appointments were affected, Britain s National Audit Office said on Friday in a report on the attack.  It said WannaCry was a relatively unsophisticated attack that could have been prevented by the NHS had it followed basic IT security best practice.  No NHS organization paid the ransom but the government does not know how much the disruption to services cost the NHS, it said.  Wallace said Britain needed to redouble its efforts to strengthen cyber security.   It s a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large organizations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks,  he said.

Alphabet soup as Kazakh leader orders switch to Latin letters,"ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakhstan is to change its official alphabet for the third time in less than 100 years in what is seen in part as symbolic move to underline its independence. President Nursultan Nazarbayev ordered his office on Thursday to prepare for a switch to a Latin-based alphabet from a Cyrillic one, distancing itself, at least graphically, from Russia. The oil-rich former Soviet republic of 18 million has very close ties with Moscow, its main trading partner, but is also wary of Russia s ambitions to maintain its political influence throughout the region. Kazakh, a Turkic language, used to be written in Arabic script until the 1920s when the Soviet Union briefly introduced a Latin alphabet for it. This was later replaced by a Cyrillic one in 1940, based on the Russian alphabet. Part of the latest switch relates to modern technology. The currently used Cyrillic alphabet has 42 symbols, making it cumbersome to use with digital devices - a standard Kazakh keyboard utilizes almost all number keys in addition to letter and punctuation keys. The latest version of the proposed Latin alphabet works around that by using apostrophe signs to modify letters. The country s official name would thus be spelled as Qazaqstan Respy blikasy. According to a statement published by Nazarbayev s office, he has ordered his chief of staff to draft an executive order introducing the new alphabet. The switch will be gradual, it said. Alhough Kazakh has been the state language since Kazakhstan became independent in 1991, only 62 percent of the population said they were fluent in both written and spoken Kazakh during a the most recent national census in 2009. Russian is more widespread with 85 percent claiming fluency in the same census. Russian is recognized as an official language in Kazakhstan. Several other Turkic nations, including Turkey itself, ex-Soviet Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, have also switched to Latin alphabets. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"Australian court rules deputy PM ineligible for parliament, government loses majority","CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia s High Court ruled on Friday that Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is ineligible to remain in parliament, a stunning decision that cost the government its one-seat parliamentary majority and forced a by-election. The Australian dollar fell a quarter of a U.S. cent after the unexpected decision. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he accepted the court s ruling, even though it was  clearly not the outcome we were hoping for . Turnbull did not name a new deputy leader during a short news conference in Canberra soon after the court s ruling. The Australian leader had been scheduled to travel to Israel on Saturday for a week-long visit but a spokesman for Turnbull told Reuters his departure has now been delayed. The spokesman said the new travel arrangements are still be finalised. Turnbull s center-right coalition is now in a precarious position. His Liberal Party is the senior party in a coalition with the smaller National Party, which Joyce led. He must now win the support of one of three independent lawmakers to keep his minority government afloat, with two sitting weeks of parliament left until it recesses for the year. At least two independent lawmakers have promised their support. Independent MP Bob Katter told Reuters he would support the government, but he may reconsider that if the coalition tried to block renewed efforts for a sweeping investigation into the scandal-ridden financial system.  I think we have the numbers for a commission into the banks and, if the government tries to block that, then I think we will get into murky waters,  Katter said. The opposition Labor Party immediately went on the attack and threatened to launch a legal challenge to every decision made by Joyce since last year s election. Joyce was one of a group of lawmakers, known as the  Citizenship Seven , whose eligibility to sit in parliament was thrown into doubt in recent months when it was found they were dual citizens, a status that is barred for politicians under Australia s constitution to prevent split allegiances. Turnbull is under added pressure because he refused to force Joyce to step aside while his case was considered by the High Court. Joyce, whose New England electorate is in rural New South Wales state, renounced his dual New Zealand citizenship in August.  ... the business of government goes on,  Turnbull said as he confirmed that the New England by-election would be held on Dec. 2. Joyce confirmed he would stand in the by-election, which polling shows he has a strong chance of winning.   It is a tough game, politics,  Joyce told reporters in the rural town of Tamworth in his electorate.  You take the hits and the sacrifices.  Acting Labor leader Tanya Plibersek said Turnbull had shown  reckless judgment  in keeping Joyce on the front bench during the court challenge.  We are deeply concerned that Australia is facing a period of uncertainty because this prime minister has insisted on keeping ministers on his front bench who have been not only ineligible to be ministers but ineligible to be in the parliament,  Plibersek said. The Australian dollar fell as low as $0.7623 after the ruling to a level not seen since July 11. It pared some of those losses to last trade at $0.7639 as investors considered Joyce s chances of re-election.  It could dent business sentiment, which has been holding up pretty well,  said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital.  Should that take a dent, investment and employment could be impacted,  he said. All seven lawmakers accepted that they were dual nationals at the time of their election but claimed they were unaware of their status. Some were conferred a second nationality by birth, others by descent.  Of the remaining six, who were from the coalition and minority parties, four were also found ineligible to hold parliamentary office. Some had already resigned. All were senators, which meant seats in the upper house of parliament could be assigned to party alternatives if they were ruled ineligible, rather than hold more by-elections. Australian Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue had urged the seven justices of the High Court not to interpret the constitution literally. He argued that five of the seven, including three Cabinet members, should be cleared because they were unaware that they had contravened the constitutional requirement at the time.

"U.N. rights chief decries hunger in Syrian siege, demands aid access","GENEVA (Reuters) - The humanitarian situation in the besieged eastern suburbs of Damascus is  an outrage  and parties to the conflict must allow food and medicine to reach at least 350,000 trapped Syrians, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein said on Friday.  The shocking images of what appear to be severely malnourished children that have emerged in recent days are a frightening indication of the plight of people in Eastern Ghouta, who are now facing a humanitarian emergency,  Zeid said in a statement. The tightening siege has pushed people to the verge of famine in the rebel enclave, residents and aid workers have told Reuters.  I remind all parties that the deliberate starvation of civilians as a method of warfare constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law, and may amount to a crime against humanity and/or a war crime,  Zeid said. Zeid s office had a list of several hundred people who needed medical evacuation, but the government had reportedly imposed severe restrictions on such evacuations, leading to the deaths of several civilians, the U.N. statement said.  A U.N. convoy last reached the besieged area on Sept 23, with aid for 25,000 people. Food prices have rocketed since forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad took control of several neighborhoods in May and destroyed tunnels that had been used to smuggle goods into the siege. This month they closed Eastern Ghouta s main access checkpoint and imposed a big rise in taxes imposed on traders. Last week two food warehouses were looted in  a possible sign of growing desperation , the U.N. statement said. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
"Twitter bans ads from two Russian media outlets, cites election meddling","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Thursday accused Russian media outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism the social network had not done enough to deter international meddling.  RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending with its sales tactics, while Russia s foreign ministry said the ban was due to U.S. government pressure and that it planned to retaliate.  San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is  not something we want  on the social network. It cited a report this year from U.S. intelligence agencies and said it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.  We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,  the company said. Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc s Google have all recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election. Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money  to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.  The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules. RT, an English-language news channel, accused Twitter s sales staff of pressuring it to spend big on advertising in 2016 ahead of the election.   The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,  RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch. It said it never  pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.  Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. A former Twitter employee said the sales pitch to RT is similar to what the company uses to lure advertisers to Twitter, which has struggled to turn a profit.  On Thursday, Twitter said it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies, which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending. In April, Reuters reported that RT and Sputnik were part of a plan by Russian President Vladimir Putin to swing the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters  faith in the American electoral system, according to three current and four former U.S. officials. On Oct. 19, U.S. lawmakers, alarmed that foreign entities used the internet to influence last year s election, introduced legislation to extend rules governing political advertising on broadcast television, radio and satellite to also cover social media. General counsels for Twitter, Facebook and Google will testify on Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.   Twitter is wisely positioning itself to be able to tell the committees that the company has taken steps to address the issues raised,  Adam Sharp, a former Twitter executive, told Reuters on Thursday. The Russian foreign ministry said the ban was a  gross violation  by the United States of the guarantees of free speech.   Retaliatory measures, naturally, will follow,  ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to the RIA news agency. Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter s move was regrettable,  especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.   Some analysts said transparency, rather than a ban, would have been a better approach. Unlike Facebook, Twitter allows anonymous accounts and automated accounts, or bots, making the service more difficult to police.   Banning any particular person, group or country is just bad policy - in other parts of the world, platforms will come to be viewed as a tool of U.S. or other foreign policy and it will give authoritarian regimes more excuses to ban speech,  Albert Gidari, who as a lawyer has represented tech companies, said in an email. Gidari is now privacy director at Stanford Law School s Center for Internet and Society.  A U.S. lawmaker, Representative Adam Schiff, applauded Twitter s move.   Serving as a platform for free expression does not require assisting foreign powers in their efforts to push propaganda, whether by promoted tweets or other means,  Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.

Angola's new president takes surprise steps to rein in dos Santos,"LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola s new President Jo o Louren o is making swift moves to wrest power from his predecessor Jose Eduardo dos Santos, pushing out some of his key allies and vowing to combat monopolies controlled by a family that has run Angola for four decades. Dos Santos, 75, handpicked Louren o, 63, to succeed him when he stepped down last month after 38 years in power, prompting critics to suggest the little-known newcomer would be a puppet of the dominant dos Santos family. But analysts, diplomats and politicians have been surprised by the speed at which Louren o has tried to take on some of the entrenched vested interests that control sub-Saharan Africa s third largest economy and second biggest oil exporter. Heavyweights from the previous administration, such as Vice President Manuel Vicente and Minister of State Manuel  Kopelipa  H lder Vieira Dias Jr, have found themselves out of a job. Dos Santos still retains significant power as the head of the ruling MPLA party, and key posts such as the finance minister and central bank governor have not yet been touched. But in the vital oil sector, responsible for 75 percent of government revenue, Louren o curbed the control of dos Santos  daughter, Isabel, who runs national oil company Sonangol. This month Louren o appointed Carlos Saturnino, who was sacked by Isabel dos Santos last year, as Secretary of State for Oil, a technically more senior role than that of his old boss.   It was unexpected at this early stage,  said Marcolino Moco, a former Angolan prime minister and critic of Jose Eduardo dos Santos.   It s very early still, but Louren o is sending a sign that the excesses of the dos Santos era will not continue.  Isabel dos Santos, Africa s richest woman, denied any tension with Louren o, telling Reuters last week that their views were in  full alignment . In his state of the nation address on October 16, Louren o vowed to break up monopolies in the economy, directly mentioning the cement industry in which Isabel and her husband have large holdings. He also abolished government communications department GRECIMA, with which a company co-owned by another dos Santos daughter, Welwitschia, had lucrative contracts. The company, Semba Comunica o, could not be reached for comment.  Breaking the monopolies enjoyed by the dos Santos family would be going for the jugular,  said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, an author and expert on Angola who teaches at Oxford University.   But there is a danger of confusing a vendetta against dos Santos with a true reform agenda,  Oliveira said. Major reform is desperately needed. Although an oil boom has made Angola one of Africa s richest countries per capita, it is also one of the world s most unequal, with the vast majority of the population sharing little of its wealth. Angola s economy fell into recession last year and unemployment is at least 25 percent. A lack of foreign currency has forced companies, such as airlines and oil services, to pull back operations. A dollar fetches three times the official rate on the black market. Ratings agency Moody s downgraded Angola s credit rating last week, saying the economy remained constrained by foreign currency shortages, high inflation, low public spending and a weak banking system. There are early indications Louren o may be placing capable technocrats into roles to fix some of these problems. Ricardo Viegas de Abreu, a banking executive and former deputy governor of the central bank, was appointed last week Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs.  Jos  Massano, a former central bank governor popular with international investors, could return to his old job, local media reported Wednesday. A spokesperson for the central bank declined to comment. For Louren o s opponents the jury is still out.  We re still in the phase of promises  action hasn t brought us anything yet,  Adalberto Costa J nior, parliamentary head of main opposition party Unita, told Reuters.

U.S sanctions North Koreans for 'flagrant' rights abuse,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities for  flagrant  human rights abuses, including killings, torture, forced labor and the hunting down of asylum seekers abroad.  Today s sanctions target the North Korean military and regime officials,  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.  We also are targeting North Korean financial facilitators who attempt to keep the regime afloat with foreign currency earned through forced labor operations.  Among those sanctioned were the director and the deputy director of the Military Security Command, the first vice minister of the Ministry of People s Security and the labor minister. North Korea s consul general in Shenyang, China, and a diplomat at its embassy in Vietnam were also sanctioned.  We are especially concerned with the North Korean military, which operates as secret police, punishing all forms of dissent,  the statement said.  Further, the military operates outside of North Korea to hunt down asylum seekers, and brutally detains and forcibly returns North Korean citizens.  The Treasury statement charged that Ku Sung Sop, the consul general in Shenyang, and Kim Min Chol, the diplomat in Vietnam, had participated in the forced repatriation of North Korean asylum seekers.  Scott Busby, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, told a news briefing that Ku s case had been raised with China. He said it was up to China how to react, but the range of possibilities included expelling him from the country. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China does not approve of countries using their own domestic law to enact unilateral sanctions outside of the United Nations framework.  We will maintain normal exchanges and cooperation with North Korea on the basis of complying with U.N. resolutions,  he told a daily news briefing, without elaborating. Busby said North Korean government violations included extrajudicial killings, torture, rape and forced abortions and the aim of the sanctions was to send a message, especially to prison camp managers and mid-level officials, that individuals would be held accountable. The U.S. administration has sought to restrict the income North Korea receives from its export of labor as part of efforts to choke off funds helping to finance the country s nuclear and missile programs, which Pyongyang says are aimed at developing weapons capable of hitting the United States. North Korea routinely denies widespread allegations of rights abuses. The Treasury statement said the Ch olhyo n Overseas Construction Company, which was sanctioned along with the Military Security Command and the External Construction Bureau, had operated in Algeria and was reported to earn foreign currency for North Korea.  Employees of Ch olhyo n are kept in slave-like conditions, including having salaries and passports withheld by (North Korean) security officials assigned as site supervisors, meager food rations, poor living conditions, and severe restrictions on their freedom of movement,  the Treasury statement said. It said the External Construction Bureau had operated in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
North Korea to release captured South Korea fishing boat Friday: KCNA,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said it will release a South Korean fishing vessel on Friday for humanitarian reasons after the boat was found  illegally  in waters under the North s control six days ago, North Korean state news agency KCNA said. The boat and its crew had been captured on Oct. 21 and they will be released  at the designated waters of the military boundary line in the East Sea (38 39 20  latitude, 128 38 10 longitude) at 1800 on Oct. 27,  the news agency report said.  North Korea had reached its decision to release the South Korean boat after  taking into account the fact that all the crewmen honestly admitted their offence, repeatedly apologizing and asking for leniency,  the report said in English. An investigation by the North had  proved  the boat and crew had entered North Korean waters for fishing. North Korean fishing boats, because of age or low fuel, have been found drifting south of the maritime border between the two Koreas at times. Most North Korean crew are released to the North after interrogations by intelligence officials if they wish to return. It is more unusual for South Korean fishing vessels to be found under similar circumstances. The South Korean government could not be immediately reached for comment.

"Imran Khan's PTI retains seat in by-election, but new religious parties gain","PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan s opposition Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former cricket hero Imran Khan, swept to a comfortable by-election victory on the edge of the northwestern city of Peshawar, though its majority was trimmed by new hardline religious parties. PTI candidate Arbab Amir Ayub clinched 45,631 votes, about 34.8 percent of the total, on Thursday to ensure PTI kept the parliamentary seat in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) that it governs.  The by-election was seen as a litmus test of PTI s popularity in KP, where it has focused on police, health and education reforms in contrast to the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party betting on road and energy infrastructure projects. Khan, the PTI chairman, touted the victory as a  direct vote of confidence  in his party s performance governing KP since the 2013 election, when it won the National Assembly seat, known as Peshawar NA-4, with a majority of about 40 percent. The next general election is due in mid-2018 but Khan has called for early polls after PML-N leader and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was toppled in July by a Supreme Court disqualification over an undeclared source of income. Analysts say Khan s chances of becoming prime minister have been boosted by Sharif s ouster, and the sportsman has doubled down on his populist message by saying he will pull the country away from infrastructure spending towards improving schools, hospitals and the lives of the poor.  Most of the youngsters like Imran Khan and believe he can steer the country out of crisis and stop corruption,  said Zahid Hussain, a government contractor.    Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Khushdil Khan secured 24,830 votes, or 18.9 percent of the total, to pip PML-N s Nasir Khan Musazai, who won 23,169 votes to finish third. Khushdil Khan s showing will hearten the ANP, whose candidates barely campaigned in 2013 as the Pakistani Taliban targeted and killed many of its leaders and activists in KP. But it was the performance of two new hardline religious parties that caught the eye of political observers.  Muhammad Shafiq Ameeni, a candidate for the Tehreek-i-Labaik party, won 7.6 percent of the ballot campaigning on a platform of support for Pakistan s strict blasphemy laws that are already some of the world s harshest. Labaik supporters have spread their hardline message, including the notion that those who commit blasphemy against Islam should be killed, through mosques and seminaries. Syed Moharram Shah, a Labaik activist, said the party was surprised it captured 9,060 votes because it wasn t fully prepared for the election.  This is our first attempt but look at people s response. It s very much encouraging,  he said. Alhaj Liaqat Ali Khan, an independent candidate backed by the Milli Muslim League (MML) party, loyal to Hafiz Saeed, an Islamist under house arrest, obtained 3,557 votes. Washington accuses Saeed of being the mastermind behind the 2008 attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people, and has placed a $10 million bounty on his head. Saeed denies the charge. Last month, candidates backed by Labaik and MML won about 11 percent of the ballot in a by-election for Sharif s vacated seat in a by-election in the eastern city of Lahore.

Cambodian PM says sanctions wouldn't hurt him,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen told his cabinet on Friday he had no fear of Western sanctions after some U.S. senators threatened to push for travel restrictions over his arrest of the main opposition leader, the government spokesman said. Hun Sen s critics accuse him of destroying democracy in Cambodia to ensure that he wins re-election next year to extend more than 32 years in power. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz said he would push for a travel ban on top officials if opposition leader Kem Sokha is not freed by Nov. 9. Senators John McCain and Dick Durbin have also called for travel restrictions if the crackdown continues. Hun Sen told a weekly cabinet meeting that sanctions by Western donors don t worry him, the government spokesman said.  Samdech said he doesn t have wealth abroad and there is no necessity for him to step on U.S. soil,  Phay Siphan told Reuters, using Hun Sen s official title.  Kem Sokha was arrested on Sept. 3 and charged with treason. He is accused of plotting to take power with the help of unspecified Americans - an accusation he denies. The government has also asked the courts to dissolve Kem Sokha s Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) and Hun Sen has called on its members of parliament and other elected officials to defect to his Cambodian People s Party (CPP). Pro-government media said one parliamentarian and some local councillors had defected. Kem Sokha s daughter Monovithya Kem said that if he were not released and the pressure ended on the CNRP, it would mean that next year s election would lack legitimacy.  Hun Sen s government cannot survive without that legitimacy,  she told Reuters.  Cambodia would become a pariah state if the government doesn t reverse course soon.  Western countries have called for the release of Kem Sokha and have intensified lobbying. In an unusually direct statement from Japan, visiting vice minister for foreign affairs Iwao Horii called on Thursday for a free and fair election next year. Japan is Cambodia s biggest aid donor after China.  He expressed the expectation that Cambodia s next national election will be conducted in a free and fair manner,  Hironori Suzuki, Counsellor at the Japanese Embassy, said in an email to Reuters.  He expected that the general election would be held in a way that the international community will welcome.  Hun Sen has been increasingly isolated from Western donor pressure by his strong relationship with China, which has become by far the biggest giver of foreign aid as well as the biggest investor in Cambodia.

"Japanese girl says school forced her to dye hair black, sues government: media","TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese teenager is suing the government of Osaka, saying her public high school repeatedly forced her to dye her naturally-brown hair black or be banned from attending school, local media reported on Friday. In a lawsuit filed in Osaka District Court, the 18-year-old girl said her mother informed Kaifukan School in Habikino city upon her enrolment that she was born with brownish hair, as the school had a policy banning hair coloring, media reported. Educators, however, instructed her to color her hair black, telling her repeatedly that the dye job was insufficient and forcing her to  either dye the hair black or quit school , Kyodo news reported, citing the lawsuit. The girl has not attended school since September 2016, suffered pain and irritation from the hair dye, and is seeking damages of about 2.2 million yen ($19,300), said media, adding that Osaka prefecture is asking the court to reject the claim. Masahiko Takahashi, head of Kaifukan School, said he could not comment directly on the case, but noted the school s policy prohibiting students from dyeing or bleaching hair. He declined to say whether it was permissible to dye brown hair to black. The girl could not be reached for comment. In Japan, where conformity is the cultural norm, many schools have strict rules about hair color, accessories, make-up and uniforms, including the length of skirts for girls.

Late Thai king's remains returned to palace after night of tears,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - The ashes and bones of Thailand s King Bhumibol Adulyadej were returned to the palace on Friday as part of an elaborate, five-day cremation ceremony that drew hundreds of thousands of black-clad mourners to Bangkok s historic old quarter. King Bhumibol was the world s longest-reigning monarch when he died a year ago aged 88. His seven-decade rule spanned some of the most tumultuous moments in modern Thai history, including several coups, a deadly crackdown on student protesters, natural disasters and a regional financial crisis. His son, new King Maha Vajiralongkorn, presided over the burning of his father s remains in a golden crematorium at a late-night ceremony in the Thai capital on Thursday. Many mourners stayed to watch as smoke rose from the crematorium. Some broke down in tears. The crowds had diminished on Friday, but thousands of people still lined the streets to glimpse what they could of a ceremony that in total cost $90 million.  I can t express my sadness at the loss. It s like a child longing for a parent,  said Boonpherm Buatho, 56, a housekeeper. Shielded from the sun by a large white-and-gold umbrella, King Vajiralongkorn led a religious ceremony to return his father s remains to the palace. He sprinkled the bones with sacred water as classical Thai music played. The remains were blessed by Thailand s Supreme Patriarch, the head of the order of Buddhist monks. The late king s bones will be taken to the Grand Palace, where he had lain in state since his death last October. Although Thailand does not conduct polls on the monarchy s popularity - partly because of strict laws that protect the royal family from insult - the king built up a wide personal following and is often referred to as  father . The ceremony on Thursday brought Thailand to a standstill as many businesses, including banks, shut to honor the late king. The late king s nine-spired crematorium, built to honor the ninth king of the Chakri Dynasty, features intricate carvings and staircases with sculptures of nagas - a half-human, half- cobra beings - among other mythical creatures. Pictures of mourners wearing black and holding photographs of the late king flooded social media in Thailand, with many using popular hashtags such as #rama9, #kingofkings, and #thegreatestking. On Saturday, a religious ceremony for the late king s remains will take place within the palace. On Sunday, the bones will be transferred to the palace hall where the relics of past kings are kept. A procession will then take his ashes from the palace to be divided between the temples of Wat Rajabopidh and Wat Bovoranives. The first of those temples contains the ashes of many royals. The second is where King Bhumibol was ordained as a monk - a tradition for many Thai men - and is the center of the strict Thammayut sect founded by the late king s great grandfather.

Philippine mobile phone trader 'collected funds' for Marawi attackers,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine security forces have arrested a mobile phone trader suspected of collecting funds to help finance pro-Islamic State militants who took over a southern city for five months, police said on Friday. Rasdi Malawani, 42, was paraded in front of the press a day after security forces raided his home in Manila s northern suburbs, where a rocket-propelled grenade and a pistol were seized, Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde said. Malawani was not allowed to speak to reporters and no defense lawyer was present. The military on Monday declared victory over the Maute group, which seized control in Marawi City on May 23, after killing the last 40 remaining militants. More than 1,100 people, including 165 soldiers, were killed in the conflict.  Malawani is the brother-in-law of Maddie Maute, one of the Maute brothers who planned and carried out the Marawi attacks, according to police. They said he had given about 300,000 pesos ($5,800) a month for four months to his sister, Lily. The funds were collected from dozens of tenants of Salaam Bazaar, a mobile phone, accessories and electronic market owned by Farhana Maute, the jailed family matriarch, in a shopping mall in Quezon City, police said. Malawani had been running the business for her.  He is facilitating terrorist financing,  Albayalde said.  He is based here in Manila and is not involved in the fighting. He is considered a supporter and sympathizer.  President Rodrigo Duterte, in a speech before an association of professionals late on Thursday, warned of possible retaliation from militants after the military s victory in Marawi.  Retaliation and vengeance are not far-fetched,  Duterte said.  May I just remind you to be vigilant and always be aware that extremism is the problem of the planet today.  Philippine military chief General Eduardo Ano said on Monday Islamist militants who attacked Marawi on May 23 had received some $1.5 million from Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in January.

Airlines get ready for new U.S. security rules from Thursday," (This October 25 story has been refiled to clarify that IATA CEO remarks referred to March rules) By David Shepardson and Jamie Freed WASHINGTON/TAIPEI (Reuters) - New security measures including stricter passenger screening take effect on Thursday on all U.S.-bound flights to comply with government requirements aimed at responding to threats of hidden explosives, airlines said. Airlines contacted by Reuters said the new measures could include short security interviews with passengers at check-in or the boarding gate, sparking concerns over flight delays and extended processing time. They will affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,100 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries. U.S. Transportation Security Administration officials are giving some airlines or airports additional time to comply with the new interviews as long the U.S. government has approved security plans by Thursday.  TSA will continue to work closely with our aviation partners and verify that all security enhancements are accurately implemented,  TSA spokeswoman Lucy Martinez said in a statement Wednesday. The United States announced the new rules in June to end its restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes coming from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africa in response to concerns that explosives could be hidden in electronic devices. Those restrictions were lifted in July, but the Trump administration said it could reimpose measures on a case by case basis if airlines and airports did not boost security.   European and U.S. officials said at the time that airlines had 120 days to comply with the measures, including increased passenger screening. The 120-day deadline is Thursday. Airlines had until late July to expand explosive trace detection testing.  We see this as a big issue for China Airlines,  Steve Chang, senior vice president of the Taiwanese firm told reporters on Wednesday, adding the airline was trying to consult with the American Institute in the country over the issue.  Korean Airlines, South Korea s flagship carrier, also said it had a lot of concerns with the new measures.   We are asking customers to show up at the airport early ... It s just inconvenient for the passengers,  President and Chief Operating Officer Walter Cho told Reuters in Taipei. Lufthansa Group said on Tuesday the measures would be in place by Thursday and travelers could face short interviews at check-in or at the gate.  Economy passengers on Lufthansa s Swiss airline have been asked to check in at least 90 minutes before departure.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it would suspend in-town check-in and self bag-drop services for passengers booked on direct flights to the United States. The airline said passengers would also have short security interviews and it has advised travelers to arrive three hours before departure. Singapore Airlines Ltd said the security checks could include inspections of personal electronic devices as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding. Airlines for America, a U.S. trade group, said the changes   are complex security measures  but praised U.S. officials for giving airlines flexibility in meeting the new rules. Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said the industry understood security threats to aviation were made regularly but in this case the U.S. government had not shared any specific dangers before announcing the initial Middle East and North Africa electronic device restrictions in March.  What we have seen is very strange,  he told reporters in Taipei.  Unilateral measures announced without any prior consultation... That is something that is very concerning and disturbing.   Airlines were however consulted after the March changes. At their annual meeting in Taipei, Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) members passed a resolution calling for security measures to be risk-based, outcome-focused and proportionate to the probable threat.   Unilateral actions taken by individual governments reacting to emerging threats may result in unnecessary disruption or lead to unintended safety consequences,  said the members. AAPA includes most large Asian airlines but not mainland Chinese carriers.  The risk is other countries make similar demands,  AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman said. U.S. authorities in June also ordered increased security around aircraft and in passenger areas, and other places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart and ordered enhanced screening of personal electronic devices. Some of those new requirements take effect this week as well. The TSA said in July it was imposing new security rules requiring U.S. domestic airline travelers to remove all electronic items larger than mobile phones such as tablets, e-readers and video game consoles from carry-on baggage for screening.

'Like a roar': Dozens killed in blasts at Indonesia fireworks plant,"KOSAMBI, Indonesia (Reuters) - Two explosions tore through a fireworks factory on the outskirts of Indonesia s capital on Thursday, killing at least 47 people and injuring dozens. It was one of Indonesia s worst industrial disasters and is likely to cast a new spotlight on lax safety standards in the Southeast Asian country, where rules are often ignored or weakly enforced. Workers had no time to escape from the plant in Tangerang, an industrial and manufacturing hub to the west of Jakarta, after the explosions that one neighbor described as a  roar  that could be heard miles away. A video of the scene inside the warehouse, widely shared on social media, showed charred bodies sprawled about the burnt-out factory, and Reuters reporters at the scene saw grass scorched over an area about 10 meters (33 feet) from the site.  People were burned so badly you couldn t see their faces ... It was really bad,  said search and rescue official Deden Nurjaman, who expected the death toll to climb as more bodies were found inside the factory. Fireworks are frequently used in Indonesia for religious and other celebrations, and are widely available. There have been a series of major fires in Indonesia this year, including one that engulfed one of Jakarta s main markets. Thick, dark plumes of smoke billowed from the factory through the afternoon as an inferno took hold. As night fell, the PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses warehouse was still smoldering and there was a stench of chemicals and burning plastic. Jakarta police spokesman Argo Yuwono told Metro Television that 47 bodies had been discovered, 46 people were injured and 10 people were unaccounted for. He said the missing might have left with light injuries or not have been working at the time. One of the first policemen on the scene, Raymond Masengi, told Metro TV that he and other officers had to smash holes in the factory wall to help the injured escape. Fiza, a doctor in the emergency unit at Tangerang General Hospital, said he was treating seven people, some of them with burns to more than 80 percent of their bodies. Three were in critical condition. A nearby mosque held prayers for the victims. Forensic police worked in fading light to examine the debris, setting up a few floodlights to try and establish the cause of the blaze.  Yuwono said police were looking into the permit of the factory, which was close to a school and housing and - according to media reports - had been operating for only two months.     A witness who lives around the corner from the factory said she heard an explosion  like a roar .  I dressed and stepped outside the house, and saw the flames, they were almost in my face. The smoke, the heat was in my face. I panicked, I was scared, I picked up my son and ran away from the fire,  said Kartini, 40, who uses one name, like many Indonesians. Hundreds of children at a school just 100 meters (yards) from the factory jumped in terror over a wall as the explosions boomed, dropping books and bags in their haste to get away.  Science teacher Asep Mahmud, 47, said:  There were several small explosions and then one really big one that shook our buildings and desks.

Mexican prosecutor says he was unjustly fired as graft dispute brews," (This version of the Oct. 25  story corrects story to change name to Emilio Lozoya in paragraph three) MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A prosecutor who led an investigation into a graft scandal involving the campaign of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Wednesday he was fired without justification, as the Senate prepares to vote on whether to reinstate him. Mexico s acting attorney general fired Santiago Nieto, the attorney general for election-related crimes, last week on grounds that he broke a code of conduct.  His summary dismissal came just days after an explosive interview with newspaper Reforma in which Nieto accused Emilio Lozoya, the former boss of state oil firm Pemex and a senior member of Pena Nieto s 2012 campaign team, of writing to him to ask that he be declared innocent of funneling Odebrecht cash into the president s campaign. Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht is at the heart of a Brazilian bribery and kickback probe, known as Lava Jato or Car Wash, that has reverberated across Latin America. Javier Coello Trejo, Lozoya s lawyer, said on Wednesday he had filed two criminal complaints against Nieto, alleging the former prosecutor had violated laws governing criminal proceedings, broadcaster Televisa reported.  Nieto s firing angered opposition politicians and has even threatened to delay discussions among lawmakers about next year s budget.  In Wednesday s television interview, Nieto denied breaking any rules, or revealing any sensitive information.  I didn t violate any code of ethics,  said Nieto, who was leading the probe targeting both Lozoya and the president s campaign. The Senate is due to vote in coming days on whether to reinstate Nieto, but it is still not clear when the vote will be and if it will be public.  In a sign of how tempers have frayed over the issue, opposition lawmakers have promised to delay voting on the 2018 budget until Nieto s case is resolved. The dispute is complicating efforts to shake off graft allegations that could hurt the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) ahead of next year s presidential election. Nieto could not be reached immediately for comment on Wednesday. Both the president and Lozoya, his close ally, have previously denied involvement in any wrongdoing related to the 2012 campaign. Mindful that corruption has become a key issue in the 2018 election, the PRI has overseen the arrest of various former state governors. Lozoya poses a more difficult challenge, given his proximity to the president. Opposition lawmakers have also criticized a decision by the Senate s governance body to hold the Nieto vote in private, vowing to appeal against the ruling. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1

Tillerson tells Myanmar army chief U.S. concerned about reported atrocities,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke on Thursday with Myanmar s army chief and expressed concern over reported atrocities against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Tillerson urged the army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, to support the Myanmar government in ending the violence and allowing the safe return of ethnic Rohingya who have fled the area, the statement said. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Rakhine state in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, mostly to neighboring Bangladesh, since security forces responded to Rohingya militants  attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown. The State Department is considering formally declaring the crackdown on Rohingya Muslims to be ethnic cleansing. In his call with Min Aung Hlaing, Tillerson also urged the Myanmar military to facilitate humanitarian aid for displaced people, allow media access and cooperate with a U.N. investigation into allegations of human rights abuses, the State Department said. Pressure has mounted for a tougher U.S. response to the Rohingya crisis ahead of President Donald Trump s maiden visit to Asia next month when he will attend a summit of Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, in Manila.

'At the doors of starvation:' siege strangles Damascus suburbs,"EASTERN GHOUTA (Reuters) - A tightening siege has pushed people to the verge of famine in the eastern suburbs of Damascus, residents and aid workers say, bringing desperation to the only major rebel enclave near the Syrian capital. Cases of malnutrition among children have almost doubled in the last two months at one clinic in the suburbs, which have been under siege by Syrian government forces since 2013 but come under new pressure this year as tunnels used to smuggle in food have been cut off.   The child that we consider normal in Ghouta is the child whose weight is on the lowest end of the normal weight scale. We don t have fully healthy children. The main reason is the lack of food and nutrition,  said Dr Amani Ballour, a paediatrician.  There are children who we previously classified as at risk of malnutrition, who are now classified as medium-level acute malnutrition or extreme-level acute malnutrition cases.     At two and a half years old, Hala al-Nufi weighs less than five kilos (12 pounds). She suffers from a metabolic disorder, but a lack of adequate food has made the case extreme. Hala, her eyes hollow and her translucent skin stretching over her tiny bones, had gotten sicker in recent months, her parents said. They worry she will not survive the siege. Um Said, a mother of six, says she is too hungry to breast feed her six-month-old twins, Marwa and Safa.  I put the child to the breast, but there is no milk. I am not eating. I slept without supper last night,  she said.  Sometimes I hit myself against the wall,  she said.  For God s, sake open the road. In the name of the prophet, I kiss your hands and feet, open the road for us. We are going to die of hunger. We are eating from the trash bins.  At least 1,200 children in eastern Ghouta suffer from malnutrition, on the rise with 1,500 others at risk, a spokeswoman for the U.N. children s agency UNICEF said.  We could be at the doors of starvation, of a medical catastrophe,  said health worker Mahmoud al-Sheikh. He said children were not yet dying of hunger but could be soon.  God help the people in the coming time.  The army s advances in recent months have shrunk the rebel-held pocket in the densely populated area of satellite towns and farms east of the capital. Food, fuel and medicine once traveled across frontlines into the suburbs through a network of underground tunnels. But early this year, an army offensive nearby cut smuggling routes that provided a lifeline for around 300,000 people in the enclave. Supplies have barely entered in months. Shortages have sent prices soaring even higher. Residents and local aid workers say they fear the worst if nothing changes when the cold arrives and stocks run out. A kilogram of sugar now costs more than 5,000 Syrian pounds ($10.81 dollars), roughly 14 times the state-regulated price in nearby Damascus. Two malnourished babies died this week after the siege aggravated their illnesses, a local official said. Photos of one of them   a skeletal baby girl   brought widespread attention to a crisis that has been growing there for months. Linda Tom, a spokeswoman for the U.N. humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) in Syria, said the one-month-old girl, Sahar, had congenital abnormalities. Hunger worsened her condition, and the baby died of pneumonia.  Through a series of offensives and evacuation deals, the Damascus government has defeated opposition pockets around the capital. Eastern Ghouta has held out, but residents say there is now talk for the first time of agreeing to evacuate.  People are under pressure, they will erupt. There is no baby milk at all. Mothers and fathers are watching their children go hungry. They want a solution in any way, at any price,  said Adnan, 30, who runs a local aid group. Families relied on crops they harvested in the summer, and meagre food distributions from warehouses run by the opposition government based in Turkey, he said. Adnan s group had preserved and dried vegetables that it will distribute to 1,500 families next week, but besides that, its food aid has halted.  Even if I get funding, there are no goods to buy,  he said.  The eastern Ghouta has shut down. There is a state of paralysis.  The Wafideen crossing at the outskirts, where checkpoints allowed some goods to enter, has also been heavily restricted or shut, the U.N. and residents said. Only two aid convoys have reached the Ghouta since July, each with food and medicine for about 20 percent or less of the population.  In July, Moscow and rebels in the Ghouta signed a ceasefire that had sparked hopes of opening crossings and aid flowing into the suburbs. But residents say none of that has materialized. The  de-escalation  deal reduced the barrage of air strikes and artillery, but the siege only got harsher, they said. Fierce ground battles also rage on in some frontline districts. When people in the Ghouta learned of the deal and thought it would bring relief, many began using up their food reserves at home, said Khalil Aybour, head of the local council in the town of Douma.  After they saw it was all rumors,  he said,  the misery grew immensely.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
Pakistan's youthful population creates education challenges,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani private schools, charitable institutions, and religious seminaries are stepping in to supplement government-run schools to help deal with the education needs of a fast-growing nation with an estimated 50 million school-age children. Despite 220,000 schools nationwide, Pakistan has over 20 million out-of-school children, according to a 2016 government report. The government has pumped money into schooling, with the education budget swelling by 15 percent every year since 2010, according to education consultancy Alif Ailaan. The United Nations puts the current budget at 2.65 percent of GDP, roughly $8 billion, or around $150 per student.    But experts say the government can t meet all the education needs and part of the problem lies in quality of teaching rather than just dearth of money.  It s not the number of schools, it s the quality, the attitude,  said Zeba Hussain, founder of the Mashal Schools which educate children displaced by war in the country s north. Situated on the outskirts of Pakistan s capital Islamabad, the charitable schools began when Hussain met a group of refugee children while visiting the hills encircling the city.  Many private institutions criticize what they describe as a deeply flawed government education system.   Students are labeled  smart  or  stupid  right from the start,  said Shaista Kazmi from Vision 21, a privately-funded NGO that runs speed literacy programs for out-of-school children that compress five years of reading proficiency into one.  Federal education director Tariq Masood strongly disagreed with critiques of teachers, adding that population growth and funding were the biggest challenges faced by government schools.   No one who is underqualified can enter the government system, there are fewer checks in the private system,  Masood said.  Masood said government schools adhered to a nationwide curriculum that was being constantly reworked and innovated.  The country s poorest often send their children to one of the thousands of religious madrassas (the Arabic word for school) where students are boarded, fed, and given an Islamic education. Most operate without government oversight.  Pakistan s madrassas have become synonmous with creating militant fighters through hardline teachings of Islam and many have been linked to organizations such as the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  But many provide shelter, three full meals, and a good education to young people whose families are unable to make ends meet.

Mattis visits Seoul for defense talks as tensions climb,"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis flew into Seoul on Friday for annual defense talks as tensions with North Korea climb ahead of a visit to the region next month by President Donald Trump. Mattis has emphasized diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis during his week-long trip to Asia, even as North Korea s weapons tests and bellicose verbal exchanges between Pyongyang and Washington stoke fears of an armed confrontation.  I carried the message that the more we do together today the greater the chance for enduring peace in the future,  Mattis said earlier this week, looking back at three days of meetings with Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.   That s really what it was all about   to keep the (North Korea) effort firmly in the diplomatic lane for resolution.  Even before landing in Seoul, Mattis held a meeting in the Philippines on Monday with his South Korea and Japanese counterparts, where they agreed to keep bolstering intelligence sharing about North Korea and enhance exercises.   Now we got to do the  roll up our sleeves  (work) and do the pragmatic planning and coordination,  he told reporters. Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera warned the threat from North Korea has grown to a  critical and imminent level . CIA chief Mike Pompeo said last week North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent.  U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to denuclearize. The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities for  flagrant  human rights abuses, including killings, torture, forced labor and the hunting down of asylum seekers abroad. Mattis is expected to meet South Korean leaders on Friday before he joins the top U.S. military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, at the annual  Security Consultative Meeting  with South Korea s military on Saturday. The visit comes just before Trump s departs on Nov. 3 to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, a trip which is expected to be dominated by the nuclear and ballistic missile threat posed by North Korea. Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies. Kim has blasted Trump as  mentally deranged.  Despite the rhetoric, White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the standoff. But all options, including military ones, are on the table.  Mattis, for his part, dismissed the idea that U.S. allies were confused about the U.S. approach, noting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson s recent trip to Beijing to get China to do more to pressure Pyongyang.  China is North Korea s biggest trading partner.   Do we have military options in defense for attack, if our allies are attacked? Of course we do. But everyone is out for a peaceful resolution,  Mattis told reporters traveling with him earlier this week.  No one s rushing for war.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1
No role for Assad in Syria's future: Tillerson,"GENEVA (Reuters) - President Bashar al-Assad and his family have no role in the future of Syria, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday ahead of peace talks aiming at a political transition scheduled to resume next month. Tillerson said that the Trump administration backed the Geneva peace talks as the only way to end the more than six-year-old war and move to a political transition and elections. He was speaking after holding talks with U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, who announced that stalled peace talks between the Syrian government and still-to-be-united opposition would resume in Geneva on Nov. 28.  The United States wants a whole and unified Syria with no role for Bashar al-Assad in the government,  Tillerson told reporters in the Swiss city at the end of a week-long trip that took him to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Pakistan and India.  It is our view and I have said this many times as well that we do not believe that there is a future for the Assad regime and Assad family. The reign of the Assad family is coming to an end. The only issue is how that should that be brought about.  When the Trump administration came into office it took the view that it was  not a prerequisite that Assad goes  before the transitional process started, he added. Supported by Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, Assad appears militarily unassailable and last month Assad ally Hezbollah declared victory in the Syrian war.    Those forces have pushed Islamic State back from large swathes of eastern Syria in recent months and over the past year have taken numerous pockets of rebel-held territory around Aleppo, Homs and Damascus.  My reading is that Assad is here to stay for as long as the Russians and the Iranians have no alternative to him,  a Western diplomat told Reuters.  The date of his departure will depend on the Russians more than anyone else. Once - or if - they find someone better, he may go.  Ceasefire deals brokered by Russia, Turkey, Iran and the United States in remaining rebel-held areas of western Syria have freed up manpower for Assad s allies. Tillerson called his discussions with de Mistura  fruitful  and said the United States will  continue our efforts to de-escalate the violence in Syria . He said the only reason Assad s forces had succeeded in turning the tide in the war against Islamic State and other militants was  air support they have received from Russia . Tillerson said Iran, Assad s other main ally, should not be seen as having made the difference in the defeat of Islamic State in Syria.  I do not see Syria as a triumph for Iran. I see Iran as a hanger-on. I don t think that Iran should be given credit for the defeat of ISIS (Islamic State) In Syria. Rather I think they have taken advantage of the situation.

U.S. appoints new top official at Havana embassy as tensions flare,"HAVANA (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it had designated career diplomat Lawrence Gumbiner as the new chief of its Cuba embassy that has been at the center of a diplomatic crisis due to allegations of mysterious health attacks on its personnel. The previous charge d affaires, Scott Hamilton, left Cuba earlier this month after Washington ordered the evacuation of all non-essential staff and all relatives, in order to remain with his family. Gumbiner will arrive at a time of heightened tensions between the old Cold War foes. While the United States has not formally accused Cuba of carrying out what it says are attacks that have caused hearing loss and cognitive issues in its diplomats, U.S. President Donald Trump said last week Havana was responsible. [nS0N1MD016] In an interview with Reuters, Cuban government officials accused him this week of slandering their country. [nL2N1MZ2CH] The tensions over the attacks, some of which involved high-pitched sounds, came after Trump said in June he wanted to partially roll back the historic detente between the United States and Cuba, ordering tighter restrictions on travel and trade with the island. These have yet to be unveiled. [L3N1JD40J] Gumbiner, a lawyer, has served for the past three years as Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Lima, Peru, according to the website of the U.S. embassy in Havana. Before that, he was deputy permanent representative at the U.S. Mission to the Organization of American States. He has previously held embassy positions in Bogota, Tel Aviv and San Jose.

Rome's Trevi fountain runs red after man pours dye in water,"ROME (Reuters) - The waters of Rome s Trevi Fountain, one of Italy s top tourist attractions, turned red on Thursday after a man dumped dye into the main pool, a city official said. Police detained the man responsible, a statement from the mayor s office said, as city officials assessed if there had been any damage to the 18th century landmark. The fountain, where tossing a coin into the pool is supposed by superstition to guarantee one s return to the eternal city, is a big tourist attraction in Rome. Actress Anita Ekberg famously frolicked in the fountain s pool in the 1960 film  La Dolce Vita .  Acts like this demonstrate ignorance and a total lack of civic sense,  Deputy Mayor Luca Bergamo said. Italian media said the culprit was the same person who dyed the fountain red in 2007 to protest the cost to the city of hosting an international film festival. Thursday s action took place on the opening day of Rome s 2017 film festival. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Explosion kills three Chadian U.N. peacekeepers in northern Mali,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Three United Nations soldiers from Chad were killed and two others wounded by an explosive device as they were escorting a convoy in northern Mali on Thursday, the peacekeeping mission in the West African nation said.  More than 80 members of the UN mission, known as MINUSMA, have been killed since 2013 in attacks by militant groups active in the country s north and center, making it the world s deadliest peacekeeping operation.  The mission said in a statement that the peacekeepers  vehicle struck the explosive device between the northern towns of Tessalit and Aguelhok around 2:30 p.m. (1430 GMT).  MINUSMA spokesman Olivier Salgado later told Radio France Internationale that the soldiers involved were from Chad, which has one of the region s most effective armies.  I condemn with the greatest energy such abject acts, whose only objective is to destabilize the country and harm the peace process under way in Mali,  said interim mission chief Koen Davidse. The rise of jihadist groups - some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State - in the arid Sahel has alarmed Western powers like France, which has deployed thousands of troops to the region in response.  Four U.S. Special Forces troops were killed earlier this month in neighbouring Niger by fighters believed to belong to a local Islamic State affiliate operating out of Mali. Militants have exploited porous borders - particularly between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso - to step up attacks on military and civilian targets, including tourist sites in regional capitals. The G5 Sahel, an anti-terrorism taskforce of soldiers from those three countries, as well as Chad and Mauritania, plans to launch its first joint operations in the coming days.

U.S. envoy Haley makes emotional visit to Congo displaced camp,"KITCHANGA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley was moved to tears on Thursday after visiting a nearly decade-old camp for Congolese displaced by violence in the country s east, and insisted there has to be a way to hold  safe and fair elections.  Haley, the most senior member of President Donald Trump s administration to visit Democratic Republic of Congo, traveled by helicopter to Mungote camp in Kitchanga, home to some 15,000 displaced people.  Dozens of excited children waved as Haley left on a U.N. peace-keeping helicopter to return to the provincial capital of Goma. She was visibly upset.   The reason I got emotional today was the hundred-plus kids that were chasing our cars and seeing us off,  Haley told  reporters after the visit.  All I kept thinking was, what s going to happen to them? The sad reality, as it looks now, is that they are going to end up just like their parents.  A single mother named Angelique told Haley she had been raped twice.  It s hard for her when she sits in the kitchen with her seven children because they watched her getting raped,  Haley said as she recounted what Angelique told her.  She doesn t know what to say to them,  Haley said.   No one should live like this. We can t turn a blind eye to all of this,  Haley said.   Congo is the final stop on Haley s week-long Africa visit, which has also taken her to Ethiopia and South Sudan, where she met with President Salva Kiir. On Friday she is due to meet with Congolese President Joseph Kabila, who has been in power since 2001 when he took over from his father.  Congo has never had a peaceful transition of power, and Kabila refused to step down when his second elected term ended in December, fueling insecurity in a country where millions died in conflicts between 1996-2003, most from hunger and disease. Under an accord struck on Dec. 31 between Kabila s representatives and opposition leaders, Kabila is barred from trying to change the constitution to stand for a third term.  We have to find a way to have a peaceful situation,  Haley said.  We have to find a way for them to have safe and fair elections, so we that we can get some leaders that know how to handle this situation and get these armed groups to stop.   The Congolese electoral commission said earlier this month that an election to replace Kabila cannot take place before April 2019, a delay that the opposition said would cause an impatient population to  take matters into its own hands.  The largest U.N. peace-keeping mission is deployed in Congo, costing more than $1 billion annually. Haley is reviewing all operations in a bid to cut costs, as the United States is the largest contributor, paying 28 percent of the budget. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly agreed in June to a $7.3 billion peace-keeping budget, a cut of some $600 Million. The Congo operation has to cut $93 million. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that any further budget cuts could harm the U.N. mission in Congo.  The state is still absent from many parts of the country and all too often preys on the citizens it is meant to protect,  Guterres wrote in a report to the 15-member Security Council last month Peace-keepers kept watch while Haley was at Mungote camp in Kitchanga, where she also visited a small bakery started by 50 women.    They re making a profit and they just bought a sheep with the profits that they made,  she said.  So it s inspiring to see they re not just sitting here complaining, they re trying to make the best of the life that they have.  ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Split in Temer ruling coalition likely dooms reform agenda,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer faces a split in his coalition that is likely to derail his plans to put Brazil s financial house in order after a majority of Congressmen from his main ally party voted to put him on trial on graft allegations.  The lower house of Congress voted 251-233 on Wednesday to shelve the corruption case against Temer, ensuring his survival in office. But the president s reform agenda appears in tatters, with little chance of passing an effective overhaul of the costly social security pension system after most Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) lawmakers opted for him to go on trial. In the biggest revolt yet against his 13-month-old government, 23 Congressmen for the PSDB voted to have him stand trial before the Supreme Court, with only 20 supporting the president.  With his coalition in disarray, Temer cannot muster sufficient votes to pass a pension reform that is the cornerstone of his efforts to plug a budget deficit that has scared off investors. Temer celebrated his Wednesday victory by proclaiming that  the truth had won out  and said his government would return to its task of recovering Brazil from its worst ever recession.  His chief of staff Eliseu Padilha said pension reform talks would resume within days. However, Temer did not even win a simple majority on Wednesday night in the 513-seat lower house.  That simple majority is needed to pass any new laws, and was far from the 308-vote super majority required for a constitutional amendment such as the pension reform bill.  I don t see it being approved, or even debated,  Fabio Sousa, a first-term PSDB lawmaker, said of the pension reform.  His government is fragile and there are general elections next year.  Sousa believes there were grounds to put Temer on trial for graft and he wants to see his party break with the government and withdraw its four ministers from the cabinet. Many in the PSDB, while backing economic reforms like those Temer has proposed, think they need to come from a more legitimate government. Temer s popularity has sunk below that of impeached leftist Dilma Rousseff who he helped oust last year. Brazil s stocks, foreign currency and other financial markets reacted calmly to Wednesday s vote, with ups and downs far below 1 percent, a sign that Temer s survival by a narrow margin was well priced in.  Everyone knows Temer is a lame duck now, and nobody believes in social security reform anymore,  said Fabio Knijnik,  managing director for Sao Paulo-based wealth fund K2 Capital. He said that if even the smallest pension reform passes, it would be a big surprise and plus for investors.  Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles told journalists the government would insist with its current proposal of a minimum retirement age and stricter rules for pension benefits. The pension bill would make Brazilians retire later in order to stave off a financial collapse of the social security system. Many lawmakers, including those who voted to spare Temer from a criminal trial, are reluctant to vote for an unpopular bill with elections approaching in 2018.  It is clear that a broad pension reform will not be approved in Congress by the Temer administration. But some changes are possible,  political analysts at Brasilia-based consultancy Arko Advice wrote in a report this week. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"German coalition talks stumble on migration, climate","BERLIN (Reuters) - Three German parties resigned themselves to further talks next week to try to form a new coalition after making little progress on Thursday in bridging deep divisions on immigration and climate policy. Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to unite her divided conservative alliance, which suffered bruising losses in a national election last month, in a pact with two other parties that is untested at federal level. After 11 hours of talks on Thursday, negotiators said they had failed to find much common ground on the difficult topics of climate change and immigration, but would take the weekend to consider the arguments of the other parties.  We hope to take further steps in the course of next week,  Nicola Beer, general secretary of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), told journalists. Immigration was the most divisive topic, with many conservatives keen to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on Merkel s decision to open Germany to more than a million mainly Middle Eastern migrants in 2015 and 2016. An agreement reached between Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian CSU sister party to cap annual refugee numbers had to be the basis of any coalition accord, Andreas Scheuer, CSU general secretary, said after Thursday s talks.  That is really going to be the crunch point,  he said, adding that the issue was the reason for the gains of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the election. Party leaders would meet to seek a solution on refugee policy by next Thursday, sources close to the talks said.  The environmental Greens, who oppose a refugee cap, said positions were far apart on immigration:  The debate on this topic was calm and constructive but the differences remain serious,  said Greens negotiator Michael Kellner. The parties did agree to stick to climate goals that envisage cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2020, but were still divided on how to achieve that, sources familiar with negotiations said. Kellner reiterated the Greens  position that Germany should quickly close coal-fired power stations to help fight climate change, a position resisted by the other parties.  We are the first generation to experience climate change and we are the last generation who can stop it,  he said.  The parties made limited progress on European policy, agreeing a broad-brush statement that said that  Germany can only do well if Europe does well  while listing 25 open points for further debate. Politicians say it could take months to form the coalition, leaving Germany hobbled as the European Union looks to its wealthiest country for leadership on governance reform. In a nod to ambitious European reform plans laid out by French President Emmanuel Macron, the statement said Franco-German cooperation was  of paramount importance to us.  The parties  negotiators agreed to further discuss EU reform issues including a euro zone budget - an idea pushed by Macron - and the future of the euro zone s rescue mechanism, the ESM. Sources close to negotiations said there was a consensus against a euro zone budget, but the parties did not want to immediately reject Macron s proposal. The statement stressed that talks with Britain on leaving the EU must respect the interlinkage of the bloc s principles of free movement of capital, citizens, goods and services, which could suggest that Berlin wants to take a hard line with London. Kellner said the parties were far apart on the ESM, which some conservatives want to see play a stronger role in preventing economic crises in the euro zone. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"Catalonia's leader rules out snap election, crisis deepens","MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia s leader Carles Puigdemont on Thursday said he would not hold a new regional election to break the deadlock between  Madrid and separatists wanting to split from Spain, sharpening a political crisis that could turn into direct confrontation. Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election to head off moves by Madrid to take direct control of the autonomous region in the next few days. But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said the central government had not provided sufficient guarantees that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.  I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,  Puigdemont said. He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to break from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 - a vote which Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop. Some independence supporters are pushing him to unilaterally declare independence. Late on Thursday, the regional government s business head resigned over his opposition to a unilateral declaration, a sign of growing division in the separatist movement. Puigdemont s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate on Friday to approve the take-over of Catalonia s institutions and police, and give the government in Madrid the power to remove the Catalan president. But this could spark confrontation on the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a Senate committee, said:  The independence leaders have shown their true face - they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.  The aim of Article 155   the constitutional trigger for direct rule   was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said. The Spanish government has said it would call such a vote within six months of taking over Catalonia. The political crisis, the gravest since Spain s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country. It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent. It was not clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate s authorization to do so without making it effective on the ground. Exactly how the central government would enforce it in practical terms, and how Catalan civil service and regional police would react, is also uncertain. National police used heavy-handed tactics to try to prevent the Oct. 1 referendum from taking place, drawing accusations that they were resorting to the repressive behavior of the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship. However, in a fast-moving battle of wills that has seen both sides stake out hard positions and try to keep each other guessing, it was not impossible that a sudden breakthrough could  be made in the next 24 hours. Spain's IBEX .IBEX closed up 1.9 percent as hopes of such a breakthrough fueled optimism among investors. Catalonia contributes a fifth of Spain's economy, the fourth-largest in the euro zone. Most Spanish blue-chips posted substantial gains, notably Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC) and Banco Santander (SAN.MC), both up 3.2 percent. CRACKS IN PRO-INDEPENDENCE CAMP According to Spanish media, Puigdemont is ready to call an election if the government drops Article 155, releases two senior secessionist leaders who are in jail and removes national police from Catalonia. Even if the Senate voted for direct rule on Friday, Puigdemont would not be stripped of his powers until Saturday when the law is published in Spain s official state gazette. Ander Gil Garcia, a spokesman for the Socialist group in the Senate, said:  We are in the last hours of the penultimate day in which we can avoid what nobody wants.  He appealed to Puigdemont to call a regional election  and avoid a disaster from which Catalonia and Spain would take a long time to recover.  A regional election could either strengthen Puigdemont s mandate if pro-independence parties won or allow him a graceful exit if they did not. Cracks though are beginning to appear in an increasingly-frustrated Catalan independence movement. The Catalan government s business head, Santi Vila, who has opposed a unilateral declaration of independence, said on Thursday he had resigned and said his  attempts at dialogue had failed.  Earlier on Thursday, when it was thought Puigdemont would announce an election, he was denounced by some angry independence supporters as a traitor. Several hundred gathered outside the regional government headquarters in protest. Some pro-secession lawmakers and mayors announced they would step down. Catalonia s pro-independence party ERC would leave the regional government if Puigdemont called a snap election, a party source said.  And far-left party CUP, which supports Puigdemont s minority government, said it would oppose a vote. Albert Ribas, a 37-year-old hotel director listening to a radio in Barcelona s Sant Jaume Square, said it had been a hard day.  We have lost our dignity. But I suppose we had to show the outside world that we re still making the effort to talk to the Spanish government. But again we see we have hit a wall.  ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

Turkey's release of German citizen sign of thawing ties: Gabriel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Turkey s decision to release a German human rights activist is a sign of improving relations between the two NATO allies, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Thursday, adding that Germany wanted all its citizens detained in Turkish prisons freed. Peter Steudtner, who was released on Wednesday night, was one of about a dozen German or Turkish-German citizens arrested in Turkey in recent months, souring relations that had deteriorated over German criticism of mass arrests in Turkey after a failed coup last year. Steudtner arrived back in Berlin on Thursday evening and was escorted off the plane by German police, fellow passengers told Reuters.  This is the first sign of a thaw, as Turkey has fulfilled all its commitments (in the case of Steudtner),  Gabriel told Der Spiegel magazine, adding that former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had mediated to secure his release. Spiegel had reported that Schroeder flew to Turkey on Sept. 25 to discuss the issue of German detainees with President Tayyip Erdogan.   Now we have to work on the release of the other detainees,  Gabriel added. Eleven German citizens are still in detention in Turkey, including four with Turkish-German dual citizenship. Relations between the two allies deteriorated after Erdogan launched a crackdown on political opponents after a failed coup last year. Germany has criticized mass arrests and refused to extradite people Turkey says were involved in the plot. Relations with Turkey are a contentious issue in talks on forming a coalition government that Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative bloc is holding with two other parties after she lost support in an election last month. In a televised debate with her main opponent before the election, Merkel said she would seek an end to Turkey s accession talks with the European Union. This hard position is backed by the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of her Christian Democrats (CDU), but opposed by the Greens, who along with liberal Free Democrats are seeking a coalition with the conservatives.

"Venezuelan anti-Maduro governor sacked, opposition in chaos","MARACAIBO/CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - The newly elected opposition governor of Venezuela s western Zulia state was dismissed on Thursday by the pro-government local state legislature, adding to disarray among foes of the ruling socialists.  The sacking of Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of five opposition governors in Venezuela s 23 states, came after he refused to swear loyalty to an all-powerful national legislative superbody aligned with President Nicolas Maduro s ruling socialists.   They held a secret, express session to remove him,  Guanipa s spokeswoman Erika Gutierrez told Reuters of the morning meeting of Zulia s state legislature.   Venezuela s opposition Democratic Unity coalition, which groups several dozen anti-Maduro parties, has been in crisis since a surprise defeat at this month s state elections. Despite polls showing it would win a comfortable majority due to widespread public anger over Venezuela s brutal economic crisis, the opposition only took five states compared to 18 for Maduro s Socialist Party candidates. Opposition leaders blamed dirty tricks by the government, including the last-minute moving of many vote centers in opposition areas, along with abstention by supporters disillusioned at the failure of protests earlier this year. Driving home its advantage, the government said only governors who recognize the supremacy of the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly could take office.  Four opposition governors did that this week, sparking recriminations and bickering within the coalition, but Guanipa said he would never  kneel before the dictatorship.   This is an assault on the will of the people,  he tweeted after his removal on Thursday, denouncing a  coup  in the oil-rich state on the border with Colombia. OPPOSITION IN-FIGHTING Prior to this week, the opposition, along with various major foreign nations including the United States, had refused to recognize the Constituent Assembly.  Elected in July after four months of anti-Maduro protests, the body has overridden the opposition-run national congress.  One major opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, said he would no longer participate in the coalition while Henry Ramos, leader of the Democratic Action party whose four governors swore themselves in before the assembly, was a member. Capriles  Justice First party, and the Popular Will party of detained opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, have called for a complete reformulation of the opposition grouping. Officials from Maduro down have been rubbing their hands in glee at the opposition implosion, and cheekily urging the controversial Ramos - a polarizing figure unpopular among young opposition militants - to stand for president in 2018.  Backstabbing has broken out in the opposition, all against all,  crowed Maduro earlier this week. The Constituent Assembly also announced on Thursday local mayoral elections would be held in December, giving the opposition a short time-frame to develop strategy.  Popular Will has already said it plans to boycott that vote. Young protesters, who saw hundreds of their fellow demonstrators jailed, injured or even killed in anti-Maduro street protests earlier this year, are disgusted by what for them is now a bleak political scenario. More than 125 people, including supporters of both sides plus security officials and bystanders, died in four months of unrest that Maduro said amounted to a U.S.-backed coup attempt.  Let the people continue speaking loud and clear in defense of peace, sovereignty and the sacred right to self-determination,  Constituent Assembly head Delcy Rodriguez said, announcing the December municipal vote that the socialists now expect to win handily given the opposition s disillusionment.

Further isolation of Venezuela may be needed: Latin American group,"TORONTO (Reuters) - A regional Latin American grouping on Thursday agreed more steps may be needed to further isolate Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro has been accused of stamping on rights and democracy, said Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland. She spoke to reporters after a Toronto meeting of the Lima Group, which also includes Canada. The group has already condemned what it calls recent anti-democratic acts by Venezuela s government.  If necessary we must put added pressure on the Maduro regime by taking concrete steps to further isolate it from the international community,  she said. Freeland added that Canada was mulling a second round of sanctions against Venezuelan officials.  Other countries should consider doing so as well,  she said. Last month Ottawa said it would impose targeted sanctions against 40 Venezuelan senior officials to punish them for  anti-democratic behavior . The Lima Group has around 15 members, including Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Mexico. It is next due to meet in Chile in January 2018. Last week the group criticized a nationwide election held in Venezuela, when the ruling Socialist Party took 18 of 23 governorships in a nationwide vote despite widespread anger over economic hardship, that has left millions suffering food shortages, a currency collapse and soaring inflation. Opposition protests this year have led to 125 deaths, thousands of arrests and injuries, and widespread damage to property and infrastructure. The opposition is starting to fragment and the Lima Group meeting on Thursday called on groups to work together.  It s a very important point. The people of Venezuela, in their struggle to reestablish democracy in their country ... deserve an opposition which is united and can represent them effectively,  said Freeland.

Sanctions on North Korea may hurt citizens' rights: U.N. expert,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - International community sanctions on North Korea may be hurting key economic sectors and hampering the human rights of its citizens, a United Nations expert said on Thursday.  It is my conviction that a comprehensive assessment of the sanctions regime is needed in order to avoid unintended negative impact on human rights,  said Tomas Ojea Quintana, the U.N. s special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea, in a speech to a U.N. committee. Ojea Quintana said the sanctions must be evaluated to avoid imposing  what would effectively constitute a collective punishment  on North Koreans. The rapporteur said Pyongyang was ultimately responsible for protecting the human rights of its citizens, yet  patterns of grave violations  persisted. The U.N. Security Council last month strengthened sanctions against Pyongyang, including export bans as well as asset freezes and travel bans on various officials, over the country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test so far, conducted on Sept. 3. On Thursday, the United States unilaterally imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities over what it called serious human rights abuses, including forced labor. Ojea Quintana highlighted the  deplorable  conditions of detainees in detention centers near the border with China including widespread sexual and gender-based violence.

"Boycott, shooting and tear gas mar Kenya election re-run","KISUMU, Kenya (Reuters) - Kenyan opposition supporters skirmished with police and threw up burning barricades in pockets of the country on Thursday, seeking to derail President Uhuru Kenyatta s likely re-election with a low voter turnout. The election commission said that more than one in 10 polling stations failed to open. Voting was delayed until Oct. 28 in four of Kenya s 47 counties - all in the opposition-supporting west - due to  security challenges . The repeat election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, which considers Nairobi a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi. In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.  In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.  Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.  Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections, but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.  In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.   With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote. The election commission said Thursday s estimated turnout was 48 percent, excluding the counties where voting did not take place.   We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,  Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting.  We re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it s time to move forward.  A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread. As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.  The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,  a statement from the European Union said.  Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.  In  Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after the  disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.  In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a  suicide mission . Reuters found no polling stations open.  Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.  Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says  OK , it won t happen,  said social worker Christine Onyango. Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few  brave enough to defy Odinga s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.  Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,  he said.  In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted a dozen polling stations there after voting closed. The highest turnout was 89 voters out of 793.        We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,  a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time. Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.  I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,  she said, her nose bleeding. On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.  Odinga s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.  The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.  ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
U.N. rights rapporteur condemns harassment of journalists in Iran,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A U.N. special rapporteur said on Thursday there had been little change in the human rights situation in Iran over the past year, voicing outrage over the harassment of journalists and adding that progress on women s rights was extremely slow. A day after submitting her report to the world body, Asma Jahangir, the U.N. special rapporteur on the Iran rights situation, told reporters that torture was widespread in Iran and that some people were imprisoned for seeking justice. Jahangir said she had not attempted to assess the impact of sanctions on human rights in Iran in her report because she had not been allowed to visit the country, which does not recognize her mandate. Iran rejected Jahangir s report as biased.  The report is politically-motivated, illegitimate, rancorous and disreputable,  Iranian state TV channel IRINN quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi as saying on Thursday. Iran says Western countries use the issue of human rights as a political tool to apply pressure on it. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

Extremes of devotion mark last goodbye to Thai king,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A woman s 750-km (470-mile) trek to see the late Thai king s cremation ceremony was only one example of the level of religious devotion on display in Thailand on Thursday. Thailand s semi-divine  father  was idolized like no other modern monarch. A year of mourning has done nothing to diminish that veneration as Thailand marks a final end to his era with his cremation, uncertain of what is to follow.  I have walked a long way until all my toe-nails have fallen off,  said 61-year-old Montha Suchit, who set off in mid-September from Nakhon Si Thammarat in southern Thailand.  This is the least we can do to repay him,  she told Reuters as she waited, clad in black like most of Thailand, for King Bhumibol Adulyadej s funeral procession to pass by. Thousands spent days camped on torn cardboard boxes to secure a spot near the procession with only plastic sheets for protection from intermittent monsoon rain and tropical sun.  He was the lifeblood of the nation,  said Sorana Theppanao, 60, who counted himself lucky to have got a place near the procession by sleeping out for three days.  King Bhumibol developed a very personal following with hikes to remote villages and an emphasis on helping the poor despite the royal family s immense wealth. He cultivated an image of being above coups and protests while intervening in times of crisis. The royal image was enhanced by a well-funded public relations apparatus. It was also protected by laws that meant anyone insulting it could get a long jail sentence.  The circumstances and propaganda were crucial, but the individual made it all work the way it did, and hence the Thais  deeply emotional final farewell,  said Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University. Some mourners questioned whether the king would have wanted such an ostentatious sendoff, for which $90 million was budgeted. Upstream of Bangkok, some districts were left flooded after heavy rains so waters could not disrupt the spectacle.  We all came out to thank the king personally, so in that sense the extravagance was not needed and does not reflect the late king s attitude,  said 70 year-old Tip Boonmak. As the procession passed, mourners dropped to their knees, many still holding up mobile phones to record the scene.  This is the last day we meet him before he goes to heaven,  said Kannika Kamsikeaw, 39. For foreign visitors, the emotion was hard to comprehend.  It s incredible to see this humungous outpouring of devotion,  said 34-year-old Australian Celine Massa.  I don t feel that emotion for any public figure.  More than 95 percent of Thais were born during King Bhumibol s reign, marked by economic transformation and political turbulence through which he was a stabilising figure. King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who has succeeded his father, does not have the same following. Recently, he has spent much of his time in Germany, where his son is at school. Asserting his new power, he has required changes to the constitution and taken personal control of the palace s financial holdings.  Besides drawing a line under King Bhumibol s era, the cremation is a step towards the military government s promised revival of politics and an election next year. For more than a decade, politics in Thailand was torn between  yellow shirts  - royalists dressed in the king s color - and  red shirts , who backed a populist movement whose governments were twice overthrown by the army. But any animosities were hidden on Thursday on the streets of Bangkok.  Today there is no color,  said Napthanicha Chantarasena, 33, among those who had camped out for days.  There is only my king.

Colombia ex-rebels begin building 'commune' cities in rural areas,"AGUA BONITA, Colombia (Reuters) - Colombia s former Marxist FARC rebels have begun to construct  communes in rural areas once torn apart by violence, part of their bid to reintegrate into society following a peace deal with the government. More than 11,000 fighters and supporters of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have demobilized under last year s deal, ending its part in a half-century war that has killed more than 220,000 people.  The group is now a political party, known as the People s Revolutionary Alternative Force, maintaining the FARC acronym in Spanish. The deal has been met with skepticism by many Colombians, who oppose ex-rebel participation in politics and have demanded jail sentences for leaders accused of murder, kidnapping and  sexual violence. Former rebels living in the nascent town of Agua Bonita, in southern Caqueta province, say a communal model will help alleviate deep socio-economic inequalities in Colombia, where the rural poor often lack access to public services.  This is a project that will create conditions for a dignified life, where people aren t just guaranteed dignified housing, but also health, employment, education,  Federico Montes, an ex-rebel and community leader told Reuters. The town, which has 65 modest houses, is carved from Caqueta s jungle and plains, long the scene of battles between the rebels and the military. It is so far home to 250 former combatants and their families, and has a library, health center, communal store and bakery.  Towns like Agua Bonita will help fight the country s high poverty rate and offer a model for communal living in line with leftist beliefs, Montes said.  We want to build a small model of what a more just, more equal and most of all more humane Colombia could be, where people have basic services and jobs,  he said. The FARC were founded in 1964 as the armed wing of the country s Communist party and revere Marxist leaders like Che Guevara. The group has long nurtured ties with socialist and communists governments in Venezuela and Cuba. While local ex-rebels see the commune projects as a chance to build local left-wing utopias, national FARC leaders are more cautious. When asked whether the communities would be run as communist enclaves, Pastor Alape, a leader of the FARC party, angrily denied they would have such an ideology and said any suggestion would open them up to criticism that they want to run independent states. Many FARC members have expressed fears they could be targeted for assassinations in a repeat of the 1980s killings of some 5,000 members of the rebel-allied Patriotic Union party, which grew out of a failed peace process with the government. Residents have begun to plant pineapple, plantain and cassava and plan to hand over the $2,700 they are supposed to receive from the government after demobilization to the community. Agua Bonita is protected by the police, while the army operates nearby in an effort to combat crime gangs who are trying to move into former rebel territory and take control of lucrative coca crops, the base ingredient in cocaine.  We need to be united to survive,  said 34-year-old Danilo Ortiz, who spent two decades as a FARC fighter, as he sewed a boot in the town s shoe-making workshop, set along a neat red dirt street. Rebels are looking for opportunities in areas that have not had state presence for years, Joshua Mitrotti, the head of the country s reintegration agency, said on a visit to Agua Bonita. The town is a  good start  to integrating rural areas and could be replicated if it gets sufficient support from the government, said Jean Arnault, the head of the United Nation s verification mission in Colombia.

"Four killed, 11 injured as train collides with army truck in Finland","HELSINKI (Reuters) - Four people were killed and several injured when a train crashed into an army truck during a military exercise in southern Finland on Thursday, police and the armed forces said. The accident occurred at an unguarded railway crossing near the city of Raasepori, 90 km (56 miles) west of the capital Helsinki, when two military vehicles were crossing the tracks on their way to a training site. The train and one of the vehicles collided, killing three soldiers aboard the truck and a passenger on the train, officials said. Road conditions were bad in the morning due to rain and snowfall. Inspector Ilkka Kantola told Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that the train had hit the truck at a speed of around 100 kilometres per hour. According to Kantola, the train driver had seen the truck but thought that it would stop as it was driving very slowly.  The train put on the break but the speed did not necessarily slow down at all ahead of the collision,  Kantola was quoted as saying. The soldier who had driven the truck will face charges for endangering traffic safety and manslaughter, he added. Four people were taken to Helsinki with severe injuries and seven others were treated at a local hospital for minor injuries. All patients were said to be in stable condition. Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila and President Sauli Niinisto both offered their condolences to the victims and their families.  The young conscripts were there for their country. That their journey ends in many deaths and in serious injuries is a true tragedy,  President Niinisto said in a statement. Military service is obligatory for men in Finland.

"In Nairobi slum, rock-throwers, police keep voters at bay","NAIROBI (Reuters) - It had all the trappings of a proper polling station - ballot-boxes, pots of indelible ink, registration lists and a dozen election officials dutifully seated behind school desks. The only things missing were the voters. In Nairobi s Kibera slum, a hot-bed of support for veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, many young men failed to heed his call for a peaceful stay-away from Thursday s election, a re-run of an August presidential vote annulled by the courts. After opening six hours late because of a lack of security, the polling station at Kibera s Olympic Primary School came under attack from stone-throwing youths determined to ward off any voters. Police at the gates responded with volleys of tear gas followed by live rounds, sending gangs of youths chanting slogans against President Uhuru Kenyatta scurrying for cover in the warren of streets and tin-shacks next to the school walls. Riot officers then sealed off the area, making it impossible for even residents to get through, let alone would-be voters prepared to run the gauntlet of pro-Odinga peer pressure.  I don t want to vote. I just want to go to my home,  said 24-year-old Kevin Ouma-Sigiria, after being turned back by armed riot police blocking the rubble-strewn road 500 metres (1500 feet) from the school. As he spoke, another man tried to talk his way through the road-block, only to receive a prod in the chest from a wooden club, followed by a nonchalant whack around the ankles.  There is a crisis up there,  one of the riot officers, who idenitified himself only as Kevin, said.  If they come one-by-one, that s OK. But if they gather again, the crisis will get bigger.  Moments later, 35-year-old Said Mohammed scurried down the street in the opposite direction with his wife and three small children to pack them off to relatives living up-country.  It s not good for their health,  he said, clutching his children s hands as the pop of exloding tear-gas grenades echoed across the tin roof-tops. Other opposition strongholds in western Kenya saw similar unrest, causing the election commission to postpone voting there until the weekend - although there is little prospect of a 48-hour delay yielding a different outcome. In Kibera, polling station staff should have slept overnight at the Olympic school but were unable to do so because of fear of being attacked. As it was, they arrived under armed escort at 10am - four hours after voting was meant to start.  The ballot boxes, also escorted by a heavily armed police contingent, arrived an hour after that - not that there was any chance of them being used.  Nobody is going to vote here today,  said Olympic deputy presiding officer Jaqueline Onuko, blithely tucking into a sandwich as rocks clanged against the metal roof of the classroom-cum-polling station.  The first time around was very busy...They were here queueing at 3 in the morning. Now nobody is going to come. They are scared of both the police and their neighbors.

Putin ally wins right to develop prime Moscow plot: sources,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A company with ties to an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin has won the right to develop a prime piece of Moscow real estate near the Kremlin, two sources familiar with the deal told Reuters. Moscow city government auctioned off the plot, which lies on the bank s of the Moskva river and includes a number of historic buildings, and it was won by a construction company called Gorkapstroy-Garant, according to the city. The two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that the firm represents the interests of businessman Gennady Timchenko. Reuters was not able to independently verify that Timchenko, who has been described by the U.S. Treasury Department as a member of Putin s inner circle, has a financial interest.  A spokesman for the Volga Group, which groups together Timchenko s business interests, did not respond to telephone calls or to an emailed request for comment on Thursday. The plot is a few hundred meters from the Kremlin, and some of the buildings on it date back to the 18th century. Under a development plan presented by the Moscow city government in August, the winning bidder will preserve and restore historic buildings, turn one of the buildings into a hotel and convert some of the complex into apartments.           Timchenko has since 2014 been subject to U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow for its role in the Ukraine crisis.  No contact details are listed for Gorkapstroy-Garant. Its parent company, Gorkapstroy, did not respond to a written request for comment. Staff were unable to connect a Reuters reporter by phone to Gorkapstroy s boss. The site had been used as a training facility for Russia s Strategic Rocket Forces, the arm of the military which operates Russia s nuclear arsenal. It became the property of Moscow city a few years ago.  ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

"Strike brings Athens Metro to a standstill, streets gridlocked","ATHENS (Reuters) - The Athens Metro came to a standstill on Thursday when workers in the Greek capital began a 24-hour strike to oppose the possible privatization of the rail operator. The strike disrupted the daily commute for thousands of Athenians and caused gridlock on streets leading to the city center.  Metro workers are protesting the transfer of Attiko Metro operator and other state-owned enterprises to a sovereign wealth fund set up under the latest international bailout with the EU and the IMF. Proceeds from the fund, known as the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations, will help Greece cut its debt burden and fund investments. Privatizations have been a pillar of Greek bailouts since 2010 but have reaped poor revenues so far amid bureaucracy and opposition by politicians and unions. Greece is aiming for 5.5 billion euros from state asset sales by 2018, when its bailout expires. Big tickets this year include the sale of a 66 percent stake in the natural gas grid DESFA and a 67 percent stake in the port of Thessaloniki. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Italian Senate approves electoral law; likely to produce hung-parliament,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy s upper house Senate approved on Thursday a new electoral system that is expected to handicap the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement at a forthcoming national election and favor mainstream political blocs. The bill has already been approved by the lower house thanks to a battery of confidence motions that swept aside all opposition and now only needs a green light from the head of state to become law. This is expected in the coming days. The voting system, a mix of proportional representation and first-past-the-post, will benefit parties that form pre-election coalitions   something the 5-Star has always ruled out. With opinion polls pointing to a three-way split between the centre-left, centre-right and 5-Star, analysts say the new electoral law will not produce a clear-cut winner at the next election, which is due by May 2018. Italy has had 64 governments since the end of World War Two, including five in the past seven years, and a renewed bout of political instability in the euro zone s third-largest economy could hurt global financial markets. To prevent a financial backlash, analysts say some form of grand coalition between the more moderate parties on the left and right is likely to emerge from any ballot-box stalemate.  You are all the same. You don t have any ideas or any policies, just the same mission: to keep hold of your seats and continue to squeeze the country dry,  the 5-Star Senate leader, Giovanni Endrissi, told the upper chamber on Thursday. Polls show the 5-Star is currently the most popular party in Italy, with support at around 30 percent nationally. President Sergio Mattarella had called on parliament to draw up a new law to harmonize the existing voting rules that risked throwing up different results in the two houses.  All previous attempts at reform fell foul of political infighting but, unexpectedly, the ruling Democratic Party (PD) of former prime minister Matteo Renzi struck a deal with Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia party over a revised voting system. The rightist Northern League also backed the initiative.  This law is the fruit of delicate mediation between coalition and opposition parties, which are very different parties with very different interests,  said Luigi Zanda, PD Senate leader. This will be Italy s third electoral law since 1993 and gives political leaders the power to pack electoral lists with supporters, potentially stifling internal party debate. The first-past-the-post element will benefit parties that have a strong local base, notably the Northern League, which looks set to win a large majority of seats in the wealthy north. Under the new system, IXE pollsters predicted on Thursday that a centre-right bloc made up of Forza Italia, the Northern League and Brothers of Italy party would win 269 of the 630 seats up for grabs in the lower house.  Renzi s PD allied with a small centrist party would take 180 seats and 5-Star 153 seats. A small bloc of leftist parties that have rebelled against Renzi, would take 20 seats, IXE said. Approval of the electoral law leaves parliament with one final task to complete before the houses can be dissolved   the reading of the 2018 budget. That legislation is expected to be passed by Christmas, which could open the way for national elections as early as March. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Somalia's al Shabaab stones woman to death for cheating on husband,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia s Islamist group al Shabaab on Thursday publicly stoned a woman to death in a town in the south for cheating on her husband, an official told Reuters.  Al Shabaab, which has been waging a war for years to topple the Horn of Africa country s western-backed government, seeks to  bring in rule based on its strict interpretation of sharia law.  Sheikh Mohamed Abu Abdalla, Al shabaab s governor for Somalia s Jubba regions in the south, said Habiba Ali Isak, a 30-year-old mother of eight children, was killed by stoning in Sakow on Thursday afternoon. Sakow, a town about 515 km (320 miles) southwest of the capital Mogadishu, is in an area entirely under al Shabaab s control. Members of al Shabaab have in the past handed out harsh punishments for religious infractions including hacking off of limbs for alleged thieves and public executions.    Isak lived with her legal husband and children in Hagar village in Jubba, but cheated on her husband after she told him she was traveling to Mogadishu to visit her relatives, Abdalla said. Her legal husband, Ali Ibrahim, subsequently found out his wife did not go to Mogadishu but instead had married again and was living with another husband in Sakow.  Her legal husband brought the case to the court. She admitted she illegally married a second husband,  Abdalla said.  According to the Islamic sharia she was publicly stoned to death this afternoon.  The offending second husband had fled, according to Abdalla. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

"In Mexican slum, a decades-long wait for quake relief","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - I first visited Camp No. 3 a few days after the Sept. 19 earthquake.  After reporting from collapsed buildings around the city, this was a different type of shock. Row after row of tiny tin shacks crammed into a small lot hidden behind a high fence in the middle class neighborhood of Lindavista. Here, hundreds of families who lost their homes in an earthquake 32 years ago are living in deplorable conditions, with children and grandchildren born during the interminable wait for promised government-subsidized homes. The 1985 earthquake was a defining moment for the Mexican capital. The death toll is still disputed, but at least 5,000 were killed. Some say many more died. Three decades on, hundreds of its victims are still living in hovels in encampments across the sprawling city of 20 million and now the latest quake has made thousands more people homeless. On first impression the camp is a little menacing, the smell of marijuana hangs in the air and residents warn of thieves and petty crime they blame on new arrivals - people who have moved in to occupy shacks left by families who have received new homes.  A strong sense of community prevails among the 1985 earthquake survivors, necessary perhaps for families who share outdoor toilets and use bared electric cables to heat water to bathe. And as I have seen among many of Latin America s poorest people, there is resourcefulness. Most families had some kind of work, many setting up small businesses like food stands selling tacos, or makeshift photocopy shops on the roadside.  One woman made her living charging for toilet paper and access to a bathroom.  According to the leaders of the Lindavista camp, its ramshackle shacks are home to around 750 people, divided into roughly 250 families. There are almost 200 children who are the grandchildren of those originally resettled here, according to local leaders. At least six such camps exist in the capital. Mexico City s housing institute said that since 2016, it has delivered 173 homes to victims of the 1985 quake and expects to hand over 120 more before the end of next year.

"2,000 refugees have fled Cameroon to Nigeria in past two weeks: U.N. agency","ABUJA (Reuters) - More than 2,000 people have fled southern Cameroon and entered Nigeria over the past two weeks, fallout from renewed oppression of Angolophone Cameroonians in the predominantly French-speaking country, the United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is now preparing a  very conservative  contingency plan for as many as 40,000 people fleeing Cameroon, Antonio Jose Canhandula, the agency s representative to Nigeria, told Reuters in an interview in Abuja. A cycle of state repression fuelling separatism has raised concerns the majority French-speaking Cameroon may face a prolonged period of violence, after soldiers shot dead at least eight people in the country s two English-speaking regions on Oct 1.  Our fear is that the 40,000 might actually be an understatement in a situation where the conflict might continue,  said Canhandula. Cameroon s government  has sent security forces into southern Cameroon,  he said, adding that the country has now closed its borders with Nigeria. Demonstrations in Cameroon s English-speaking regions began nearly a year ago when Anglophone lawyers and teachers protested against having to work in French, saying it showed the wider marginalisation of the English-speaking minority. One of Cameroon s English-speaking regions in the country s west borders Nigeria s southeastern state of Cross Rivers. There, the UNHCR has been registering refugees, some of whom say they are fleeing violence, according to Canhandula. But Nigeria and Cameroon are already grappling with one of the world s worst humanitarian crises, in the Lake Chad region, with over 2 million people displaced after more than eight years of conflict with Islamist insurgency Boko Haram.  Can you imagine having another refugee situation in a country where we are hardly coping with IDPs (internally displaced persons)?  Canhandula said.  Every time you have a refugee situation you have it for several years... Cameroon really has to take the issues that create the feeling of exclusion very seriously,  he said. Cameroon s linguistic divide is a legacy of World War One, when the League of Nations divided the former German colony of Kamerun between allied French and British victors.

Finland wants EU to give up daylight saving time,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish government should actively push the European Union to abolish its directive on daylight saving time, a parliament committee said on Thursday. The parliamentary transport and communications committee gave its recommendation to the government after more than 70,000 Finns signed a citizens petition asking the state to give up the practice. Under daylight saving time clocks move forward by one hour during summer months so that daylight lasts longer into evening. Most of North America and Europe follows the custom, while the majority of countries elsewhere do not. The committee said that after hearing several experts, it concluded that people do not adapt smoothly to the changes. It added that turning the clocks caused short-term sleeping disorders, reduced performance at work and could also lead to serious health problems.  The primary objective should be to abolish the clock movements on uniform basis throughout the European Union,  the committee said in a statement. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

UK sets date for parliamentary showdown on crucial Brexit laws,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government said on Thursday its key piece of Brexit legislation would be debated in parliament on Nov. 14 and 15, the next stage in what is expected to be a tortuous lawmaking process that will test Prime Minister Theresa May s authority. The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is central to the government s plan to leave the EU in March 2019, repealing the laws that made Britain an EU member and transposing existing EU law into British law. But it has faced widespread criticism from lawmakers of all parties - including May s Conservatives - for giving the government too much power to change laws, and for not guaranteeing parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit. As a result, the bill s passage through parliament will depend on May s fragile minority government being able to pacify rebel lawmakers who said they were  deadly serious  about trying to give parliament a greater say on the terms of the EU exit. The much-anticipated first two days of debate were announced in parliament by Andrea Leadsom, leader of the lower house. Six further days of debate are planned but dates were not announced.  The bill passed its first parliamentary test in September and the next stage had been expected earlier by some lawmakers, but the government said it needed time to look over the hundreds of proposed changes which will be discussed.   Nearly 400 amendments have been tabled and we are looking at those with the utmost seriousness,  a Brexit department spokeswoman said.   We look forward to continuing the debate and working with Parliament to ensure that we deliver a functioning statute book on exit day.  Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker later warned that if the bill fails to pass through parliament in time for  Brexit day  on March 29 2019, holes would appear in the country s laws.  He also said the government currently planned separate legislation to implement the terms of the transitional agreement it is seeking to help smooth its departure from the EU, erecting another potentially difficult parliamentary hurdle. May s spokeswoman later said it was too soon to know for sure if this would be required. Among the proposed changes to the withdrawal bill, several have enough support from Conservative lawmakers to defeat May, who commands a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party. One of the potential Conservative rebels, Nicky Morgan, warned the government not to underestimate their desire to change the bill.  We are deadly serious,  Morgan, a former senior minister who was sacked by May last year, told parliament.  Any rebellion is expected to crystallise around government plans to offer lawmakers a vote on the final exit package.  The promise is not currently written into the bill, which will only allow lawmakers to accept the deal the government has negotiated with Brussels or reject it and leave the EU without a deal. Brexit minister David Davis angered parliamentarians on Wednesday by suggesting that vote could even come after Britain has left the bloc, forcing his department to issue a clarification. Called to parliament on Thursday morning to explain his words, Davis said he expected the vote to take place before December 2018 or January 2019, referring to the EU s preferred negotiating timetable. Despite his clarification, lawmakers signaled they wanted to have more say on the exit deal and would try to force the government into making concessions next month in parliament by guaranteeing in law a vote that gives lawmakers a greater say.  The sad reality is that ministerial assurances are no longer good enough,  said opposition lawmaker Stephen Kinnock. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

Cars torched in attack on French police housing complex,"LYON, France (Reuters) - Attackers set fire to vehicles beneath a housing complex for police and their families in a suburb of Grenoble, eastern France, on Thursday. Police said a fence around the building was closed off in an apparent attempt to prevent residents escaping and rescuers getting in, but all 24 people inside escaped unharmed.  Nobody claimed responsibility for the assault, which was the latest in a series of arson attacks against police and police vehicles.   Attacks like this can be tantamount to terrorism,  Grenoble prosecutor Jean-Yves Coquillat told reporters, adding that the method used was similar to other recent attacks by far-left groups.  Last month, such a group claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a police building in Grenoble that destroyed a warehouse and several cars.  The group said the fire was a protest against the trial of nine far-left activists accused of firebombing police in an assault on two officers in Paris in May 2016 that was caught on camera. Last month, five police cars were set on fire in Limoges, central France.  French police are on high alert after a series of Islamic State-inspired attacks that have killed more than 240 people in the past three years.  Aside from the Islamist threat, far-left and far-right militancy has also not let up. Police this month arrested 10 far-right militants suspected of planning attacks on mosques and politicians.

"Kenya opposition, ruling party MPs exchange blows at rival news conferences","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Legislators from Kenya s ruling party and opposition exchanged blows on Thursday, after polls closed in a controversial repeat presidential election.  Live national television showed MPs tumbling into a hedge at Nairobi s Panafric Hotel when the two sides clashed after attempting to hold near-simultaneous news conferences at the same venue. One lawmaker shouted profanities on camera, prompting nervous giggles from anchors.  The fistfight reflected larger tensions within the country, that saw polling stations in some counties unable to open after opposition leader Raila Odinga called for a boycott of the Oct. 26 poll, saying it would not be free and fair.  Odinga s withdrawal left President Uhuru Kenyatta as the only serious contender for the presidency, although six other candidates were also on the ballot. Kenyatta won a presidential poll on Aug. 8 that was later nullified by the Supreme Court on procedural grounds.   They (the government MPs) came here, instead of addressing their own issues, they started attacked Raila,  Anthony Oluoch, opposition MP for Mathare constituency, told Reuters at the Panafric Hotel after the brawl.  I was not engaging in physical violence, I was attacked by more than 10 or 15 people.   Opposition MPs said a joke against Odinga from Senator Kipchumba Murkomen from the ruling Jubilee party sparked the brawl, but the senator blamed the other side for the violence.   We met the ODM (opposition) MPs in the gallery, they asked me to buy them drinks, I bought them drinks. These people are just violent,  he said.      ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"Egypt election in view, Sisi supporters fire up campaign for mandate","CAIRO (Reuters) - Six months before Egypt s election, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi s supporters are petitioning for him to run, rallying around the former military commander whose popularity critics say has been dimmed by austerity reforms, security problems and a crackdown on dissidents.   Four years ago, Sisi won a landslide victory after he led the military ouster of then president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, promising stability following Egypt s 2011 Arab Spring uprising.   Sisi, 62, has yet to declare if he will run, though he is unlikely to face strong opposition. He says he will follow the people s will, and many in Egypt still see him as key to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has battered the economy.   But some critics say that narrative has been undercut by tough austerity reforms and a currency flotation that has made even the middle-class poorer, and an Islamic insurgency that has extended outside its battleground in the northern Sinai,     The  So You Can Build It  petition campaign launched by a businessman, professors and pro-Sisi independent lawmakers is looking to whip up turnout for Sisi and show he still has the legitimacy of a popular mandate. Less than a month into the campaign, its founders claim they will rally massive support. A host of celebrities have signed up, posing on social media with petition forms that show Egypt s red, white and black flag, and a silhouette of the pyramids.   We will find out from the numbers we have collected what the Egyptian people s support looks like ... especially since there are rumors that there s been a decline in popular support,  said Mohamed Shaaban, the campaign s co-founder and an independent lawmaker allied with Sisi.  Some Sisi opponents say the scale of the campaign shows that Egyptians have few viable opposition candidates to choose from in the election likely to happen around April.  All this negatively affects the political climate in Egypt and increases reluctance to run against Sisi,  Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, nephew of a former president who once backed Sisi but is now considering running against him, said last week.  It will discourage voters and make them more reluctant to go out and vote in the upcoming elections.  Detractors have taken to social media to poke fun at the petition, posting pictures of aliens and U.S. President Donald Trump signing the form. Others have suggested a counter-movement calling instead for Sisi to step down. Under Sisi s presidency, thousands of dissidents have been jailed, the government has shut down independent media and heavily restricted the conducting of opinion polls. There have been no official polls on the upcoming election yet.  However, many Egyptians are wary of challenging the status quo after six years of living through a pro-democracy revolt, a military takeover and a prolonged state of emergency that has left people unwilling to protest or looking for stability. Only two people   Sadat and Khaled Ali, a lawyer who challenged Sisi over a dispute about two islands in the Red Sea   have publicly aired the idea of challenging him and even they say Sisi is likely to win. Last election, Sisi won about 97 percent of the vote on a turnout of 47.5 percent, after voting was extended for a day. This time, his backers want to show his legitimacy not been tarnished by economic and security problems.   The issue is not whether Sisi will win the 2018 election; rather, it is about how much interest and buzz can be generated about the process,  said H.A. Hellyer, senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.  The more public interest, the better - if turnout and interest is minimal, that won t be catastrophic for the authorities, but is certainly not the image they wish to project domestically or internationally, he added. The campaign was inspired by the 2013  Tamaroud , or  Rebellion , petition, that Sisi used as a mandate to topple the Muslim Brotherhood, said Shaaban. The Tamaroud movement encouraged millions of Egyptians to take to the streets demanding the overthrow of Mursi. Sisi then led the military ouster of Mursi after those protests. Organisers says they are already seeing results. What started off with only 10 offices has mushroomed into a large-scale operation with 178 offices nationwide, said Shaaban, and close to half a million likes on the campaign s official Facebook page.  The numbers are changing by the moment,  said parliamentarian Karim Salem, campaign spokesman and co-founder. Organisers say the campaign is run by volunteers and funded by private donations. Egypt s state news agency reported that 14,000 people had signed the petition in the Nile delta province of Al-Beheira. Reuters could not independently confirm these numbers. The petition form lists five reasons why Sisi should seek a second term   cleansing the country of terrorism, completing his megaprojects, ending corruption, education, and protecting its leadership. Even some of Sisi s supporters who helped propel him into power, such as former campaign officials Hazim Abdelazim and Nour al-Huda Zaki, have turned against him over his handling of the economy and security. Critics point to a dispute that saw his government hand over two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, touching a nationalistic nerve. Egypt has fought an insurgency waged by an Islamic State affiliate in North Sinai since 2013. Hundreds of members of the security forces have been killed. But the group has begun turning its guns towards the mainland in attacks this year. Sisi has inaugurated mega infrastructure projects he promised would turn around the economy, and the IMF has praised the progress of measures it has backed that are meant to curb deficits and create long term growth. But many Egyptians say they are frustrated with the immediate fallout of reforms. The currency devaluation a year ago has cut the Egyptian pound s value in half   though it has stabilised now - and inflation is just off record highs of above 30 percent. In Shaaban s home district in Cairo, middle-class Sayeda Zeinab, where a petition campaign banner with an image of the smiling president hangs above a main square, Essam Moahmed, a baker, expressed discontent over the economy.  Now things are even more expensive than under the Brotherhood. But people can t stand against Sisi,  he said. Sisi acknowledges the tough economic situation many Egyptians face, saying sacrifices like IMF-backed austerity reforms are needed  so we can take our true place.  ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Sea of black in Bangkok as thousands flock to late king's funeral,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand bade a final goodbye to its beloved late King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Thursday in a ceremony steeped in ancient rituals, processions and Buddhist rites that drew hundreds of thousands of mourners. Despite heavy downpours, black-clad mourners crowded Bangkok s historic quarter where the king s cremation took place. The $90 million funeral marks the end of an era for many Thais who had only ever known King Bhumibol as their monarch. It ushers in the reign of the late king s son King Maha Vajiralongkorn, or Rama X, who ascended the throne last year but whose coronation can only take place after his father s funeral. King Vajiralongkorn has overseen sweeping changes to the royal household, including the running of palace finances. Earlier in the day members of the Thai royal family, visiting dignitaries and government officials placed sandalwood flowers at the royal funeral pyre. The cremation of King Bhumibol began with Buddhist religious rites and ceremonial candle-lighting by saffron-robed monks. Many of those lining the Thai capital s streets had slept overnight on pavements near the Grand Palace to capture vantage spots for the funeral procession that wended past buildings draped in yellow marigolds.  This is the last goodbye,  said one tearful visitor, Pimsupak Suthin, 42, who traveled from the northern province of Nan to attend the function.  I really love and miss him. It is very difficult to describe.  King Bhumibol, also known as King Rama IX, died last October aged 88 after ruling for seven decades. He played a pivotal role in maintaining stability during years of political upheaval and rapid development. At the start of the ceremony, officials dressed in blue and orange removed a symbolic golden urn from the Dusit Maha Prasart Throne Hall and carried it through the streets to a 50-metre (165-foot) -high royal crematorium in a nearby square.  The king s body was moved to the cremation area on Wednesday night from the palace, where it had been lying in state since his death.  New King Maha Vajiralongkorn presided over religious chanting in the afternoon prior to the cremation at the royal crematorium, which features nine spires to mark the reign of his father, the ninth member of Thailand s Chakri Dynasty. One of the late king s daughters, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, lit candles inside the crematorium. Thailand s supreme patriarch, Somdet Phra Maha Muniwong, led the religious ceremony, urging Thais to follow Buddhist teachings and  look beyond sadness . Royals from Bhutan, Britain, Japan, Lesotho, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden, among others, attended the funeral ceremony on Thursday. Performances   including the Thai Khon masked dance   punctuated the evening and added a festive air to an otherwise somber day.  Officials in charge of the ceremony said about 110,000 people had gathered near the cremation area, with 200,000 more nearby. The realisation of the king s departure was now sinking in, said funeral ceremony volunteer Petchpailin Jaidee, 60.   The cremation makes it real,  she added.  I feel like he is truly gone, and it feels like the sky is falling.  A sum of $90 million has been set aside for the funeral, the likes of which has never been seen in Thailand, officials have said, even though King Bhumibol was portrayed as a frugal man despite being one of the world s wealthiest monarchs. Elsewhere in the Thai capital and around the country, 85 smaller replicas of the royal crematorium and more than 870 pavilions were built for mourners to lay sandalwood flowers and pay their final respects. Sites to offer sandalwood flowers were also set up in 94 countries to give overseas Thais a chance to say good-bye. Some onlookers clutched pictures of the late king and several prostrated themselves as the urn passed by.  I was very fortunate to have been born under the reign of King Rama IX,  said Piyamat Potsopho, 38, adding that she had waited for the funeral procession since Wednesday night. In Nonthaburi province north of Bangkok, a long queue of black-clad mourners waited to place sandalwood flowers in a mark of respect, as volunteers handed out food. Analysts say the king s death has left a large vacuum in the Thai psyche. King Bhumibol is often referred to as  father  by Thais and is credited with reviving the popularity of the monarchy. Days of heavy rain failed to deter mourners, many of whom pitched tents to secure the best access to the funeral. Many businesses around the Southeast Asian nation were shut, while Bangkok s old quarter was draped in garlands of flowers. Some government buildings placed potted marigolds around the  portraits of the king. King Bhumibol was born on a Monday, a day that Thais associate with the color yellow. The king s ashes and bones will be collected in an early morning ceremony on Friday. (For a graphic on 'Thai King's Funeral' click tmsnrt.rs/2leWzcQ) ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"U.S.-led forces acknowledge killing 51 more civilians in Iraq, Syria","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants said on Thursday another 51 civilians had been killed in strikes in Iraq and Syria, raising the total number of civilians it has killed to 786 since 2014. The coalition said in a statement that during September, it had assessed 127 reports and the 51 additional deaths occurred in 16 incidents going back as far as February that it deemed were credible. The coalition, battling to defeat Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, says it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. The military s official tally is far below those of outside organizations. The monitoring group Airwars says at least 5,637 civilians have been killed by coalition strikes. Iraqi forces launched an attack to drive Islamic State from the last territory it holds in Iraq on Thursday and the Syrian army and its allies said they planned to march on the jihadists  last Syrian stronghold. The separate assaults across the Iraqi-Syrian frontier aim to deal a final blow to the Islamic State  caliphate  that has crumbled this year in Syria and Iraq, with the group losing the cities of Mosul, Raqqa and swathes of other territory.

U.S. House passes ballistic missile sanctions on Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Thursday for new sanctions on Iran s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement. The vote was 423 to two for the  Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act.  Among other things, it calls on the U.S. president to report to Congress on the Iranian and international supply chain for Iran s ballistic missile program and to impose sanctions on Iranian government or foreign entities that support it. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 13 he would not certify Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. Trump s action opened a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose sanctions on Iran s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement, but there has been no move to do so in the House or Senate. Aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the Hezbollah and missile-related sanctions. U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who sponsored the ballistic missile bill, has said the international nuclear deal should be strictly enforced by Washington working with its allies.  The United States must respond to the full range of threats and, with this bill.... that is what we are doing today,  he said. The House passed three other Iran-related measures on Wednesday, including new sanctions on Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia and a resolution urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. [L2N1N02UY] To become law, the measure would have to pass the U.S. Senate and be signed into law by Trump. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

NATO says Russia misled West over scale of Zapad war games,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO accused Russia on Thursday of misleading the alliance over the scope of its war games last month in violation of rules meant to reduce East-West tensions, but Moscow said NATO was stirring up anti-Russian propaganda.   At a meeting with Russia s ambassador to the U.S.-led alliance, Alexander Grushko, NATO envoys said that Moscow had given conflicting accounts of the exercises known as Zapad, or  West , in Belarus, the Baltic Sea, western Russia and its Kaliningrad outpost, diplomats said. NATO ambassadors pressed their message home at a meeting with Grushko at the NATO-Russia Council, a forum that was effectively suspended months after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in March 2014, but now meets regularly again. Russia s defense ministry said the war games included some 12,700 troops and ran from Sept. 14 to Sept 20, with a fictional scenario focusing on attacks by militants. NATO says there were far more troops than 12,700 and they simulated an attack on the West during August and September.  Saying they are concerned that large-scale, unannounced exercises could accidentally trigger a conflict in eastern Europe between NATO and Russia, Western allies have pressed Moscow to be clear about its military exercises and to invite more observers.  The number of troops participating in the exercises significantly exceeded the number announced before the exercise, the scenario was a different one and the geographical scope was larger than previously announced,  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after the meeting. Under a Cold War-era treaty known as the Vienna document, which sets out rules for exercises, war games that number more than 13,000 troops should be open to observers who can also fly over the drills and allow them to talk to soldiers. NATO did send one expert to a visitor day in Russia and two experts to a visitor day in Belarus.  NATO diplomats say Moscow massed some 100,000 troops from the Arctic to eastern Ukraine, where Russia backs separatists, and used ballistic missiles and electronic warfare to test its combat capability in Europe.  Grushko said NATO s assessment was wrong and NATO was wrong to lump all the exercises going on in Russia last month under the Zapad name.  NATO countries are counting all the military activities that took place in the Russian Federation and counting them as part of Zapad,  he told a news conference after the meeting.   We don t accept the propaganda about the Russian exercises,  Grushko said.  It was an unprecedented propaganda attack,  he said.         Some western officials have expressed concern that parts of the Baltic states, which have large ethnic Russian minorities, could be seized by Moscow, much as Russia took control of Ukraine s Crimea in 2014. However, Stoltenberg said that Russia had withdrawn its troops from Belarus after the Zapad exercises. Baltic countries had feared Moscow might leave them on NATO s borders.

"Iraq, Syria converge on Islamic State's last strongholds","BAGHDAD/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iraqi forces launched an attack to drive Islamic State from the last territory it holds in Iraq on Thursday and the Syrian army and its allies said they planned to march on the jihadist s last Syrian stronghold. The separate assaults across the Iraqi-Syrian frontier aim to deal a final blow to the Islamic State  caliphate  that has crumbled this year in Syria and Iraq, with the group losing the cities of Mosul, Raqqa and swathes of other territory. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Islamic State fighters would have  to choose between death and surrender  as he announced the offensive on the region of Rawa and al-Qaim, which is located at the Syrian border. The Iraqi air force dropped thousands of leaflets on the border area calling on militants to surrender and urging the population to stay away from their positions, according to a statement from the Joint Operations Command in Baghdad.  Tell those among your children and relatives who took up a weapon against the state to throw it aside immediately, and to go to any house on top of which a white flag has been raised when the liberation forces enter al-Qaim,  said the text. Regular Iraqi army units, Sunni tribal forces and Iranian-backed paramilitaries known as Popular Mobilisation are taking part in the offensive toward the Syrian border, the Joint Operations Command said. In a statement welcoming the offensive, the U.S.-led international military coalition which has run an air campaign against Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq since 2014, said approximately 1,500 Islamic State fighters were estimated to be still in the immediate vicinity of al-Qaim. In Syria, Islamic State has been driven back into a strip of territory along the Euphrates River by separate offensives waged by the Syrian government and its allies on the one hand, and by Syrian militias backed by the U.S.-led coalition on the other. A report issued by a military news service run by Hezbollah, which is fighting in support of Damascus, said on Thursday that the army and its allies had captured the  T2  pumping station from Islamic State. This was  a launch pad for the army and its allies to advance towards the town of Albu Kamal ... which is considered the last remaining stronghold of the Daesh organization in Syria , it said. Around 70 km (40 miles) from T2, Albu Kamal is located on the west bank of the Euphrates at the Iraqi border in the Syrian province of Deir al-Zor, just over the frontier from al-Qaim on the Iraqi side. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the Syrian army had advanced from T2 to reach 45km from the outskirts of Albu Kamal. Syrian government forces and their allies have made rapid gains against Islamic State in Deir al-Zor in recent weeks.  They have advanced mostly in areas to the west of the Euphrates River where they have captured the town of al-Mayadin and besieged the last Islamic State-held pockets of Deir al-Zor city. The U.S.-led coalition is waging a separate campaign against the group in Deir al-Zor, focused on areas to the east of the Euphrates River. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Former Liberian warlord endorses George Weah for President,"MONROVIA (Reuters) - Former Liberian warlord Prince Johnson has endorsed George Weah for president before a Nov. 7 run-off vote between the former soccer star and Vice President Joseph Boakai.  The endorsement should help Weah, who won 38.4 percent of the vote in the first round this month, more than anyone else but shy of the 50.1 percent needed to win outright. It also puts pressure on Boakai to drum up support from other candidates.  Johnson s endorsement of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in 2011 helped the Nobel Peace Prize winner get re-elected, though his influence has waned since then: he won 8 percent of votes this year, versus 11 percent in 2011.   I am humbled to announce ... my full and unflinching support in collaboration with the Congress for Democratic Change party of Senator George Weah,  Prince Johnson said at his Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction party headquarters.  The announcement follows two weeks of political wrangling, during which the two frontrunners from October s first round sought to gain support from a field of 18 other candidates.  Weah is popular and famous, mainly because of his star performances for Italian and French football clubs during the 1990s. But he lacks political experience, and his policies to alleviate widespread poverty and chronic under-development are vague, making extra support vital.  This is historic and we welcome that,  said CDC chairman Wilson Tarpeh. Johnson is  reading the writing on the wall. It tells you that the people of Liberia are tired of one-party  rule.  Johnson s attempt at playing kingmaker makes many in Liberia uncomfortable, given his role in the civil war that ended in 2003. In 1990, his band of troops took control of parts of the capital Monrovia to oust former president Samuel Doe, and he celebrated as the leader was executed. Still, his supporters are loyal and are expected to listen to his call to vote for Weah.   Johnson s backing will not win the vote alone for Weah, but it will certainly boost his prospects, especially as other candidates are also likely to throw their weight behind the opposition leader, sensing his momentum,  said Roddy Barclay, director at risk-advisory firm Africa Practice.

Legal challenge to UK ruling party's Northern Irish alliance fails,"LONDON (Reuters) - A London court on Thursday rejected a legal challenge against the deal between Britain s ruling Conservatives and a Northern Ireland party that allowed the government to cobble together a parliamentary majority in June. After losing their majority in a disastrous snap election on June 8, Prime Minister Theresa May s Conservatives secured support from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in return for a pledge to spend an extra 1 billion pounds in Northern Ireland. In a crowdfunded legal challenge brought by a Northern Irish citizen, lawyers argued that the deal, known as a confidence-and-supply agreement, was corrupt because it amounted to using public money to buy votes. But after a one-day hearing, the High Court rejected their arguments and denied permission for judicial review of the deal. The judges said neither of the grounds put forward against the deal was legally arguable. The challenge was launched by Ciaran McClean, a mental health worker and Green Party member living in Northern Ireland, who raised 92,000 pounds ($121,600) on a crowdfunding website and was present in court on Thursday. Lawyers acting for him told the court that  the Conservative Party purchased the political support of the DUP for the sum of 1 billion pounds  and that the deal was an offence under the Bribery Act 2010. Government lawyers responded that the public expenditure contemplated by the deal would be authorized by parliament, and that the criminal law of bribery did not apply to a confidence-and-supply agreement between political parties. On his fundraising page, McClean had written that the Conservative-DUP deal violated Northern Ireland s 1998 Good Friday peace agreement which ended decades of armed sectarian conflict in the province. Under the peace deal, the UK government is required to be impartial between unionists who want the province to remain part of the UK and republicans who aspire to become part of Ireland.  The government is threatening hard-won peace with their pact with the reactionary DUP,  McClean wrote. However, for technical legal reasons, that line of argument did not form part of the case heard by the High Court. May, who replaced David Cameron as prime minister after the Brexit referendum in June 2016, inherited a narrow parliamentary majority from him.  In April 2017, with opinion polls suggesting she had a double-digit lead over the opposition Labour Party, she called a snap election, hoping to increase her majority. But after an uninspiring campaign, they lost their majority. Support from the DUP s 10 members of parliament has enabled May to cling to power as Britain moves closer to the challenge of leaving the European Union. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Iceland's ruling Independence Party takes lead ahead of Saturday vote: poll,"REYKJAVIK/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Iceland s centre-right Independence Party has pulled ahead in an opinion poll before Saturday s parliamentary vote, the second snap election in a year after a string of political scandals. The Independence Party, which was part of every government from 1980 to 2009 and has been in power since 2013, got 24 percent support in a poll published on Thursday by Frettabladid, Iceland s largest newspaper. The Left-Green party polled at 19 percent, while the Social Democrats stood to get 14.3 percent of votes as the third-biggest party. Just a week ago, the Independence Party and the Left-Greens stood neck and neck in polls at just under 20 percent each. A victory for the Independence Party would give Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson the right to try to form a new government. The Pirate Party, which rode a wave of anger against the establishment to become the third-biggest party in elections a year ago, stood to get 9 percent of votes, Thursday s poll showed.

Czech election winner Babis meets anti-EU party in hunt for viable government,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech billionaire Andrej Babis s ANO party met an anti-European Union, anti-immigration group on Thursday in search of a coalition partner as it struggles to convert a huge election win into a majority government.   ANO won three times the votes of its nearest rival in last weekend s election that saw a popular swing from mainstream traditional parties towards outsiders, echoing a recent shift in Europe in favor of anti-establishment groups.  But with Babis facing potential fraud charges, which he denies, most parties have ruled out any tie-up with ANO although it won over many voters with pledges to run the state like a business and weed out political corruption. The post-election limbo raises the risk that the 2018 state budget might not be approved within the deadline of year-end and kept open the possibility that ANO could opt for minority rule supported by far-left and far-right factions. On Thursday, ANO met the Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party, which won 22 seats to ANO s 78. ANO has so far ruled out a block with the SPD but the two have found common ground on curbing immigration, a referendum law and welfare reform. ANO deputy chief Jaroslav Faltynek declined to say whether it would seek SPD support in a coalition or for a minority government.  We have not spoken with the SPD about a government today. We issued a clear stance, even before the election, that we would not form a government either with SPD or KSCM (Communists),  he told reporters.     Police are looking into whether Babis hid ownership of a convention centre that received a 2 million-euro EU subsidy in 2008 though it was intended for small businesses. He says the investigation was part of efforts to push him from politics. Babis has called single-party government unrealistic and says he aims to have a coalition by Christmas. He has been talking to the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, ANO s partners in the outgoing government, the SPD, Communists, conservative Civic Democrats and the liberal Pirates. Turning to the SPD could raise eyebrows in Brussels as the party has demanded a referendum on membership in the EU, a risky move in the eurosceptic-leaning country of 10.6 million people.

Hezbollah says U.S. sanctions aim to stir unrest in Lebanon,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Hezbollah member of the Lebanese parliament said on Thursday that proposed new U.S. sanctions against the powerful Iran-backed group aimed to provoke unrest in Lebanon. The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday endorsed new sanctions on the Shi ite Hezbollah militia, part of an effort to increase pressure on Iran. The new sanctions have not yet become law.   The sanctions law ... is a blatant interference in Lebanese internal affairs, a violation of its national sovereignty and an unacceptable targeting of the Lebanese people,  Hezbollah parliamentarian Hassan Fadlallah said in a televised statement.   America aims, through this aggressive behavior in legislation, to subjugate Lebanon, to stir unrest and deprive its people of development,  Fadlallah said. Hezbollah is in Lebanon s delicate, national unity government and fights alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria s more than six-year long conflict.  It is classified as a terrorist group by Washington and on Wednesday the House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the European Union to do the same.  One of the measures passed by the House of Representatives was an amendment strengthening the 2015 U.S. Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act (HIFPA) which aimed to sever the group s global funding networks.  When HIFPA was introduced it caused alarm in Beirut where the government feared major damage to the banking sector that underpins Lebanon s economy.  But Lebanon s central bank Governor Riad Salameh told Reuters on Tuesday Lebanon had mechanisms already in place to deal with any new sanctions. Salameh also said this week the American Treasury appeared content with how Lebanon was applying sanctions regulations.   They consider the measures which Lebanon s central bank has put in place to be sufficient , he said after a visit to the U.S., in a statement distributed by Lebanon s presidential media office.

At least five killed as police fire at protest in Ethiopia,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least five people were killed in a town in Ethiopia s restive Oromiya region on Thursday after police opened fire during a protest, witnesses said. Protesters had blocked the main road in Ambo, some 130 km (80 miles) west of the capital Addis Ababa, to demonstrate against sugar shortages, before police arrived to disperse the crowd.  They (police) then fired live rounds. We know of ... five people who died from gunshot wounds,  one of the protesters told Reuters. Another witness said he saw up to 10 wounded people taken to hospital. The regional government s spokesman confirmed that deaths had occurred, but did not give details.  Demonstrations happening in Ambo have resulted in death and injuries,  Addisu Arega Kitessa said in a Facebook statement, adding that they were organized by  enemies  of the region. The province was wracked by protests for months in 2015 and 2016. Nearly 700 people were killed last year in one bout of unrest provoked by plans to implement a development scheme for Addis Ababa that opponents said amounted to a land grab, according to a parliament-mandated investigation.  Broader anti-government demonstrations over politics and human rights abuse then followed, forcing the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was finally lifted in August.  Separately, ethnic clashes killed at least 11 people this week in the same region. Another bout of violence along Oromiya s border with the country s Somali region last month displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The developments highlight tensions in the country where the government has delivered high economic growth but it often accused of curbing political freedoms. The government denies clamping down on free speech and blames rebel groups and dissidents abroad for stirring up violence. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Hiroshima survivor to jointly receive Nobel Peace Prize with ICAN,"OSLO (Reuters) - An 85-year-old survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima will jointly accept the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize together with this year s laureate, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, ICAN said on Thursday. Setsuko Thurlow, who was 13 at the time of the bombing on Aug. 6, 1945, will be on stage in Oslo on Dec. 10 together with Beatrice Fihn, ICAN s executive director, to receive the Nobel Peace Prize award.   Thurlow has been a leading figure in ICAN since its launch in 2007,  ICAN said in a statement on Thursday.  She played a pivotal role in the United Nations negotiations that led to the adoption of the landmark treaty outlawing nuclear weapons in July.  Thurlow has for seven decades campaigned against nuclear weapons. Born in Japan, she now lives in Canada.  At Hiroshima, she was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building about 1.8 kilometres (1.1 mile) from Ground Zero. Most of her classmates, who were in the same room, were burned alive, she said in an account of her experiences.  In her speech announcing the prize in October, the leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee said the risk that nuclear weapons might be used was now  greater than it has been for a long time .

Germany investigating reports of refugees forced into prostitution,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German authorities are investigating reports that asylum seekers in a Berlin refugee camp were forced into prostitution, officials said, adding that they had not been able to confirm that such incidents had taken place. The allegations come amid heightened concern at Germany s ability to integrate the 1.1 million refugees who arrived in 2015 and 2016. The political parties negotiating to form a new national coalition government are arguing over whether to impose a cap on immigration numbers. Broadcaster ZDF reported on Tuesday that employees of a security company that runs several refugee camps in Berlin were luring asylum seekers, some of them minors, into prostitution. Both national government and Berlin city officials said they were investigating the allegations, and Berlin said its staff would be given further training to help them identify such cases.  If the allegations of security staff profiting from and driving refugees into prostitution are true, these would be very serious charges,  said government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.  Exploiting the material hardship in which many refugees and immigrants live is totally unacceptable. Forcing people into prostitution is morally reprehensible,  he said.

EU awards human rights prize to Venezuelan opposition,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Venezuela s democratic opposition was awarded the European Union s human rights award on Thursday and the European Parliament called for a peaceful transition to democracy in the troubled country. The prize, named after Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov, was awarded to Venezuela s opposition-led National Assembly legislature, which the government has stripped of powers, and all political prisoners, the EU parliament said. Venezuela is suffering from a harsh economic crisis and President Nicolas Maduro s government has clamped down on the opposition, jailing or otherwise barring from office many dissenting leaders and activists.  Today we are supporting a nation s freedom struggle,  European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said.  We also want to launch an appeal for a peaceful transition towards democracy and an opening of a humanitarian corridor to ease the suffering,  he added.     Julio Borges, head of Venezuela s National Assembly, tweeted that it was an honor to receive the award on behalf of the whole of Venezuela, adding:  The international community recognizes our people.  The European Parliament s left-wing group GUE/NGL, which includes parties such as Germany s Die Linke, Ireland s Sinn Fein and Greece s ruling Syriza, said it would boycott the award ceremony, saying the decision was politically charged. Previous winners of the prize, first awarded in 1988, include Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai and South African President Nelson Mandela. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

Germany needs to implement additional measures to reach the 40 percent emissions reduction goal otherwise it will only achieve a 32 percent cut in CO2 emissions. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Catalan leader Puigdemont set to call regional election,"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan president Carles Puigdemont is set to call a snap regional election, political allies said, a move that could help break a one-month deadlock between the Madrid government and separatists seeking a split from Spain. The uncertainty remained high however as Puigdemont who had announced he would deliver an address at 1.30 p.m. (1130 GMT), first delayed it by one hour and then canceled it, triggering speculation he could still change his mind. Several members of his pro-independence coalition said he would dissolve the regional parliament and call the vote. The regional broadcaster said he would deliver a speech in the assembly at 5 p.m., as had initially been planned.  Barcelona-based La Vanguardia said he would call the vote for Dec. 20 and was taking the decision in a bid to persuade the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy not to enforce direct rule in the region, which he might do as soon as Friday. The Catalan secessionist drive is Spain s worst political crisis since the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco ended in 1975. It has fractured society and hundreds of companies have left the region. It is also the most serious challenge to the integrity of a Western European country since an independence referendum in Scotland in 2014, when voters in the end chose to stay part of the United Kingdom. European leaders fear it could spur secessionist ambitions in other parts of the continent. But cracks appeared late on Wednesday in the independence coalition as some members backed an election while others said there was no alternative to independence. Within minutes of Thursday s developments, several pro-secession lawmakers and mayors announced they were stepping down.  I don t share the decision to call an election. I am resigning as a lawmaker and a member of PdeCat (Puigdemont s Catalan Democratic Party),  said Jordi Cuminal on Twitter. Several hundred people also took to the streets and gathered on Placa Sant Jaume, in front of the Catalan government s headquarters in central Barcelona.  Puigdemont traitor,  a big banner read. Far-left party CUP, a key support for Puigdemont s minority government, said it would oppose a vote.  Until now, pro-independence supporters had one problem: the Spanish state. If elections are called, they will have two,  it said on twitter. Demand for Spanish debt and shares jumped when it emerged Puigdemont could call an election. Spain s 10-year government bond yield - which moves inversely to price - fell 6 basis points to 1.58 percent on the news. The stock index IBEX rose 1.9 percent to a four-week high.  This news is positive for Spain because it looks like Puigdemont is looking for ways other than declaring independence,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.  It sounds like he is calling these elections so that Madrid does not have to invoke article 155,  that would allow central government to suspend the wealthy region s autonomy. It is not yet clear whether Rajoy will impose direct rule as planned or simply seek the Senate s authorisation to do so but stop short of making it effective. His government said earlier this week that calling a snap election would not be enough, and Puigdemont would also have to withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence he made on Oct. 10. An election could either strengthen Puigdemont s mandate if pro-independence parties won, or allow him a graceful exit if they did not. An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot, in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government.

"Turkish court remands Turkey's Amnesty chairman in custody, Amnesty says","ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court remanded Amnesty International s local board chairman in custody on Thursday, Amnesty Turkey said, hours after its local director was released by a separate court. The group s chairman, Taner Kilic, has been in prison since June in the coastal province of Izmir on terrorism charges. Prosecutors say he downloaded ByLock, a messaging application used by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based cleric  Turkey says was behind a failed coup last year. On Wednesday an Istanbul court ordered the release on bail of eight human rights activists, including the director of the local branch of Amnesty International, pending a verdict in their trial on terrorism charges. The Izmir court merged Kilic s case with that of the rights activists in Istanbul. The next hearing for all 11 defendants will be held on Nov. 22.  Over the last 24 hours we have seen the twin hands of Turkey s fickle justice system at play. While one grants liberty, the other, confronted with no less baseless charges, takes it away,  said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International s Secretary General.  The release... late last night restored some faith in Turkey s justice system. Today, that faith has been washed away.  Separately, prominent activist and businessman Osman Kavala s detention period has been extended for another seven days, one of lawyers representing him told Reuters. Kavala, who took part in several civil initiatives for the protection of human rights and resolutions of the Kurdish issues in Turkey, was initially detained at Istanbul s Ataturk Airport last week, as part of a secret investigation which drew reaction from Ankara s western allies. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said Kavala was behind the Gezi uprising, a referral to the 2013 mass protests against Erdogan s rule. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

"After Islamic State, ruined Raqqa fears new strife"," RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - The morning after Islamic State s defeat in Raqqa, a local militia fighter stood in a square in the ruined, deserted city center.  There will be more problems here,  he said.  The 19-year-old, who gave his name as Moro, was one of few Raqqa natives to witness the aftermath of the battle for the Syrian city. Victory celebrations by Kurdish forces felt muted - there were no civilians left. It was the  liberation  of a ghost town.   Daesh is to blame for this,  said Moro, an Arab who joined the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces militia alliance (SDF) to fight Islamic State, known pejoratively as Daesh, after fleeing Raqqa two years before.   But not everyone will see it that way. If destruction remains, people will blame the coalition, and maybe us.   The cost of the campaign to oust Islamic State from its former Syrian capital is the destruction of the city, the death and maiming of hundreds of civilians and displacement of tens of thousands.  As the dust settles, Raqqa s traumatized population fears new violence.  Rebuilding Raqqa, which resembles wrecked Syrian cities like Aleppo and Homs, will take years, meaning long-term homelessness for many - an issue already fuelling resentment against the forces that helped end Islamic State s detested  caliphate .  SDF supporters worry resentment will turn into unrest, pitting them against those who were more sympathetic to Islamic State, or who oppose what is increasingly perceived as Kurdish control of the majority Arab city.  The flags of the Kurdish YPG militia that spearheads the SDF were the first to fly above former Islamic State strongholds in Raqqa. Fighters chanted Kurdish slogans. The SDF declared the city would become part of Kurdish-led autonomy plans for northern Syria.  Many residents welcomed the U.S.-backed militias even as air strikes killed their relatives, saying the SDF at least treated them well.  But euphoria is giving way to a realization there is nothing for most to go back to. The U.S. State Department says it could be months if not longer before mines and debris are cleared and people can return.  Officials say frustration will be exploited by the SDF s enemies: Turkey, which is fighting a Kurdish insurgency of its own, and President Bashar al-Assad, who has vowed to retake all of Syria.  Raqqa has in turn been controlled by Assad, rebel groups and then the jihadists in Syria s six-year-old conflict. The forces now in control promise democracy and the council staffed by locals plans to hold elections.   We re done with Daesh. The regime can t return either,  Moro said, referring to Assad s Damascus-based government.  He stood at the spot where Islamic State whipped him 130 times for missing prayers. He and his brother spied on the group for the U.S. coalition by secretly filming key locations before his brother was found out and executed, he said.     Signs of Islamic State s brutality litter Raqqa. Fighters last week searched a former prison set up underneath Raqqa stadium. Some cells were not big enough to sit up in.  On Naeem roundabout, where jihadists held public executions, a local woman said she once counted 77 decapitated heads on spikes.  Some 260,000 people fled the fighting. For now, most live in crowded camps and abandoned buildings with barely any water, electricity, food or medicine.  Those who fled abroad are unlikely to return, relatives say.  The few locals to see Raqqa after the expulsion of Islamic State include SDF fighters and civilians who did not flee. Others are desperate to get in.  At a checkpoint on Raqqa s outskirts, a crowd of people displaced for months argued with militiamen, demanding to inspect their houses.   They say the area s mined. It s not, people have been across. You need connections. Kurds are allowed in,  Sara Hussein, 58, said.   Has Raqqa not been freed? It s over. We saw the parades on TV - we want to go home.   The SDF did not immediately comment but says it fairly represents all ethnicities in areas it controls.  The residents wanted to fetch winter clothes, worrying properties would be looted. One man said the SDF questioned him and confiscated his papers.  Others have been more thoroughly interrogated. They are among those Moro fears will resent the SDF.  A former Islamic State employee, who gave his name as Abu Furqan, was pushed out of Raqqa on his wheelchair by neighbours as they fled.  The 23-year-old had lost both legs in an air strike in August, and sat outside a mosque asking Red Crescent workers for painkillers. His wounds had been sewn up in an Islamic State clinic. Raqqa has no working hospitals.   I did odd jobs for Daesh - manning police checkpoints, and driving around distributing water to fighters. Will I be interrogated again?  he said.  Islamic State wages were good, he said.  He avoided questions about whether he still sympathized with jihadists or opposed the SDF, replying:  When Daesh first came, some people were more afraid of what the U.S. reaction would be,  a reference to air strikes.  The final days of the battle for Raqqa were marked by tension between the coalition and tribal leaders who demanded air strikes stop for the sake of trapped civilians while they negotiated safe exit for some militants, council officials said.  One tribal leader said the coalition should compensate bereaved families.  For now, people just want to return.  Moro kept muttering:  It s destroyed.   ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Serbia's pensioners rally against government austerity measures,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Hundreds of Serbian pensioners rallied in Belgrade on Thursday to protest austerity measures introduced as part of a 1.2 billion euro ($1.41 billion) loan deal with the International Monetary Fund. Chanting  thieves  and carrying banners reading  we are hungry , the pensioners demanded that the government and Serbia s constitutional court annul austerity cuts imposed in 2014 and refund lost pension payouts. The government of then Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic signed a three-year loan deal with the IMF in February 2015 after Belgrade committed to austerity to cut its ballooning debt and budget deficit. To secure the deal, in late 2014 it lowered public sector wages and pensions by between five and 25 percent.   As many as 700,000 people lost a quarter of their monthly income ... we ve been paying to that (retirement) fund for 45 years, hoping for a stable old age,  said protester Milorad Pavicic, 80.  About 1.7 million of Serbia s 7 million citizens are retirees and the government spends 13 percent of GDP on pensions, World Bank data show. The average pension in Serbia, a candidate to join the European Union, is 190 euros, among the lowest in eastern Europe. Earlier this month, Serbia s current Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said the government will raise wages for doctors, teachers and army officers by 10 percent and pensions by five percent from January next year.  Pensioners were also slated to receive a one-off payment of up to 6,000 Serbian dinars ($59.38) in 2017. Thursday s protesters dismissed the measures as insufficient. The government has yet to discuss the wage and pension rises with the IMF s mission, in a final review of the deal this month and next.  The lender cut Serbia s 2017 growth forecast to 2.3 percent from 3.0 percent, citing a drop in electricity output in winter and lower than expected harvest due to months of drought.

Philippines' Duterte orders army to recruit 10 new battalions to crush militants,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday ordered the new army commander to recruit and organize 10 new infantry battalions to crush remnants of pro-Islamic State militants, days after they were defeated in a southern city. The military on Monday declared victory over the Maute group, which seized control in Marawi City on May 23, after killing the last 40 remaining militants, including a few foreign fighters. More than 1,100 people, including 165 soldiers, died in the five-month conflict.  We were instructed to organize ten additional battalions,  new military chief Lieutenant-General Rey Leonardo Guerrero told reporters after Duterte installed him to head the 130,000-strong armed forces. One battalion comprises about 500 soldiers.  We really intend to put pressure and sustain effort to be able to finish all of them and complete the resolution of armed conflict in the country.  The Philippines has been waging protracted guerrilla warfare for nearly 50 years against Maoist rebels and Muslim separatists that has killed more than 160,000 people, displaced two million and stunted growth in resource-rich rural areas. Guerrero, who was promoted from army commander in Duterte s home region on the southern island of Mindanao, said the army had also been ordered by the president to try to defeat the 4,000-strong communist New People s Army. Duterte broke off negotiations with the Maoist rebels early this year due to continued attacks on mines, plantations, construction and other companies to raise funds, as well as attacks on isolated army and police outposts. The government is engaged in peace talks with Muslim separatists trying to carve out an autonomous region in the south, enlisting the main Moro Islamic Liberation Front to help fight a small group of rebels who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State.  We already have timetables and targets and I intend to meet that,  Guerrero, who only has two months to serve before he retires, said.  The military has a multi-year program, it s not dependent on personalities, but its tasks are lined up regardless of who assumes the leadership.    ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Former minister for Argentina's Fernandez arrested,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Julio De Vido, an ex-minister in former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez s government, was jailed after turning himself in to authorities on Wednesday, marking an anti-corruption milestone in a country known for impunity. Congress voted to strip former planning minister and current lawmaker De Vido of his parliamentary immunity earlier in the day, and he later appeared at a federal judge s chambers in Buenos Aires where he was taken into custody. He faces charges in two separate corruption cases. Argentina s Congress rarely removes lawmakers  immunity and De Vido is the most powerful official from the 2007-2015 Fernandez era to be jailed. Local television showed police escorting De Vido from the chamber but covered his face with riot shields. He was then driven to Ezeiza jail outside the capital city, where he will be detained indefinitely.  This is a scandal. In a state of law sentences are applied after a conviction,  De Vido s lawyer Maximiliano Rusconi told local television. Corruption allegations dogged Fernandez s government and isolated her politically ahead of a Senate race on Oct. 22. De Vido is under investigation in a case involving the Patagonian coal mine Rio Turbio. Prosecutors accuse him of embezzling state funds allocated for the mine. He has denied any wrongdoing. A three-judge panel ordered De Vido s arrest last week, saying he should be jailed to prevent him fleeing or interfering with the case.  Fernandez won a Senate seat for the province of Buenos Aires under Argentina s list system on Sunday, but finished second, lessening her chances of staging a comeback for the presidency in 2019.  De Vido was in charge of running energy infrastructure projects under Fernandez, a left-leaning populist who was succeeded by business-friendly President Mauricio Macri in late 2015.  Fernandez, the subject of corruption investigations herself, has acknowledged there was likely corruption during her government but denies personal involvement. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
U.N. rejects Myanmar claim that it agreed to help build housing for refugees,"YANGON (Reuters) - A UN settlement program, UN-Habitat in Myanmar, on Thursday rejected a state media report that it had agreed to help build housing for people fleeing violence in the northern Myanmar state of Rakhine, where an army operation has displaced hundreds of thousands. The development underscores tension between Myanmar and the United Nations, which in April criticized the government s previous plan to resettle Rohingya Muslims displaced by last year s violence in  camp-like  villages. More than 600,000 have crossed to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants sparked an army crackdown. The United Nations says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since then amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.         The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said on Thursday that UN-Habitat had agreed to provide technical assistance in housing displaced people in Rakhine and the agency would work closely with the authorities to  implement the projects to be favorable to Myanmar s social culture and administrative system .  But Stanislav Saling, spokesman for the office of the U.N. resident coordinator in Myanmar, told Reuters in an email that  no agreements were reached so far  after the agency s representatives attended a series of meetings with Myanmar officials this week in its capital Naypyitaw.   The UN-Habitat mission emphasized that resettlement should be conducted in accordance with the principles of housing and property restitution for refugees and displaced persons to support their safe and dignified return to their places of origin,  he said, responding on behalf of UN-Habitat. UN-Habitat welcomed the interest of the Myanmar government in international norms and standards, he added.  The United Nations  principles state that all refugees or displaced persons have the right to return to property or land from which they were arbitrarily or unlawfully removed.  Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return, but it remains unclear whether those refugees would be allowed to return to their homes.  Rohingya who return to Myanmar are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to Myanmar officials and plans seen by Reuters. Buddhist-majority Myanmar in August suggested that UN agencies such as the World Food Program have provided food to Rohingya insurgents, adding to pressure on aid groups which had to suspend activities in Rakhine and pull out most of their staff.  Still, Soe Aung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare who attended the meetings with UN-Habitat,  insisted that the agency had agreed to give assistance and the two sides will meet again on November 8.   We have reached an agreement with the UN for technical assistance. We will discuss more details on how to proceed,  he told Reuters.  The Myanmar military said on Thursday that it will withdraw  some  of the security forces carrying out clearance operations in northern Rakhine and dispatch them to the state capital, Sittwe, as an auxiliary force. Thousands of refugees have continued to arrive cross the Naf river separating Rakhine and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5.

UK's Johnson says Poles' post-Brexit rights protected 'whatever happens',"LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign minister Boris Johnson said Poles in Britain  will be protected, whatever happens  after Brexit, in comments publicized on Thursday that appeared to go further than Prime Minister Theresa May on guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens. Johnson was speaking on Oct. 17 at the Belvedere Forum on UK-Polish relations, according to the British Embassy in Warsaw in remarks which were reported by The Guardian newspaper on Thursday.   I have only one message for you all tonight, you know exactly what it is: You are loved, you are welcome, your rights will be protected, whatever happens,  Johnson said in a video posted by the embassy on its Twitter feed.  Earlier this month, May said it was a priority to protect EU citizens  rights and an agreement with the EU was near but the government has resisted calls to unilaterally guarantee their rights.  In a letter to EU citizens last week, May said:   I want to give reassurance that this issue remains a priority, that we are united on the key principles, and that the focus over the weeks to come will be delivering an agreement that works for people here in the UK, and people in the EU.  A Foreign Office spokeswoman said Johnson was not diverging from May s comments:  The Foreign Secretary was simply reiterating our determination to achieve this.   Last year there were just over 900,000 Poles living in Britain, according to the Office for National Statistics and Johnson praised their contribution to British life including through 30,000 businesses.  But some have returned home in recent months, concerned about their status following the Brexit referendum which many saw as a vote against recent immigration from Eastern Europe. Johnson, who is known for his outspoken comments, has professed loyalty to May in recent weeks but his interventions have been seen as undermining her authority, which was severely weakened after a botched June 7 snap election.

"On front page of China's flagship paper, Xi gets Mao-like prominence","BEIJING (Reuters) - The ruling Communist Party s flagship newspaper on Thursday provided more evidence that President Xi Jinping should be regarded as China s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong after this week s party congress. Xi s official portrait dominated the People s Daily s front page report on the unveiling of the party s new top leadership. Below that was a smaller group photograph of the new top leadership - the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee including Xi. It is a stark departure from recent precedent, with Mao Zedong the last leader to be granted such status on the front page after the party conclave - which is held once every five years. The People s Daily did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since Deng Xiaoping introduced collective leadership three decades ago to ward off the rise of another Mao-like cult of personality, the official portraits of all newly-selected Politburo Standing Committee members have been presented together on the front page in a grid.  The portrait of the party s top leader, the general secretary, is usually only slightly more prominent; reflecting his position as the first among equals.  Xi is the party s general secretary, chairman of the Central Military Commission, and president of the country. In Thursday s People s Daily, the portraits and biographical information of the six other standing committee members - Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng - were relegated to the inside pages.  That s definitely the first time since Mao,  said Ryan Manuel, a China expert at the University of Hong Kong, referring to Xi s oversized portrait on the front of the paper. The People s Daily is closely parsed by party cadres and others, and sets the tone for media coverage in state-run newspapers at the provincial level. Manuel said the paper closely followed regimented rules and norms and would have done so especially meticulously for its  most important front page in five years .  It s a strict system,  he said.  The rules of placement and the rules of what type of photos you put on there are incredibly tightly argued and defined.  Xi s status as China s most powerful leader since Mao was underlined on Wednesday when the party, in another break with precedent, revealed a new leadership line-up without naming an obvious successor to him. There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of the customary second five-year term in power, which ends in 2022. During the congress, Xi became the first leader since Mao to have a political ideology bearing his name enshrined in the party s constitution while in office. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
China's Xi meets military in first event since new leaders unveiled,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping met senior military leaders on Thursday and pressed them on his goal of having world class armed forces by the middle of the century, his first publicly announced meeting with them since a new leadership was unveiled. Xi, who is also head of the military and the ruling Communist Party, has made military modernisation a key policy platform, with advanced new equipment like stealth jets and aircraft carriers either already in service or development. The armed forces have also been a focus of Xi s fight against deep-seated corruption, with dozens of senior officials investigated and jailed. In his first publicly reported meeting with top officers since Wednesday s unveiling of his new Standing Committee, a seven-man body that is the height of power in China, Xi pushed home his modernisation message. The military must ensure it is a world-class service by 2050, Xi said, in comments carried by state media, a goal he set last week at the opening of a key party congress. The armed forces must  fully recognize the bright prospects for a strong military , Xi told them.  Put into practice one hundred percent military construction.  Though China has not fought a war in decades, it has been taking an increasingly assertive stance in the disputed East and South China Seas, as well as over self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, rattling nerves around the region. China says that it has only peaceful intentions, but that it needs a modern military to protect its interests and citizens around the world and that it will never compromise on China s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Failure to pass UK's Brexit bill would create legal holes: minister,"LONDON (Reuters) - Failure to pass the government s flagship piece of Brexit legislation through parliament will result in holes in the statute book and increased uncertainty, two junior British ministers said on Thursday.  This bill is about how we leave, it s about delivering certainty and continuity in the law as we leave the European Union,  said Steve baker, a minister in the Brexit department.  If this bill were not to pass ... then of course there would be holes in the statute book. The result would be that the statute book would not function as intended.

Red Cross says has access to Islamic State families held near Mosul,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Thursday it had access to more than 1,300 foreign wives and children of suspected Islamic State militants following concerns expressed for the safety of the families held by Iraqi forces near Mosul. The neutral aid agency called on all sides in the wars in Iraq and Syria to treat detainees in line with international law that prohibits torture or executions and enshrines the right to a fair trial. More than 300 of the detained foreign families in Iraq came from Turkey, many others from former Soviet states, such as Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Russia, according to preliminary figures from the Iraqi army.  Currently we visit and provide humanitarian assistance to some 1,300 women and children of several dozen nationalities who are detained in Iraq near Mosul,  Patrick Hamilton, ICRC deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, told a news briefing. Last month, foreign aid agencies in Iraq said they were  gravely concerned  about the fate of the families. The women and children have been in Iraqi custody since August 30 following the fall of the city of Tal Afar.  It is the largest group of foreigners linked to Islamic State to be held by Iraqi forces since they began driving the militants from Mosul and other areas in northern Iraq last year. The ICRC denounced some authorities and militias in the Iraq and Syria wars against Islamic State who have vowed to  annihiliate  the enemy, but declined to name names. Such  dehumanisation  of the enemy could lead to unlawful torture or executions, Hamilton warned.  Talk of annihilation or extermination contributes to perpetuating the problem rather than solving it.  International humanitarian law protects civilians and former combatants, he said. The ICRC has a  good level of dialogue  with Iraqi authorities and has visited detention facilities in Iraq holding 44,000 people so far this year, Hamilton said. Thousands of foreigners have been fighting for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and an unknown number of them are now detained. Hamilton said the ICRC was already in talks about potential repatriation of foreign fighters.  We are ready to play the role of a neutral intermediary to assist these states in carrying out that, the return of their individual citizens,  he said.  Indeed we have been in dialogue with a number of different states and the Iraqi authorities in relation to this over recent weeks, he said. Hamilton, asked about media reports of executions by U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) following the fall of the jihadist capital in Raqqa, Syria, said that an ICRC team had been in the  chaotic  northeastern city last week.  No, we frankly don t have first-hand information in regards to extrajudicial killings or any such like ... clearly we remain concerned in the aftermath of Raqqa as we do after Mosul, Hawija, Tal Afar and so forth,  he said.

Islamist militants 'taken out of action' in Mali: French military,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French military has targeted Islamist militants in northern Mali near the border with Algeria and took 15 militants  out of action , an armed forces spokesman said on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if the operation had any connection to the pursuit of assailants who killed four U.S. soldiers in an ambush on Oct. 4 in western Niger, about 400 kilometres to the south. The French operation in the region of Abeibara took place overnight on Monday and targeted members of Islamist militant group Ansar Dine, the spokesman said. It involved French Mirage jets, attack helicopters and forces on the ground, he added without providing details on how many of the 15 militants targeted had been killed or wounded.  France intervened in Mali to ward off an offensive by Islamist militants that began in 2012. Around 4,000 of its troops remain in the region as part of Operation Barkhane, where they work alongside around 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Mali. The U.S. deaths have drawn attention to counter-terror efforts in the arid Sahel region where an Islamist insurgency involving countless armed groups has been intensifying for years, regularly killing local soldiers.

Spanish markets rise on report of possible Catalan election,"LONDON (Reuters) - Spanish government bonds and stocks were in demand on Thursday after a media report said Catalonian President Carles Puigdemont was set to call a snap regional election for Dec. 20, a move that could ease tensions with Madrid.  Barcelona-based La Vanguardia said Puigdemont had taken the decision in a bid to persuade the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy not to enforce direct rule in the region. Puigdemont will make a statement at 1330 CET (1130 GMT), the regional government said.  This news is positive for Spain because it looks like Puigdemont is looking for ways other than declaring independence,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.   It sounds like he is calling these elections so that Madrid does not have to invoke article 155,  that would allow central government to suspend the wealthy region s autonomy. Spain s 10-year government bond yield - which moves inversely to price - fell 6 basis points to 1.58 percent on the news.  Spain s country stock index IBEX rose as much as 1.9 percent to a four-week high.  The gap between Spanish and German 10-year government bond yields   a keenly watched measure of market sentiment towards Spain   moved to its tightest in a month.  The spread between the two widened sharply earlier this month after Catalonia voted overwhelmingly in favor of breaking away from Spain, albeit on a low turnout, in an Oct. 1 referendum declared illegal by authorities in Madrid.

Japan business lobby throws weight behind PM Abe's wage hike plan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The head of Japan s largest business lobby on Thursday backed the prime minister s plan for companies to raise wages by 3 percent next year, boosting the chance that household spending will drive up consumer prices. Wages at big companies have been rising slightly more than 2 percent each year since 2014, government data shows, and an increase of 3 percent or more next year would help the Bank of Japan to reach its inflation target.  The business community realizes that society demands higher wages, so we want to take more aggressive steps to raise wages,  a government official quoted Sadayuki Sakakibara, chairman of the Keidanren business lobby, as telling a meeting of the government s top advisory panel. At the meeting, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe laid out a plan to encourage companies to raise wages and spend more money on capital expenditure with tax breaks. The push for higher wages is an important part of Abe s economic agenda, which has strong public support following his ruling coalition s comfortable victory in parliamentary elections on Oct. 22.

Iraqi PM Abadi demands Kurds cancel secession bid as price for talks,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq s prime minister demanded on Thursday that Kurds declare their independence referendum void, rejecting the Kurdish autonomous region s offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks.  We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the Constitution,  Haider al-Abadi said in a statement during a visit to Tehran. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) proposed on Wednesday an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and  starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution . The Kurds have been swiftly making concessions to Baghdad since last week, when Abadi sent his forces to seize all Kurdish-held territory outside of three autonomous provinces. A startlingly rapid advance by government troops transformed the balance of power in northern Iraq within a matter of days and has wrecked decades-old dreams of Kurdish independence that had come to a head last month with a referendum on secession.  Baghdad has always considered the Kurdish secession referendum illegal. Abadi s visit to Iran on Thursday follows a trip to Turkey on Wednesday, a diplomatic offensive that has shored up support from Iraq s neighbors for his hard line. Turkey s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday the Kurdish offer to suspend the push for independence was a step in the right direction but did not go far enough. Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory and has demanded central control of Iraq s border crossings with Turkey, including the oil export pipeline hub at Fish-Khabur, located just inside the Kurdish autonomous region. A media assistant to Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said Kurdish security forces, known as Peshmerga, had repelled three attacks by Iraqi forces, two in the direction of Fish-Khabur, and one in Perde, on the road linking Kirkuk to the KRG capital Erbil, destroying several tanks and armored vehicles. Iraqi authorities did not confirm this account of fighting. Both contested areas have important oil assets. The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is a close ally of both sides, arming and training both the Kurds and the central government s army to fight Islamic State. Iraq is one of the only countries in the world that is closely allied to both the United States and Iran, and Tehran has used the Kurdish separatism bid as a way to drive a wedge between Washington and Baghdad. Iran s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told Abadi in Tehran that he should not rely on the United States in the fight against Islamic State.  Unity was the most important factor in your gains against terrorists and their supporters,  Khamenei said, according to state TV.  Don t trust America ... It will harm you in the future.  Last week, Abadi spurned a call from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to send  home  Iranian-backed paramilitary fighters. Abadi s office called paramilitaries  patriots . The Kurdish crisis has broken out even as Iraq is about to finally defeat Islamic State, also known as ISIL, ISIS or Daesh, after a three-year war in which it received strong backing from a U.S.-led coalition, the Kurds and Iran. Iraqi forces launched an offensive on Thursday to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria.  Daesh members have to choose between death and surrender,  Abadi said in a statement announcing the offensive on region of al-Qaim and Rawa. Islamic State s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, in a grueling battle which lasted nine months. The militant group still holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under its control has rapidly shrunk there too, with its de facto Syrian capital falling to a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led force last week. Regular Iraqi army units, Sunni tribal forces and Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation are taking part in the offensive toward the Syrian border, Iraq s Joint Operations Command said.

"Syrian army captures Islamic State position, eyes final stronghold","BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army and its allies seized an oil pumping station in eastern Syria from Islamic State, paving the way for an advance towards the jihadists  last remaining Syrian stronghold, a Hezbollah-run news service reported on Thursday.  The  T2  pumping station is  considered a launch pad for the army and its allies to advance towards the town of Albu Kamal ... which is considered the last remaining stronghold of the Daesh organization in Syria , the report said. Albu Kamal is located in Deir al-Zor province at the Syrian border with Iraq, just over the frontier from the Iraqi town of al-Qaim. Iraq declared on Thursday the start of an offensive to capture al-Qaim and Rawa, the last patch of Iraqi territory still in IS hands. Islamic State s self-declared  caliphate  has crumbled this year with the fall of the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul. In Syria, the group is now mostly confined to a shrinking strip of territory in Deir al-Zor province. The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State is waging a separate campaign against the group in Deir al-Zor, focused on areas to the east of the Euphrates River which bisects the province. Albu Kamal is located on the western bank of the river. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Iraqi leader visits Iran as Tehran seeks to drive wedge with Washington,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told Iraq s U.S.-backed prime minister on Thursday that he should not rely on the United States in the fight against Islamic State, seeking to drive a wedge between Washington and one of its close allies.  Unity was the most important factor in your gains against terrorists and their supporters,  Khamenei told the visiting Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, according to state TV.  Don t trust America ... It will harm you in the future.  Iraq is one of the only countries in the world that is closely allied to both the United States and Iran. Both countries have armed and trained pro-government forces in Iraq in the battle against Islamic State militants. The United States, which installed the Shi ite-led government in Baghdad after toppling Saddam Hussein in 2003, now has 5,000 troops in Iraq and provides air support, training and weapons to the Iraqi army. Iran, the predominant Shi ite power in the Middle East, funds and trains Iraqi Shi ite paramilitaries known as Popular Mobilisation, which fight alongside government troops. For years, Baghdad has carefully avoided antagonising either Washington or Tehran. But a confrontation between the Iraqi central government and its Kurdish minority in recent weeks has threatened to tip the balance in Iran s favour. The Kurds are also funded and trained by Washington which has considered them allies for decades. After the Kurds staged a referendum on independence last month, Abadi responded by sending his troops to swiftly seize territory from Kurdish forces. This week, Abadi rebuked U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for demanding he send Iranian fighters in pro-government Shi ite militia  home . Abadi s office issued a statement saying no country should give orders to Iraq and calling the paramilitaries  patriots . He has since travelled to both Turkey and Iran to seek support for his hard line towards the Kurds. The Kurdish regional government proposed on Wednesday an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the result of last month s Kurdish independence vote and  starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution . The offer was rejected by Abadi s government, which said the independence referendum result must be annulled, rather than merely suspended, as a pre-condition to any talks.  We will preserve Iraq s unity and will never allow any secession,  Iran s state news agency IRNA quoted Abadi as saying during his meeting with Khamenei. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1

New Dutch government sworn in after record negotiations,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - King Willem-Alexander on Thursday swore in a new Dutch government under conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte, ending the longest coalition talks in Dutch history. Divisive elections on March 15 eroded the base of traditional parties, forcing the need to work out a deal between four parties.  Rutte s third cabinet since coming to power in 2010 will find support from the strongest Dutch economic growth in a decade, at over 3 percent, but only has a one-seat majority in both houses of parliament. Dissent by any parliament member could therefore endanger the coalition s plans.     Negotiations lasted 225 days as parties dug in over sensitive issues ranging from immigration and euthanasia to corporate tax rates. Under a detailed government accord reached earlier this month, broad tax cuts will benefit both companies and workers. This should boost the spending power of consumers, while making the euro zone s fifth largest economy more attractive for foreign investors. The coalition comprises Rutte s liberal VVD, the centrist D66 and conservative Christian parties CDA and Christian Union, marking a steer to the right compared to the outgoing government of VVD and the center-left Labour party. The installation of the new government marks the departure of Eurogroup president and finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who has said he will leave Dutch politics. Dijsselbloem will be succeeded by 42-year-old Christian Democrat Wopke Hoekstra, while the former parliamentary leader of the VVD, Halbe Zijlstra, will head the department of foreign affairs. Another notable newcomer is Sigrid Kaag, a well-known diplomat who since 2015 served as the Special Coordinator for Lebanon of the United Nations. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"Iraq launches final offensive on Islamic State, near Syrian border","(Reuters) - Iraqi forces launched on Thursday an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said.  Daesh members have to choose between death and surrender,  he said in a statement announcing the offensive on region of al-Qaim and Rawa. The Iraqi airforce dropped thousands of leaflets on the border area calling on the militants to surrender and urging the population to stay away from their positions, according to a statement from the Joint Operations Command in Baghdad. The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi ite militias backed by Iran and Russia. Islamic State s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, in a grueling battle which lasted nine months. The militants  Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces last week. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. He urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks.  Tell those among your children and relatives who took up a weapon against the state to throw it aside immediately, and to go to any house on top of which a white flag have been raised when the liberation forces enter al-Qaim,  said the leaflets dropped by the Iraqi airforce.

China says defense ties inject 'positive energy' into U.S. relations,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Military relations between China and the United States are a positive force in ties, and China wants to deepen mutual trust and cooperation, China s Defense Ministry said on Thursday ahead of a visit to Beijing by U.S. President Donald Trump. Both countries have worked hard to improve interaction between their militaries to avoid any miscalculations in areas like the South China Sea where both regularly fly military aircraft and sail warships. But there is deep mistrust, with Beijing having been angered by what it views as provocative U.S. military flights and naval patrols in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, and suspicious of close U.S. defense ties with South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and increasingly India. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation, something Beijing has opposed as an attempt by democracies to gang up on it. Speaking at a monthly news briefing, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said it was happy to see positive developments in military relations with the United States that both countries leaders attached importance to.  Looking to the future, we are willing to work with the U.S. side to respect each other, deepen mutual trust, focus on practical exchanges and cooperation and appropriately manage and control disputes, to continue injecting positive energy in the development of ties,  Ren added. China, a strategic rival to the United States and India, is also vital to Trump s efforts to roll back North Korea s efforts to create nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the United States, an issue expected to top the agenda in Trump s Nov. 8-10 Beijing visit.

Kenya's foreign debt investors take election turmoil calmly,"LONDON (Reuters) - While many Kenyans fear Thursday s election re-run will provoke serious trouble, foreign investors are cautiously confident that the country s debt can ride out the crisis, although they remain hesitant about local stocks. Their base scenario is that the vote can conclude largely smoothly. However, given that Kenya s external debt is rated B+ but trading at levels more akin to bonds with ratings two notches lower, this means assets have already adjusted to the uncertainty and any negative surprises may have less of an impact. And Nairobi s $1.5 billion stand-by facility deal with the International Monetary Fund provides additional comfort. East Africa s largest economy has slipped into turmoil since a Supreme Court ruling annulled the result of presidential elections in August. Matters worsened when opposition leader Raila Odinga quit the re-run against incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta.  In the very, very near term ... with the ruling we had in September, the period of uncertainty was extended to up until this point,  said Diana Amoa, portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management.  But the outlook going forward - once we get past this period - should be a positive one.  Police clashed with opposition supporters on Thursday and gangs of youths prevented voting in some towns. A handful of polling officials who pitched up to work in Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, cowered behind closed doors, unable to distribute any voting material. However, the government said the security situation was by and large  OK , with polling stations open in over 90 percent of the country. For funds active in Africa and across frontier markets - a sub-set of riskier, smaller developing countries - the $55 billion Kenyan economy has been a firm part of their portfolios. The country s $2.75 billion in dollar-denominated bonds  maturing in 2019 KE102895185= and 2024 KE102895240= form part of major emerging market debt benchmarks and frontier indexes .JPMEGDR .JPMNG.  Year-to-date, Kenyan dollar bonds .JPMEGKENR .JPMEGDKENR have chalked up solid returns of more than 12 percent compared with nearly 9 percent on the index .JPMEGR .JPMEGDR. However, the political stand-off has blunted economic growth in Kenya, which has been largely stable since the violence a decade ago.  Kenyan debt has still underperformed its peers, said Gabriele Foa, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He noted that yield premiums over U.S. debt had not narrowed as much as those on other sub-Saharan debt.  When you look at the spreads with Angola, Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia, that has been widening over this year,  said Foa, who has an  overweight  rating on Kenya s dollar bonds.  We saw a compression in line with the region, but Kenya is definitely lagging.   Still, investors are also upbeat on the local government bond market, worth 1,387 billion shillings ($13.4 billion). The Kenyan shilling has been broadly unshaken by the political events, softening just over 1 percent since the start of the year. Previous experience points towards the shilling bouncing back swiftly. When violence ripped through the country following the 2007 elections, the shilling fell about 15 percent against the dollar, but recovered to pre-vote levels within three months.  Any softness in the currency, coupled with low foreign positioning overall in those assets, made local debt attractive, said JPMorgan s Amoa. Investors in Kenya s $22.3 billion stock market have been more cautious. While the Nairobi Stock Exchange All Share Index .NASI has risen around 17 percent since the start of the year in dollar terms, the gains fall well short of the 30 percent jump across emerging equities .MSCIEF more broadly.   Foreign investors have been generally in wait-and-see mode with some net selling at the margin,  said Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Exotix Capital. The percentage of Nairobi-listed stocks owned by foreigners has edged down to 21 percent in 2017 from a peak of 22.5 percent in 2013. Yet those waiting on the sidelines may well be happy to return if and when the political impasse has been resolved.   Kenya is the great hope for investors in Africa as a non-commodity producing country, which has the potential to industrialize ahead of its peers, with money going into railways, roads and ports,  said Daniel Salter, head of equity strategy at Renaissance Capital.   It is a country that investors want to like, but what they don t like is the current uncertainty.  ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"Desperate for news, Rohingya refugees tune in to 'WhatsApp radio'","COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Sat in his hillside grocery shop in a Bangladesh refugee camp, Rohingya Muslim Momtaz-ul-Hoque takes a break to listen to an audio recording on his mobile phone, while children and passers-by gather round to hear the latest news from Myanmar.  I listen because I get some information on my motherland,  said Hoque, 30, as he plays a message on WhatsApp explaining the Myanmar government s proposals for repatriating refugees. Hoque has been in Bangladesh since an earlier bout of violence in Myanmar s Rakhine state in 1992, but the number of refugees in the camps has swelled dramatically to more than 800,000 in recent weeks, after a massive Myanmar military operation sent around 600,000 people fleeing across the border. Tens of thousands of exhausted refugees have arrived with little more than a sack of rice, a few pots and pans and a mobile phone powered by a cheap solar battery, and many are desperate for news of what is going on back home.   With few news sources in their own language and low levels of literacy, audio and video messages distributed on apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook and YouTube have become a community radio of sorts for the Muslim minority. Dozens of WhatsApp groups have sprung up to fill the information gap. Their offerings range from grainy footage of violence, to listings of the names and numbers of people missing in the chaos of the exodus, or even an explainer from educated Rohingya on how to adjust to life in the camps. At a shop selling cold drinks in the Leda refugee camp, two men played  WhatsApp news  through a loudspeaker.  Out of breath, a man narrated a scene purportedly from a village in Myanmar s Buthidaung region, according to Mohammed Zubair, a refugee who translated the broadcasts for Reuters.  They are surrounding the village. We are under attack from the military and the mogs...some people are seriously injured,  Zubair translates the speaker as saying, using a derogatory term common in Bangladesh to refer to ethnic Rakhine Buddhists.  I trust it 100 percent,  Zubair said of the information. Reuters was not able to verify the account. The WhatsApp groups tend to have hundreds of members, meaning that the spread of information depends on people passing on the news. Many of the listeners do not know who is sending the message or the trustworthiness of the broadcaster. Some said outdated or inaccurate reports were common.  In some cases, we got audio messages of villages burning in Myanmar, and when we contact people in those villages, there s nothing,  said one refugee inside a tea shop in Bangladesh sKutupalong camp. Other refugees said videos of violence claimed to have been filmed in villages in Myanmar turned out to be footage from other countries. Many also worry that the unregulated nature of WhatsApp groups increases opportunities for voices keen to push an agenda rather than share facts. Rohingya rebel group the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) - whose Aug. 25 attacks on security forces triggered the latest crisis - and its followers have been among the most active adopters of WhatsApp to spread their message. Audio messages urging support, updates on the latest military movements and official press releases dominate some groups. Several refugees in Bangladesh said they had no idea if the messages, often posted by people with phone numbers registered in the Middle East or other parts of Asia, were actually from ARSA members. Refugees also worry that Bangladeshi security forces want to monitor the broadcasts, and are looking in the camps for ARSA supporters. At the tea shop in Kutupalong camp, refugees have stopped listening to the broadcasts on loudspeakers during daylight hours, preferring to gather clandestinely at night instead.     Still, many Rohingyas say social media platforms  play a crucial role in keeping spirits up among the community.  The Rohingya people are not organized,  said Hoque, the grocer.  They cannot take out their frustration any other way, so this is a way of protesting.   ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"Driven by fear, Rohingyas keep fleeing Myanmar: Red Cross official","SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - The thousands of Rohingya Muslims thronging the desolate beach had no food or water, except what the Red Cross gives them, and there was no shelter from the tropical sun and rain, yet fear of  tomorrow  has persuaded them to abandon their homes. Fabrizio Carboni, the top International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) official in Myanmar, described the plight of some 5,OOO people who had made their way to the mouth of the Naf river that divides Buddhist Myanmar from Muslim Bangladesh. He said some had been there as long as a month, unable to afford to pay fishermen to take them to Bangladesh, where most of their fellow Rohingyas have fled to escape the ethnic violence that erupted in Myanmar s Rakhine state two months ago.   What I can just tell them is a beach is not a place where you live,  Carboni told Reuters on Thursday, a day after visiting this stretch on the frontline of an unfolding humanitarian crisis. Myanmar has blocked humanitarian agencies apart from Red Cross organisations from accessing the northern part of Rakhine state, where the conflict worsened after Rohingya militants attacked 30 security posts on Aug. 25.  Many of the 600,000 stateless Rohingya Muslims who have fled Myanmar say they were driven out by a brutal military counteroffensive. The United Nations has called it a campaign of  ethnic cleansing , and Myanmar soldiers have been accused of rape, killings and arson. Myanmar s de facto leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, has said the refugees can return, but thousands have continued to arrive in Bangladesh.  When you decide to leave everything and go it s because, rightly or not, you believe that tomorrow will be worse than today where you are staying,  Carboni told Reuters in Sittwe, the capital of Myanmar s Rakhine state.  The stranded people weighed up their access to basic services, intercommunal relations and security before deciding to flee, he said.  Probably it s a lack of trust for the future where they are. I don t think we are in a moment now where there s a specific event triggering movement. We are in another phase,  he added. The Red Cross, which has about 200 personnel working in northern Rakhine, provided plastic sheets, food and water to the people on the beach.  Prior to the attacks on security posts in August, several groups had hundreds of staff and volunteers working in the area, but the government has restricted the movement of aid workers after accusing some groups of aiding Rohingya militants. Ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who accuse aid groups of favoring Muslims, on Wednesday blocked Relief International staff from visiting a camp for Muslims displaced in earlier violence. Protesters threw petrol bombs to try to block a Red Cross aid shipment in an incident on Sept. 20. Carboni said the Red Cross organisations could not be the only ones working in northern Rakhine  for the long run , but said their ability to reach people was ramping up. Food had reached 40,000 people by Monday, and at least 5,000 households would get food in the next week, he said.  In our dialogue with the government, we were always very clear, saying we will do our best and more to reach as many people as possible,  said Carboni.   Now there is a need for the government to re-engage with the rest of the humanitarian community, and find an acceptable way for the people to receive the assistance they need.

"In abandoned Philippine city, first hints of a return to normalcy","MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - After five months of crippling conflict, there are slow signs of life returning in the Philippines  battered Marawi City. Utilities engineers were at work on Thursday in the near-deserted outskirts of Marawi which escaped the daily air strikes that flattened vast swathes of the city. A few groceries, motorcycle repair shops and gasoline sellers have opened, ready for the first batch of returning residents in the coming days. Nearly 6,500 families will be headed back to the homes that were left intact, out of the 353,000 people displaced when hundreds of pro-Islamic State gunmen ran amok and seized control of central Marawi in May. Combat operations ended on Monday, when the last fighters were killed in a fierce final stand. With vehicles crushed and overturned and buildings reduced to skeletons of mangled steel and rubble, the city appears to be in the aftermath of a war that lasted years, rather than months. Amelah Ampaso said she decided that day to sneak back to Marawi and reopen her shop, now stocked with cooking oil and cigarettes and offering photocopying services, printing, and haircuts. As a first-mover in a liberated Marawi, the 25-year-old is doing brisk business among the few people around.  The other shops are closed, so people are coming here,  she said.  It s safe again.  But nearby streets look like the set of a post-apocalyptic film, silent, with shutters pulled down and weeds growing between concrete slabs. Rust and decay is setting in after months of heavy rains and neglect. Spray painted on the walls of almost every building is the word  clear , marking where police and soldiers went house-to-house checking thousands of abandoned properties for booby-traps or signs of insurgents hiding. The fighting has taken a heavy toll, killing more than 1,100 people, mostly militants, and reducing a large part of the interior of the city to piles of rubble, leaving only shells of uninhabitable gray buildings. Shop owner Madid Noor, 64, returned two months into the battle, reassured by detachments of soldiers and police nearby, and unperturbed by what were constant explosions and the howling of fighter jets over the city. After a few lean months, he hopes returnees will come to him to buy washing powder, petrol and fake branded sportswear.  Some days we have customers. But not every day,  he said.

"No deal: bridge is not a sport, EU rules","LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Bridge is not a sport, the European Union s top court ruled on Thursday, thwarting a gambit by a British players to avoid sales tax on the grounds that sitting around playing cards is not a physical activity.

An EU directive lets governments waive VAT on some services  closely linked to sport or physical education . However, the European Court of Justice found that despite the contention that competitive bridge promotes physical and mental health, the definition of  sport  for purposes of the tax directive must include a  not negligible physical element .

Myanmar's Rohingya exodus: A desperate escape,"(Reuters) - The world s fastest-growing humanitarian crisis shows no signs of abating, two months after militant attacks triggered a military crackdown in Myanmar s Rakhine State.   This week thousands of new Rohingya Muslim refugees crossed the border into neighboring Bangladesh, fleeing hunger and a campaign of attacks by Myanmar security forces and Buddhist mobs that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing. Exhausted, hungry and destitute, they join more than 600,000 who earlier fled what the military has called  clearance operations  in Rohingya villages after the Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants. They have crossed land borders, rivers and treacherous seas to seek refuge in crowded camps in Bangladesh, itself a poor country struggling, along with international aid agencies, to cope with the influx.

Taiwan president calls for breakthrough in China relations,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan and China need to drop historical baggage to seek a breakthrough in relations, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in her first public comments since China s ruling Communist Party unveiled a new leadership line-up. Relations nose-dived after Tsai, who leads the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year, with China suspecting that she wants to push for the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Beijing has suspended a regular dialogue mechanism with Taipei established under Taiwan s previous, China-friendly government, and there has been a dramatic fall in the number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan under Tsai s administration.  Right now is a turning point for change. I once again call on leaders of both sides to ... seek a breakthrough in cross-straits relations and to benefit the long-term welfare of people on both sides and to forever eliminate hostilities and conflict,  Tsai told a forum.  While acknowledging the changes in China s leadership announced on Wednesday, Tsai did not comment specifically on the composition of Xi s core team. But she reiterated that while the island s goodwill towards China would not change, Taipei would not submit to pressure. Responding to Tsai s speech, China s Taiwan Affairs Office said the political basis for relations across the Taiwan Strait was the  one China  principle, which states that the mainland and Taiwan are part of one China. As long as that is recognized, there are no obstacles to any talks between the sides, the office said in a statement carried by state media. China has been stepping up the pressure on Taiwan. This year, China s air force has carried out several rounds of drills near Taiwan, prompting the island s air force to scramble fighters. Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said Taiwan was a part of China and the military exercises would continue as normal, adding that China was sincere in seeking  peaceful reunification .  At the same time, we have the ability, confidence and means to protect the country s unity, sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,  he told a monthly news conference in Beijing later in the day. Chinese President Xi Jinping drew strong applause at last week s start of the Communist Party Congress when he said any attempt to separate Taiwan from China would be thwarted.  Taipei s Mainland Affairs Council delivered a swift response, saying it was  absolutely  the right of Taiwan s 23 million people to decide their future. China regards self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as a wayward province, to be brought under Beijing s rule by force if necessary. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
North Korea's Kim congratulates China's Xi after congress,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a rare congratulatory message to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday at the end of China s Communist Party Congress, wishing him  great success  as head of the nation, the North s state media said. The friendly gesture by the North Korean leader, who seldom issues personal messages, comes as China is being urged by the international community to do more to rein in the North s missile and nuclear tests that have raised tensions globally. Xi became China s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong at the all-important week-long congress.  It expressed the conviction that the relations between the two parties and the two countries would develop in the interests of the peoples of the two countries,  the North s state-run central news agency said in a statement on Thursday, citing the message sent by Kim to Xi.  The Chinese people have entered the road of building socialism with the Chinese characteristics in the new era  under the guidance of Xi, the message said. The two countries often exchange routine diplomatic correspondence and ceremonial letters to each other on political anniversaries or political promotions, although personal messages to and from the leaders tend to be few. Analysts said it was too early to tell whether or not ties between the two countries were warming up.  Congratulatory messages between North Korea and China are an old story and reading too much into the message exchanged would be a one-sided analysis,  said Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.   It s what they usually do and not surprising at all.  China is the North s sole major ally, and accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country.  Beijing has been called upon by several countries, especially the United States, to step up its efforts to curb North Korea s ambitions towards building a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile that can reach the United States. It has shown it is irritated with Pyongyang following the isolated state s numerous missile launches and nuclear tests, repeatedly calling for restraint and urging all sides to speak and act carefully. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing on Thursday that China had received  congratulatory messages from many countries and parties, including one from North Korea.  China and North Korea are close neighbors and have a tradition of friendly contact,  he said, without elaborating.  China has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of North Korean coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. North Korea has not engaged in any missile or nuclear provocations since mid-September, although it tends to test fewer missiles late in the year for unexplained reasons.  North Korea has been walking a diplomatic tightrope by taking advantage of strategic mistrust between China and Russia, but it has not been easy as Beijing has sternly responded to its nuclear and missile provocations,  said Kim Han-kwon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul.   China s party congress is over, but Kim Jong Un s concerns will only continue to deepen. The most significant event at hand is the upcoming summit between Xi and (U.S. President Donald) Trump,  said Kim. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1

"Fugitives in Kim Jong Nam killing changed clothes at airport, witness says","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Four men suspected of killing the North Korean leader s half-brother at a Malaysian airport changed their clothes and appearance to escape detection, a police witness said on Thursday.  The four, who are still at large, are charged together with two women - Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam - with killing Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur airport s budget terminal on Feb. 13. Prosecutors in the Malaysian court say Siti Aisyah and Huong conspired with the men to murder Kim, by smearing his face with liquid VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations. Defense lawyers have argued the women did not know they were handling poison and thought they were involved in a prank for a reality TV show.    The men had been formerly identified only as Mr. Chang, Mr. Y, James, and Hanamori, also known as Grandpa  or  Uncle , which a police witness has said were assumed names. The men changed clothes after the attack, before they were seen leaving the airport, police investigator Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz told the court.   They were trying to confuse (observers),  Wan Azirul said, describing closed-circuit television recordings made on the day of the killing.  More than 40 CCTV video clips of the men s movements at the airport were screened in the darkened courtroom.      They showed Mr. Chang and Mr. Y heading to different bathrooms in the airport before emerging in different clothes, shortly after the attack on Kim Jong Nam.  Mr. Chang, who had earlier been seen wearing a goatee, also came out of the bathroom clean-shaven.  All of the suspects at large, even though they changed clothes, did not change their shoes,  added Wan Azirul, who said the shoes were among the features enabling identification of the suspects, besides their body types and movements.  Other videos showed Mr. Chang and Mr. Y meeting separately with a man, identified as Hanamori, at a restaurant near the airport s check-in counters, prior to the attack. Hanamori was seen arriving at the restaurant with a fourth man, who Wan Azirul said was suspected to be James . Mr. Chang later met alone with Siti Aisyah at the restaurant, while Mr. Y was seen walking past the restaurant with Huong. It is unclear whether the four suspects at large were the same four North Koreans authorities described as having left Kuala Lumpur for Pyongyang on the day of the killing.  An Interpol alert has been issued for the four who left, identified as North Koreans Ri Ji Hyon, Hong Song Hac, O Jong Gil, and Ri Jae Nam.      U.S. and South Korean officials have said agents of Kim Jong Un s regime masterminded the murder. The trial will resume on Nov 6. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
"'A difficult life': As refugee arrivals to Greece pick up, misery grows","SAMOS, Greece(Reuters) - Even on the nights Muhammad Ahlum s children manage to fall asleep, they wake up screaming.  Since Ahlum and his family fled Syria s civil war five months ago, they have been living in a grim and congested camp on the Greek island of Samos. Like other asylum-seekers in limbo in Greece, they are barely coping. More than 14,500 asylum-seekers, mostly Syrians and Iraqis, are in five camps on Greek islands close to Turkey. Aid groups have warned a mental health emergency is developing, fueled by poor living conditions, neglect and violence. Arrivals to Greece from Turkey had all but stopped after the European Union struck a deal with Ankara last year. But asylum procedures can take months, and a small, steady flow had continued. A recent sharp rise is straining facilities.   I am very depressed. My wife is sick,  said Ahlum, 36, recounting how his children, aged six and eight, have stopped eating food in the camp and are terrified of noises.  This is my life in the camp. A very difficult life,  he said.  Sometimes they can t sleep at night. Sometimes they wake up screaming and crying.  Over a dozen human rights groups wrote to the Greek prime minister on Monday urging him to end the  containment  of asylum seekers on the islands, where camps hold two to three times as many people as they were designed for.  In the last two months, there has been a significant increase in people talking about suicide as a way to escape from this situation,  said Jayne Grimes, manager of mental health activities on Samos for Doctors Without Borders. More than 2,500 asylum-seekers are on Samos, in facilities for 700. Hundreds have set up tents in the surrounding forest.  If we knew it would be like this, we would have stayed under the bombing,  said Syrian Muahab Ashaad, 27, as he sat with his son in their tent under the trees. The government has said it plans to move 2,000 asylum-seekers from Samos and nearby Lesbos to the mainland, where about 50,000 more refugees and migrants live in camps. Aid organizations say it may not enough.  The most urgent need is to prepare for the winter, not only for the cold but for the rains,  said Rose de Jong, Samos field officer for the United Nations refugee agency. Locals on Samos, just a few miles from Turkish shores, are divided. Some say the island can t cope with the sheer numbers.  The situation has become unbearable,  said Athanasios Terzis, a businessman.  We don t have anything against them. We just want them to leave and to be taken to the rest of Greece.

Israel willing to resort to military action to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons: minister,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Israel is willing to resort to military action to ensure Iran never acquires nuclear weapons, the intelligence minister said on Thursday in Japan where he is seeking backing for U.S. President Donald Trump s tougher line on Tehran. Trump said on Oct. 13 he would not certify Iran is complying with an agreement on curtailing its nuclear program, signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, opening a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose sanctions.  If international efforts led these days by U.S. President Trump don t help stop Iran attaining nuclear capabilities, Israel will act militarily by itself,  Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said in an interview in Tokyo.  There are changes that can be made (to the agreement) to ensure that they will never have the ability to have a nuclear weapon.  Israel has taken unilateral action in the past without the consent of its major ally, the United States, including air strikes on a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria in 2007 and in Iraq in 1981. A strike against Iran, however, would be a risky venture with the potential to provoke a counter strike and roil financial markets. An Israeli threat of military strikes could, nonetheless, galvanize support in the United States for toughening up the nuclear agreement but it could also backfire by encouraging hardliners in Iran and widening a rift between Washington and European allies. So far, none of the other signatories to the deal - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, Iran and the European Union - has cited serious concerns, leaving the United States isolated. Japan relies on the U.S. military to help defend it against threats from North Korea and elsewhere. Tokyo s diplomatic strategy in the Middle East, where it buys almost all its oil, is to maintain friendly relations with all countries, including Iran.   I asked the Japanese government to support steps led by President Trump to change the nuclear agreement,  said Katz, who is a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s right-wing Likud party.  The question of whether Japanese companies will begin to work in Iran or not is a very important question.  Katz s visit to Tokyo comes ahead of a planned trip by Trump from Nov. 5 for a summit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Officials at Japan s Ministry of Foreign Affairs were not immediately available to comment. Israel, Katz said, wants the nuclear agreement to be revised to remove an expiration date, and to impose tighter conditions to stop Tehran from developing new centrifuges used to make weapons-grade nuclear material.  He also urged sanctions to stop Iran from establishing  Syria as a military base to launch attacks on Israel and action to put a halt to Tehran s development of ballistic missiles.  We will not allow Iran to transform Syria into forward base sea harbors, air bases and Shia militias,  he said.  We will act together with the United States and other countries in the world until they stop the ballistic missiles that threaten Israel.   The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday backed new sanctions on Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia.  ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Fear of Iranian general left Iraqi Kurdish oil fields deserted,"BAGHDAD/LONDON (Reuters) - When the Iraqi army and Iranian-backed Shi ite militia entered a key oil processing facility in Iraq s north to retake it from Kurdish Peshmerga forces last week, the installation was deserted and its alarm bells ringing. Engineers and workers on the facility, which processes oil from two major fields in the Kirkuk area of predominantly Sunni Kurdistan, had fled, fearing the military advance.  No one wanted to risk their life and decided to evacuate as stories about the Shi ite militia and Qassem Soleimani were spreading fast,  said a senior Kurdish oil industry source, referring to the head of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards. The source declined to be identified. Iraqi engineers arrived to the sound of alarm bells warning about system malfunctions, prompting them to immediately shut down wells. Now, they need passwords and expertise from their Kurdish counterparts to restore oil output fully.  The loss of control of Kirkuk oil fields is likely to starve the KRG of vital oil revenue and cause deep concern to global trading houses such as Vitol and Glencore, which have granted the semi-autonomous government billions of dollars in loans against future oil sales. Baghdad s lightning military offensive into northern Iraq came after the Kurdistan Regional Government held an independence referendum last month. Major-General Soleimani, one of the most influential military figures in the Middle East, with reach in Syria and Lebanon, issued tough warnings to Kurdish leaders ahead of the Iraqi military advance.  We went inside the oilfield facilities after Kurdish workers fled and we found overalls and safety boots thrown on the ground,  said an engineer from the Baghdad-run North Oil Company, who declined to be named because he was ordered not to speak publicly about the issue.   It seems that workers took them off and escaped very quickly.   NOC crews entered oil facilities in the Bai Hassan and Avana fields on Oct. 17 for the first time since 2014, when Peshmerga forces drove Islamic State from the area and found all crude oil stations unmanned. Peshmerga fighters had also withdrawn.  After we discovered that some of the key equipment was missing and the control panel was ringing alarms of crude processing malfunction, we immediately shut down oil wells,  the NOC engineer said. A week after the operation, Iraqi engineers are still struggling to resume Kirkuk s oil production, saying they had yet to understand how to operate the equipment processing some 350,000 barrels per day. The military offensive more than halved Kurdistan s oil output and cut its exports to global markets via Turkey by two thirds.  The drop in exports has deprived the region of more than $200 million in revenues over the past week, a Kurdish oil industry source familiar with loadings told Reuters. It has also dealt a further blow to the region s finances already stretched by a fight against Islamic State and a budget crisis caused by a fall in oil prices. The United States has called on both sides to resume dialogue, saying the tensions hamper efforts to fight Islamic State. Resuming normal oil production and exports will be challenging and will take at least another week and will only succeed if Iraqi and Kurdish engineers agree to cooperate, according to both sides. On Tuesday, NOC officials asked Kurdish engineering firm Kar Group to send back its workers, according to sources on both sides. Iraqi engineers need guidance on how to operate recently installed equipment at Bai Hassan and Avana, the sources said. The pumping and operational stations for both oil fields are located in the city of Dahuk, which unlike Kirkuk is still under the control of the Peshmerga forces.  Energy facilities in Kirkuk are more like a locked box and only their crew have the password,  the Iraqi engineer said. Kar Group has, however, so far refrained from going back without security guarantees, according to sources close to the engineering company. Kirkuk, one of the oldest and best known oil areas in the Middle East, had long been under the control of Iraqi forces until it was over-run by Islamic State. In 2014, it was retaken by the Peshmerga, the official security forces of the KRG, as part of their advance on Islamic State. That allowed Kurdistan to regain control of an area it believes is historically Kurdish and ramp up exports from the oil fields while borrowing billions of dollars from trading houses and Russian state oil major Rosneft.  We need to figure out who gets what when the fields resume production. At the moment the potential split of revenues is far from clear,  said the Kurdish oil industry source. Before the referendum, Kurdistan was exporting some 600,000 bpd of crude via Turkey, which it said had made it almost totally economically independent as it could pay its own bills without the need to wait for budget transfers from Baghdad. Under the deal with Baghdad, Kurdistan was exporting 540,000 bpd on behalf of the government in the city of Erbil and some 60,000 bpd on behalf of NOC. With the loss of control of the Kirkuk area, Kurdistan will be in theory left with only 250,000-300,000 bpd of its own output, less than it needs to cover its debt obligations. Vitol, Glencore, Petraco and Trafigura have loaned Kurdistan some $2.5 billion and Russia s Rosneft has loaned some $1.2 billion. Glencore s boss Ivan Glasenberg said last week he could not rule out a rescheduling of the payments. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Women fail to crack China's glass ceiling as party picks new leaders," (This October 25 story has been corrected to change pronoun to  he  from  she  to correct gender of quoted delegate in final paragraph) By John Ruwitch BEIJING (Reuters) - Every time China s ruling Communist Party convenes a major gathering, like the congress that just ended in Beijing, the list of delegates is hand-crafted in part to burnish the party s image as  representative of the masses  - including giving some prominence to those in more menial jobs and ethnic minorities. Yet one group is chronically under-represented among the political elite: women. The founding father of communist China, Mao Zedong, may have once said that women  hold up half the sky  but when the twice-a-decade party congress selected a new batch of top leaders this week, females weren t holding up much at all. No women made it onto the elite Politburo Standing Committee, the group of seven men at the pinnacle of the party. None ever have. In the new Politburo, only one of its 25 members is a woman   Sun Chunlan, head of the party body charged with outreach to non-Communists. It is her second term and she is likely to retire in five years. On the previous Politburo, there were two women, Sun and Vice Premier Liu Yandong - who is past retirement age and has stepped down from the Politburo. One rung down, just 4.9 percent of the new Central Committee, a mere 10 of the body s 204 members, are women. That number was unchanged from the outgoing Central Committee, which presided for five years, but lower than in 2007-2012 when there were 13. The State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party s propaganda department, did not respond to faxed questions for comment on why there are so few women in senior party positions. By way of comparison, five members of U.S. President Donald Trump s 24-member cabinet are women, and about 20 percent of the U.S. Congress are female. In Japan, two out of 20 members of the cabinet are women as are about 10 percent of the lower house lawmakers newly elected on Sunday. At the Chinese party congress itself, the overall numbers were stronger: about a quarter of its 2,287 delegates were women - roughly commensurate with the proportion in the roughly 90 million-member party. But with most senior leadership posts in the hands of men, activist Xiong Jing, an NGO project manager who edits a feminist social media site, said many of the women delegates to the party congress were there merely as  decoration .  This problem is a clich ,  she said.  With the political system as it is now, I think even if more women were involved, whether as party congress delegates or in government, they may be very limited in what they can do.  The party takes the appearance of representativeness seriously when it comes to some groups. At party congresses and annual sessions of parliament, there are delegates from China s 56 different ethnic groups, every branch of the military and police, private businesses, the state sector and, of course, the government. The party congress this year featured delegates who were astronauts, athletes, actors, judges, farmers and more. There was even a delegate representing housekeepers, who showed up in her apron and maid s cap. For women in general in China, political empowerment is lacking. China ranked 74th in political empowerment of women out of 144 countries in the World Economic Forum s global Gender Gap Report last year. In 2006, it was no. 52 out of 115. Leta Hong Fincher, a New York-based sociologist and author of the forthcoming book  Betraying Big Brother: The Rise of China s Feminist Resistance , says women in China are losing ground amid a resurgence of traditional gender norms.  It s my impression that the Communist Party is fundamentally not interested in having women at the senior levels at all,  she said. In China s pre-reform command economy under Mao, women were drafted into the workforce and recruited into nation-building. The most powerful woman since the communist takeover in 1949 was Mao s third wife, Jiang Qing. She and members of her  Gang of Four  were arrested after Mao s death in 1976 and blamed for the excesses of the chaotic Cultural Revolution. More recently, Hong Fincher says, the party has been spooked by China s demographic challenges - an aging population, shrinking labor force and falling birth rates - and has aggressively promoted the idea that women should be getting married and having babies. To be sure, in Chinese business there are some prominent female chief executives, such as Zhang Xin at real estate developer Soho China and Zhou Qunfei, the billionaire founder of Lens Technology. And the party and government pay lip service to gender equality. The state constitution guarantees women the same rights as men.  The government ... wants to appear to be taking gender equality seriously, when in reality it is not. It is actually in full retreat with regard to gender equality,  Hong Fincher said. The election process for party congress delegates is tightly controlled, with candidates vetted for their loyalty to the party and leadership. But congress delegate Tang Jialing, who is a crew member on a deep-sea research submersible, suggested that the lack of women reflected the will of the people.  We are the party of the people. It s the people who voted in more men than women. It s the people s choice,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"China says foreign press welcome, as some media outlets excluded from key event","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday told foreign journalists to roam the country and report more, even as five global news organisations found themselves without invitations to cover his speech.  The BBC, The Economist, The Financial Times, The Guardian and The New York Times were not invited to the event where Xi introduced his new leadership line-up following a once-in-five-years Communist Party Congress, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China (FCCC) said.  Two Reuters journalists were invited.  We encourage reporters to travel and see more of China... to learn about and continue to report on more aspects of China,  Xi told a gathering of Chinese and international journalists. He did not take questions.  We do not need lavish praise from others. However, we do welcome objective reporting and constructive suggestions.  Under Xi, China has stepped up censorship and tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society. Reporting conditions for foreign journalists in China have deteriorated in recent years, according to media watchdog groups, with areas of the country including Tibet effectively off-limits.  The FCCC criticized the exclusion of the Western news organisations.   It is hard to avoid the conclusion that these media organisations have been singled out to send a message,  the FCCC said in a statement posted on Twitter.  Using media access as a tool to punish journalists whose coverage the Chinese authorities disapprove of is a gross violation of the principles of press freedom.  The Beijing bureau chiefs at the Economist and Financial Times both confirmed to Reuters that they had not received invitations. The New York Times had applied for and not received an invitation, a spokesperson said in an email.  We are disappointed that we were denied access to President Xi s press conference. The BBC will continue to report fairly and objectively on the stories of China,  the BBC said in a statement. The Guardian published a story saying it was among those organisations excluded. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang referred specific questions about the congress to the press center but said foreign reporters were welcome to cover the gathering.  We handle foreign reporter applications according to rules and regulations,  he told reporters. An official at the press center told Reuters that it had organized many events that foreign media could and did attend. The Standing Committee unveiling venue had limited space and so there was no guarantee all foreign media who applied could attend, the official said.   We hope that foreign media can really pay attention to China s development and objectively and fairly report on China and the Communist Party,  said the official, who asked not be named. There were more than 3,000 reporters covering the congress, according to state media, and the leadership announcement was held in a side room at Beijing s Great Hall of the People, not in the cavernous main auditorium.

"On Shanghai outskirts, some residents unmoved as China unveils leadership","FENGXIAN, China (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke to the country on Wednesday about  waves of positive energy  from the ruling Communist Party after its twice-a-decade leadership shuffle, but on the rural outskirts of Shanghai, not everyone was riveted to the screen. As the party congress drew to a close and Xi prepared to unveil a new leadership team during the national broadcast, some elderly residents gathering for lunch in the sleepy suburb of Fengxian expressed indifference. An 85-year-old man with a shock of white hair, who identified himself by the surname Cai, said he would not watch.   Whatever happens today, I don t care,  he said with a smile.   I m a Christian and I go to worship after lunch, and I will be late if I watch. I am not cultured. I don t understand what they are saying.            Gathering in a crowded two-storey compound with dusty concrete floors and solid wooden furniture heaving with fruit and snacks, Fei Jinxian, another 85-year-old Fengxian resident, said she was unclear of the significance of Wednesday s events. Watching the broadcast, Fei and her friends nodded appreciatively when Xi emerged on to the stage, but she said she barely recognized any of the other figures appointed to the Politburo Standing Committee, including Premier Li Keqiang.  I recognize Xi Jinping, and I recognize Han Zheng because he is from our city, but the others I don t know about,  Fei said in the local dialect. As a Chinese television commentator reflected on the  historical importance of this moment , 58-year-old Gu Wenfeng said she did not understand.   I don t normally pay much attention to politics,  she said.    I only watch it if my son is around and he puts it on.  Xi has emerged as China s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong after a congress that enshrined his own political theory into the constitution. Xi told the gathering of Chinese and international reporters and a TV audience of millions about the  great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation  and the  waves of positive energy  from the ruling Communist Party, but people in Fengxian were more concerned about local matters.  Fengxian has seen its population decline as its youth head into the cities for fresh opportunities and better wages, but rapid urbanization and a campaign to build a  new socialist countryside  through government infrastructure spending has transformed the area.   The leaders have been paying a lot of attention with the waterways, roads and whatnot,  said Gu, pointing to a new drainage channel running through the village.  I think the next five years are going to get better.  Shen Bo, a 31-year-old grassroots Communist Party official in Fengxian, told Reuters that he was unfamiliar with most of the new leadership line-up, but said he was proud of the  powerful  President Xi, who had a  feeling for the times  and remained in touch with China s rural heartlands.  I can use three characters to describe him,  he said, using characters that mean  touching the ground , or  down to earth .   Because he has studied the grassroots more, and that is my strongest impression of him.   ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1

Iraqi PM Abadi insists outcome of Kurdish independence referendum be canceled,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq s prime minister insisted on Thursday that the Kurdish independence referendum be declared void, an apparent rejection of the Kurdistan region s offer to  freeze  its independence push as part of efforts to resolve the crisis through talks.  We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the Constitution,  Haider al-Abadi said in a statement . The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) proposed on Wednesday an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and  starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution . Baghdad has always considered the Kurdish secession referendum illegal. It responded last week by seizing back the city of Kirkuk, the oil-producing areas around it and other territory that the Kurds had captured from militant group Islamic State. Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory and has demanded central control of Iraq s border crossings with Turkey, at Fish-Khabur, located inside the Kurdish autonomous region. Fish-Khabur is strategically vital because oil from both Kurdish and government-held parts of northern Iraq crosses via a pipeline there into Turkey, the main route out of the area for the exports that are crucial to any Kurdish independence bid. The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is a close ally of both sides, arming and training both the Kurds and the central government s army to fight Islamic State.

Pakistani court issues arrest warrant for ex-PM Sharif: media,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani court issued an arrest warrant for ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after he failed to appear before the court over anti-corruption allegations, local media said on Thursday, but he can avoid arrest by paying bail. In Pakistan,  bailable arrest warrants  often act as a warning to deter absences from court, but a judge can later issue non-bailable warrants that are more serious and could see Sharif arrested when he returns to Pakistan. Sharif missed the hearing as he is undertaking a religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, Dawn and other English-language newspapers reported. Sharif had spent previous weeks tending to his wife in London, where she is receiving cancer treatment. Sharif faces three separate corruption charges from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), an anti-corruption body which has its own courts. Sharif s two sons and his daughter Maryam, who is viewed as Sharif s heir-apparent, are also facing NAB trials. Sharif, 67, resigned in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding office over an undeclared source of income, but the veteran leader maintains his grip on the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. The Sharifs have called the corruption proceedings against them a conspiracy, hinting at intervention by the powerful military, but opponents have hailed it as a rare example of the rich and powerful being held accountable. The army denies playing a role.  We are going through a time in Pakistan where speaking up against injustice is called contempt of court and speaking up for the nation is called treason, but I still believe that we will be victorious,  Maryam said outside the court, according to Dawn newspaper. Sharif had a representative in court. Sharif s disqualification stemmed from the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy flats in London. The NAB court charges against Sharif relate to the ownership of London apartments, as well as establishment of two large-scale factory businesses in Saudi Arabia. Sharifs deny any wrongdoing on all charges. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1
Turkey to detain 121 ex-foreign ministry staff over Gulen links: media,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police began an operation to detain 121 former foreign ministry staff across the country on Thursday over their alleged links to the U.S.-based cleric who Ankara says orchestrated last year s attempted coup, state-run Anadolu agency said. It said the ministry personnel were previously dismissed over suspected ties to Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. He has denied involvement in the failed putsch in July 2016. Counter-terrorism police squads began simultaneous raids in 30 provinces to capture the suspects, some of whom were believed to be users of ByLock, an encrypted messaging app which the government says was used by Gulen s network, Anadolu reported. Under a crackdown since the coup, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to Gulen, while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military, public and private sectors. The government dismisses rights groups  concerns about the crackdown, saying only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by Gulen s network, which it says infiltrated institutions such as the judiciary, army and schools.

NZ Prime Minister heads to trade talks with foreign investment ban on her mind,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Thursday she will seek to renegotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement in Vietnam in two weeks  time to allow the government to ban foreign speculators buying New Zealand existing homes. Ardern, who was sworn in on Thursday after negotiating a Labour-led coalition after a tight election result, said she had already started work on the restrictions.  Whether it s TPP or any other agreement it s making sure we have the ability to ban foreign buyers from buying existing homes in New Zealand,  Ardern told reporters in Wellington. The 11 TPP members had set a goal of reaching broad agreement on the pact in November at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting set to be held in Vietnam s Danang. New Zealand previously touted itself as a champion of free trade and was a key backer of the TPP since the United States withdrew in January, but Labour has expressed concern TPP would stop it from banning foreigners from buying existing homes. Foreign investors can still buy new houses and apartments. The policy is designed to combat a politically sensitive housing crunch that has priced many New Zealanders out of the market, with prices up more than 50 percent nationally in the last decade. In the city of Auckland, prices have almost doubled in that period. New Zealand was the sixth most popular market for Chinese investors, down from fifth last year, said Jane Lu, head of Australia and New Zealand for international property website Juwai.com. She said foreign buyers tended to fast-forward plans to purchase overseas when new restrictions or taxes loomed. While voters have taken to their charismatic 37-year-old leader, traders have been less impressed with the government s planned protectionist policies and coalition government. The currency had fallen to $0.6861 on Wednesday, its lowest level since May, having plummeted more than 6 percent since the Sept. 23 election. The Kiwi last stood at $0.6878. Veteran protectionist politician Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First which holds the balance of power, delivered a victory to Labour after the 23 Sept. election failed to result in a majority for Labour or National. Peters last year described a Chinese company taking a majority ownership in a small New Zealand dairy processor as  lunacy , while he called dairy giant Fonterra s decision to send cows to China  economic treason . His policies have consistently centered around tight controls on immigration and foreign investment. As well as renegotiating the TPP, Ardern said on Thursday that immigration numbers would be cut by up to 30,000 from record levels of over 70,000. Any trade and foreign ownership restrictions could hurt New Zealand s reputation as an open economy and antagonize the likes of China. Trade between the two countries has grown to more than NZ$20 billion ($14.4 billion) a year, and Chinese President Xi Jinping called the relationship  unprecedented  in its depth.

Turkish court releases eight rights activists on bail in terrorism trial,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Wednesday ordered the release on bail of eight human rights activists, including the director of the local branch of Amnesty International, pending a verdict in their trial on terrorism charges. The case against the activists, who number 11 in total and who face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty, has become a flashpoint in Turkey s tense relations with Europe and heightened concern that an important NATO member is sliding further towards authoritarianism under President Tayyip Erdogan. Among those ordered released were Idil Eser, the director of Amnesty in Turkey, as well as Peter Steudtner, a German national, and Ali Gharavi, a Swede. Under the terms of their release, Steudtner and Gharavi are not required to remain in Turkey before the next court date on Nov. 22. Two other activists were released on bail prior to the start of Wednesday s trial. Another, Amnesty s local chairman, is still being held in the coastal province of Izmir where he faces charges in a separate case.  I think we re all more than relieved,  a tearful Steudtner told reporters after he walked out of the Silivri prison, outside of Istanbul, a few hours later.  We are really grateful for everyone who supported us legally (and) diplomatically.  The case had brought widespread condemnation from rights groups, some Western governments and, on social media, prominent activists such as Edward Snowden. Almost all of the eleven were detained in July after participating in a workshop on digital security held on an island off the coast of Istanbul. The prosecutor has alleged a range of charges, including helping the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of engineering last year s coup attempt.  It is a happy development that our friends are released, but this case should have never been brought,  said one of the defense lawyers, Erdal Dogan.  We need a state of law and we need the support of our citizens.      Germany, which has seen a steady deterioration in ties with Turkey over the case and other rows, said it welcomed the decision, even though it remained concerned about Ankara s record on rights.  That is an encouraging signal, a first step,  Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in a statement, adding that many Germans remained imprisoned in Turkey for no clear reason.  Eser, the local Amnesty director, had earlier told the court that she had been arrested for doing her job.    I don t understand how I can be associated with three different terrorist organizations by having attended a workshop,  she said.  I don t have anything to regret. I just did my work as a human rights defender.  The prosecutor has cited Amnesty s links to jailed hunger strikers and alleged that some of the defendants had contact with people who had downloaded the encrypted messaging app used by the plotters of last year s failed coup. Another accused, Ozlem Dalkiran, told the court:  I have no idea why we re here.    I dedicated my life to truth, human rights and justice. Now I am here being charged with membership in a terrorist organization,  said Dalkiran, a member of the Turkish arm of the Citizens  Assembly rights organization. Authorities have jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial in a crackdown following the failed military coup. Erdogan says the purges across society are necessary to maintain stability in a key NATO country bordering Iran, Iraq and Syria. European allies fear he is using the investigations to check opposition and undermine the judiciary. The case has worsened Turkey s already fraught relations with the European Union. Shortly after the arrests, Germany said it was reviewing Turkey s applications to buy weaponry from Germany. A cabinet minister in Berlin compared Ankara s behavior to that of the former communist East Germany. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Turkey s 12-year-old attempt to join the European Union should be halted, although Ankara has said it remains determined to press on with its accession process.

Trump says Russia hurting U.S. efforts on North Korea nuclear issue,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Russia was hurting U.S. efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons while China had been helpful. In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump said it would be easier to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue if the United States had a better relationship with Russia.  China is helping us and maybe Russia s going through the other way and hurting what we re getting,  Trump said of the North Korea situation. A series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have ratcheted up tensions. Trump has pressed China to help rein in North Korea s nuclear program. China, North Korea s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. Trump said in a tweet that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday and the conversation included North Korea. U.S.-Russia relations have been strained over allegations Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Moscow s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its backing of the Syrian government.   I think we could have a good relationship  with Russia, Trump said. I think that North Korean situation would be easier settled.

"Japan to propose strategic dialogue with U.S., India and Australia: Nikkei","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will propose a strategic dialogue among leaders of the United States, India and Australia, aiming at counteracting China s expansion under its  Belt and Road  policy, Foreign Minister Taro Kono told the Nikkei business daily. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to propose the idea to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6 when they plan to hold a summit meeting, said the Nikkei on Thursday.  The proposal is for the leaders of the four nations to promote free trade and defense cooperation across the land and sea to Southeast, South and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East and Africa, Kono said in the interview with the Nikkei conducted on Wednesday.  We are in an era when Japan has to exert itself diplomatically by drawing a big strategic picture,  Kono was quoted as saying.  To maintain free and open ocean, the economy and security will surely be on the table,  he said. Kono said the aim was to also promote high-quality infrastructure investment across Asia to Africa. Chinese President Xi Jinping s vast  Belt and Road  infrastructure project was included in the ruling Communist Party s constitution on Tuesday, giving it greater policy heft and added pressure to succeed. The  Belt and Road  plan, a  Silk Road -like initiative, is a vehicle for China to take a greater role on the international stage by funding and building global transport and trade links in more than 60 countries. Kono also said putting pressure on North Korea would  certainly be necessary  to make Pyongyang dismantle its missile and nuclear development, according to the Nikkei. He said if North Korea accepted a review by International Atomic Energy Agency it would be  the most trustworthy  option for conditions for talks between Pyongyang and the international community.

Brazil's Congress rejects corruption case against President Temer,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian lawmakers rejected corruption charges against President Michel Temer on Wednesday evening, shelving a case that had threatened to oust a center-right leader who investors hope will bring Brazil s budget deficit under control. The corruption case, involving the payment of bribes by meatpacker JBS SA (JBSS3.SA), had paralyzed Temer s reform agenda for six months and weakened his government. The lower house of Brazil s Congress, which has the authority to decide whether a president should stand trial by the Supreme Court, voted 251-233 to throw out charges of obstruction of justice and organized crime filed by federal prosecutors.  The vote means that Temer is safe from prosecution while he remains president. But he is still subject to investigation and possible trial by lower courts after his term ends in late 2018. While Temer s opponents were far from the 342 votes - or two-thirds of the seats - needed to put him on trial, he got 12 votes less than in August when the lower house voted 263-227 to block an initial corruption charge against him. The slip in support signals Temer will have trouble passing a pension reform bill that is crucial for plugging Brazil s budget deficit. Many lawmakers are reluctant to back the reform, which would make Brazilians work more years before retirement. The speaker of the house, Rodrigo Maia, said the shelving of the charges against Temer cleared the way for the government and Congress to move ahead with the pension reform debate. Allies said Brazil could not afford the upheaval of removing a second president in little over a year, as Latin America s largest economy struggles to overcome deep recession. Temer succeeded impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff in 2016. Opponents criticized Temer for making policy concessions and fast-tracking pork barrel spending to win votes to ensure his survival. To please the powerful farm lobby that has two-fifths of the votes in the lower house, Temer agreed to lower fines for environmental damage. He attempted to relax a definition of slave labor, but was forced to backtrack after an outcry. A few hours before the vote, Temer was taken to hospital in pain due to a urinary tract obstruction, a health scare that triggered a brief selloff in financial markets. His office said he underwent a bladder test by catheter and left the hospital later on Wednesday. Temer, 77, was recently diagnosed with a partial coronary artery blockage. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP closed up 0.47 percent at 76,706 points after the house reached a quorum allowing the vote to go ahead. Earlier, it touched session lows on the news that Temer was in the hospital. Stocks later pared losses and the currency was flat after his office gave details of his condition.

"U.S. has lost trust in South Sudan, Trump envoy tells president","JUBA (Reuters) - The United States has lost trust in South Sudan s government for fueling the country s civil war and it must bring peace or risk losing support from Washington, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the nation s President Salva Kiir.  Haley was the first senior member of President Donald Trump s administration to visit South Sudan, which spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after gaining independence from Sudan. She met one on one with Kiir for some 45 minutes.   I let him know that the United States was at a crossroads and that every decision going forward was going to be based on his actions,  Haley told reporters after the meeting in the capital Juba. The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan, which has forced some 4 million people to flee their homes, was providing  fertile ground  for a genocide. Kiir s government has denied U.N. allegations of ethnic cleansing. Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp for South Sudanese displaced by the violence amid rowdy anti-Kiir protests.   He understood that Americans were disappointed in his leadership in South Sudan, I made that very clear. And he understood that all the aid or help that he hopes will go forward is not a given,  she said.  Haley did not elaborate on what further action Washington could take, but said that Kiir  got what I was trying to say.  On Monday she said Washington was considering how to pressure Kiir into peace, though noted that withdrawing aid may not work. The Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief.  We have lost trust in the government and we now need to regain that trust and the only way to regain that trust is through the actions of taking care of all of the people,  Haley told South Sudan s Eye Radio. She demanded that Kiir allow full and consistent humanitarian aid access and bring peace and stability to the country. She said she pushed a timeline for Kiir to act, but declined to elaborate.  Nhial Deng Nihal, a senior adviser to Kiir, said the president told Haley his government and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan had established  mechanisms that work jointly to improve and address the humanitarian problems.  He also told reporters that Kiir said government troops  will also be observing a cessation of hostilities in order to create an atmosphere for dialogue.  The civil war was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer. It has plunged parts of the world s youngest nation into famine. A fragile peace deal broke down last year and Machar fled the country. He is being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.  Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp in Juba, where U.N. peacekeepers are protecting some 30,000 displaced people, after hundreds of rowdy pro-Machar protesters blocked nearby roads, yelling  Salva Kiir is a killer  and  Welcome USA.  Protesters held a large sign that read  South Sudan IDPs (internally displaced people) and refugees love President Trump, the peacemaker and supporter of human rights.   A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission said the protest  started to gain momentum after (Haley) left, IDPs became upset that she was not able to meet with them.  Haley was meeting with a displaced family when she had to leave early due to security concerns.  The previous U.S. administrations of President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama were heavily involved in the birth of South Sudan, which signed a peace accord with Sudan in 2005 and gained independence in 2011. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
North Korea diplomat says take atmospheric nuclear test threat 'literally',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The recent warning from North Korea s foreign minister of a possible atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean should be taken literally, a senior North Korean official told CNN in an interview aired on Wednesday.  The foreign minister is very well aware of the intentions of our supreme leader, so I think you should take his words literally,  Ri Yong Pil, a senior diplomat in North Korea s Foreign Ministry, told CNN. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said last month Pyongyang may consider conducting  the most powerful detonation  of a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean amid rising tensions with the United States. The minister made the comment after President Donald Trump warned that North Korea, which has been working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, would be totally destroyed if it threatened America. CIA chief Mike Pompeo said last week that North Korea could be only months away from gaining the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons. Experts say an atmospheric test would be a way of demonstrating that capability. All of North Korea s previous nuclear tests have been conducted underground. Trump next week will make a visit to Asia during which he will highlight his campaign to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs. Despite the bellicose rhetoric, White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the standoff. But all options, including military ones, are on the table.  The U.S. Navy said on Wednesday a third aircraft carrier strike group was now sailing in the Asia-Pacific region, joining two other carriers, the Ronald Reagan and Theodore Roosevelt.  Navy officials said the Nimitz, which was previously carrying out operations in support of the fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, would be ready to support operations in the region before heading back to its home port. It said the movement had been long planned.  A leading South Korea opposition figure, Hong Jun-pyo, head of the conservative Liberty Korea Party, told Reuters in Washington on Wednesday he backed Trump s tough stance. Hong said he had met with members of Congress and the administration and told them a majority of South Koreans wanted U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, which were withdrawn from the Korean peninsula in 1992, returned, or for South Korea to develop a nuclear capability of its own.  The only way to deal with the situation is by having a nuclear balance between the North and the South,  said Hong, the runner-up in South Korea s 2017 presidential election. Reintroducing nuclear weapons remains unlikely, not least because it would undermine demands from Seoul and Washington for North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs. Trump spoke during his election campaign about the possibility of South Korea and Japan acquiring nuclear weapons,  but administration officials have played down the remarks and given no indication of any plan to redeploy tactical weapons. On Wednesday, Trump was asked whether he would visit the tense demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea during his Asia tour and responded enigmatically.  I d rather not say, but you ll be surprised,  he told reporters. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
U.S. House passes sanctions on Iran-backed Hezbollah,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday backed new sanctions on Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia, part of an effort to take a tough line against Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement. Three Hezbollah-related measures passed by voice vote, without opposition. The House will vote on Thursday on another bill, to impose additional sanctions on Iran related to its ballistic missiles program. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 13 he would not certify Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. Trump s action opened a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose sanctions on Iran s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement, but there has been no move to do so in the House or Senate. Aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the Hezbollah and missile-related sanctions. The first of the Hezbollah-related measures passed on Wednesday would impose new sanctions on any entities found to support the group, such as by providing weapons to Hezbollah. The second imposes sanctions on Iran and Hezbollah for using civilians as human shields. The third was a resolution urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. The United State named Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. Earlier this month, Washington offered multimillion-dollar rewards for two of its officials as the Trump administration developed its strategy for countering Iran s growing regional influence.  These critical measures will impose new sanctions to crack down on Hezbollah s financing, and hold it accountable for its acts of death and destruction,  said Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. However, winning international support for an intensified campaign against Hezbollah could prove difficult. The powerful organization is part of Lebanon s fragile coalition government and commands enormous support for the social services it provides. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Brazil's Congress blocks corruption charges against President Temer,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The lower house of Brazil s Congress voted on Wednesday to reject charges filed by prosecutors against President Michel Temer in a case involving bribes allegedly paid by meatpacker JBS SA, sparing him trial by the Supreme Court. With 136 lawmakers voting to throw out the charges, and given a quorum of 477 of them present, Temer s opponents could no longer reach the 342 votes required to authorize the top court to put him on trial.

German parties brace for tough coalition talks on migration,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The three parties exploring a possible coalition in Germany face an early test of their willingness to compromise on Thursday when they try to hammer out a common stance on deeply divisive immigration and asylum policy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to patch together a tricky three-way coalition after her party suffered bruising losses in a national election three weeks ago - losses that even some of her allies blame on her refugee policies. Germany s demographic landscape changed overnight in 2015 with her decision, in the face of refugee flows on a scale not seen since World War Two, to open the borders to over a million migrants fleeing war in the Middle East and Africa. While some hailed the move as a humanitarian act, it was less popular in her own conservative camp, where many blame her for the subsequent surge in the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, which took seats from her bloc. Within her conservative bloc, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) is demanding a cap on refugee numbers, rejected by Merkel as unconstitutional. To her left, the Greens oppose what they see as a populist-driven tightening of asylum rules. With parties far apart, Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) warned that talks could rapidly descend into conflict with Greens on the sensitive matter of allowing family members to join migrants in Germany.  The CSU s talk of an upper limit is empty,  Lindner told Der Spiegel magazine.  But I have sympathy for the CSU s calls for a change in immigration policy given the need for order,  he added, warning Merkel against compromising with the Greens.  Once control has been re-established, then we can be more open again on family reunification,  he said.  Until then it must be strictly limited to cases of hardship and to the core family - parents and children.  In the first two round of coalition talks, the three parties defied expectations by finding substantial common ground on fiscal policy.  But politicians from all parties have said it could take months to clinch agreement on what would be Germany s first three-way coalition for decades. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"Kenya opposition leader urges vote boycott, civil disobedience","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Opposition leader Raila Odinga urged Kenyans to boycott Thursday s repeat presidential election, saying he would lead a campaign of civil disobedience. Odinga spoke shortly after the Supreme Court said it was unable to consider a last-minute appeal to delay the vote after five out of seven judges failed to turn up. The repeat election was ordered by the Supreme Court on Sept. 1 after judges nullified the results of the Aug. 8 presidential contest on procedural grounds. The election commission had said Odinga lost to President Uhuru Kenyatta by 1.4 million votes. Odinga is refusing to participate in Thursday s contest because he says the election commission has failed to implement reforms to prevent it being, once again, marred by irregularities.  We advise Kenyans who value democracy and justice to hold vigil and prayers away from polling stations, or just stay at home,  he told a cheering crowd in Nairobi s Uhuru Park, backing away from previous promise to call large-scale protests.   Convince your friends, neighbors and everyone else not to participate,  he said in English. If they support the president, he cautioned:  do not insult or assault them. Instead, seek to open their eyes.  But several speakers who preceded him gave speeches in KiSwahili calling on opposition supporters not to allow people to vote.  With the Supreme Court unable to hear petitions to delay the vote, election officials said it would go ahead, regardless of Odinga s decision. The head of the national election board, Wafula Chebukati, said the vote would proceed even if some polling stations were unable to open.  In cases where there will be problems (delivering materials) ... the polling officer will have the right to inform us and polling can be suspended to another day.  Seeking to explain the Supreme Court s absences, Chief Justice David Maraga said one judge was unwell, another was abroad and another was unable to attend after her bodyguard was shot and wounded on Tuesday night. It was unclear why the others did not show up. Turmoil ahead of the election prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a statement saying it was  deeply concerned  by efforts by both parties to undermine the independence of the electoral commission. It condemned the attack on the deputy chief justice s bodyguard and urged Kenyans to reject violence. Minutes after Maraga s remarks on live television, hundreds of supporters took to the streets of Kisumu, Odinga s main stronghold. Riot police used teargas to disperse them. Two protesters received gunshot wounds, a Reuters witness said.  If the government subverts the sovereign will of the people ... then people are entitled to rebel against this government,  Kisumu governor Anyang Nyong o, a hardline Odinga supporter, told reporters. Such comments seem certain to fuel fears of a major confrontation with security forces, already blamed for killing nearly 50 people in Kisumu and Nairobi slums after the canceled August vote. Months of political uncertainty have blunted growth in Kenya, East Africa s biggest economy and a key Western ally valued for its relative freedom and stability in a tumultuous region.  Kenyatta is keen for the poll to proceed to cement his rule.   Many wonder when or if ever all this politicking will end,  he said in a televised speech on Wednesday evening.  I call to each and every one of us to turn out once again and vote.   For some citizens, the instability has rekindled memories of large-scale ethnic violence that killed 1,200 people following a disputed election in 2007. Meanwhile, in anticipation of possible violence ahead of the elections on Thursday, shoppers crammed into Nairobi s upmarket Carrefour supermarket to stock up on food, said Jason Straziuso, who had to wait nearly two hours to pay for his groceries.    There was about 40 carts per register, everyone was jockeying for position trying to find the shortest line,  he said.  Every single cart was as full as it could be.  Single mother Marian Elema said she had paid double the usual bus fare for to take her five children to her home town Isiolo, in central Kenya, because she feared violence would break out in the port city of Mombasa where they live.   I decided to travel home to escape possible clashes between opposition supporters and police,  she told Reuters.  I am not here to vote but for the safety of my children.  In Kisumu s tallying center, election officer John Ngutai sat huddled with a handful of other officials, waiting for missing election material and hundreds of absent colleagues. He said attacks by opposition supporters last week meant the election board had only managed to train 250 out of 1,300 staff needed to hold the election in his constituency.  Our trainings were disrupted and officials attacked, so some people withdrew,  he said.  Even if the election goes ahead, the opposition might still challenge the result in the Supreme Court. Judges said they were prepared to annul the re-run, and send the country of 45 million back to square one, if the election does not meet the required standards. In a ruling early on Wednesday, High Court Judge George Odunga said some local election officials had been appointed in an irregular manner, but to withdraw them at the last minute would only make an already dire situation worse.  For the elections to proceed in the absence of the said officers would in my view be a constitutional crisis of unimaginable magnitude. Simply put, it would be a recipe for chaos.  However, he admitted that not dismissing them could form the grounds for legal challenges afterwards.  Opposition lawyers seeking to challenge Thursday s vote might also cite the failure of the election board to hold elections in all parts of the country, if enough polling stations are unable to open.  The constitution does not stipulate a minimum turnout, but says the election should be held at the same time in all parts of the country. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Thailand kicks off sumptuous funeral of King Bhumibol Adulyadej,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand on Wednesday marked the start of a lavish, five-day funeral for King Bhumibol Adulyadej with a Buddhist religious ceremony attended by senior members of its royal family. King Bhumibol, who died last year aged 88, will be cremated on Thursday on a royal pyre within a cremation complex of gold pavilions in front of Bangkok s Grand Palace, in a ceremony that is expected to draw about 250,000 mourners. Thailand has observed a year of mourning for King Bhumibol, who was regarded as a pillar of stability during a reign of seven decades that witnessed political upheaval and rapid development in the Southeast Asian nation.   It s overwhelming,  said one mourner, Aporn Wongdee, 60,  who hails from the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat.  I ve been here for two days already and I want to see our father to heaven.       A sum of $90 million has been set aside for the funeral, the likes of which has never been seen in Thailand, officials involved in the funeral preparations said. King Maha Vajiralongkorn, known as Rama X, who inherited the throne in December on his father s death, arrived at the Grand Palace by car on Wednesday as soldiers dressed in red uniforms and black hats stood to attention.  He was flanked by his two daughters. Live television images from inside the palace showed the king lighting candles in front of his father s coffin and a symbolic royal urn. The Buddhist funeral ceremony, mixed with Hindu rituals, was attended by 119 Buddhist monks who chanted prayers in the ancient Pali language. Queues of black-clad mourners, many carrying portraits of the king, snaked around parts of Bangkok s old town, waiting to enter the cremation area. By mid-afternoon, 25,000 mourners had gathered around the cremation site, city police said. In what is expected to be an emotionally-charged morning, King Bhumibol s body will be moved on Thursday from the Grand Palace to a crematorium in a public square in front, where thousands of people have already pitched tents to ensure places. On Thursday, three processions will make their way from the palace to the cremation site - a series of specially-erected Thai pavilions that took nearly a year to build. Some Thais have folded flowers of sandalwood paper to be used in the cremation, in the belief that their fragrance guides the soul of the departed to heaven. The cremation day has been declared a national holiday, when banks will be closed and major shopping centers will be shut from 3 p.m. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Trump declines to say if he will visit Korean DMZ on Asia trip,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump declined to say on Wednesday whether he will visit the Korean Peninsula s demilitarized zone during an upcoming Asia tour.  I d rather not say, but you ll be surprised,  Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn as he prepared to depart on a trip to Dallas.  Trump is scheduled to depart on Nov. 3 on a trip that includes visits to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. His trip is expected to be heavily dominated by the nuclear and ballistic missile threat that North Korea poses. The DMZ is a border barrier between South and North Korea and is a traditional stop for American dignitaries. White House officials say Trump is to visit South Korea s Camp Humphreys during his visit to South Korea to hail the U.S.-South Korean alliance.  There are no concerns about what message Trump would send by not going to the DMZ, a senior White House official told reporters on Monday.  The message is that we are guests during a state visit of President Moon Jae-in, who s invited us to make a visit to Camp Humphreys. So we ll keep talking with the South Korean government to see if there are things that they want to adjust,  the official said. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Canada's indigenous population undergoes dramatic growth: census,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada s indigenous population is growing four times faster than the rest the country, census data showed on Wednesday, marking a dramatic increase in the ranks of people who have long struggled with poverty and marginalization. A growing number of Canadians identifying themselves as indigenous, a higher fertility rate and a higher life expectancy for indigenous people than in the past help explain the rapid growth rate, Statistics Canada said.  Canada s indigenous population grew 42.5 percent in the 10  years to 2016 to 1.7 million people, compared to 11 percent growth for Canada as a whole, Statistics Canada said, in data released from the 2016 census.   The findings show a young population, with an average age of 32.1 years, compared with 40.9 for the non-aboriginal population.  The census, which showed indigenous people accounting for nearly 5 percent of the population overall, also found a younger generation significantly more likely to be raised in foster care. Indigenous children made up 7.7 percent of all Canadians under 5 but more than half of the children were in foster homes, according to the census data. The census also found that one fifth of the indigenous population lives in over-crowded housing, and 44 percent of indigenous people on reserves were living in homes that needed major repairs.  Last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada had failed its indigenous people. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Trudeau acknowledged the dark history of Canada s colonization as one of  humiliation, neglect and abuse  and promised to do more. Statistics Canada estimated that by 2036, indigenous people will comprise one-fifth of the populations of the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan - potentially giving them greater political clout.  Canada s indigenous people come from hundreds of nations and bands, with more than 70 distinct languages. They include First Nations, M tis, people of mixed indigenous and European background, and Inuit, who largely inhabit Canada s north. Population growth between 2006 and 2016 was highest for M tis, at 51.2 percent. That appeared to result, at least in part,  from more people calling themselves M tis rather than from a mushrooming M tis birth rate, Statistics Canada figures suggest. In 2011, M tis women s birth rate was just 12.5 percent higher than that of non-indigenous women.   I think these are people who are kind of dipping their toe into these identity waters,  said Chris Andersen, a professor and dean of Native Studies at the University of Alberta.

Turkey court releases eight activists on bail in terrorism case,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Wednesday ordered the release on bail of eight defendants, including the director of the local branch of Amnesty International and two foreign nationals, pending the verdict in their on-going trial on terrorism charges. The next hearing is set for Nov.22.   The trial of the 11 activists, who face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty, has become a flashpoint in Turkey s tension with Europe. Most them were detained in July after participating in a workshop on digital security held on island off the coast of Istanbul. The prosecutor has alleged a range of charges, including the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the network of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of engineering last year s coup attempt. Two of the activists were released on bail prior to the start of Wednesday s trial. Another, the chairman of Amnesty International s local arm, is being held in the coastal province of Izmir where he faces charges in an additional case. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1

Iran says defense capabilities not negotiable amid U.S. pressure,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran s defense capabilities are not negotiable, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday in remarks made previously but which now come amid increased pressure from the U.S. government over Tehran s ballistic missile program. Ties between Iran and the United States have deteriorated under U.S. President Donald Trump and suffered another deep blow two weeks ago when he decided not to certify that Tehran is complying with a 2015 nuclear pact and warning he might ultimately terminate it. Iran has reacted defiantly, dismissing Trump s demands for the pact to be toughened up. Last week, Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards, the most powerful military force in the country, said its ballistic missile program would accelerate despite U.S. and European Union pressure to suspend it.  The defense capabilities and strength of the country are not negotiable or up for haggling,  Khamenei was cited as saying at a ceremony at the Imam Ali army officer s academy in Tehran, according to state media. The ramping up of rhetoric on both sides has raised the specter of a possible military confrontation between the two countries. In recent months, small boats from the Revolutionary Guards navy have swarmed close to American warships in the Gulf, prompting the U.S. navy to fire flares and warning shots. Under the landmark 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, the Islamic Republic agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of a number of sanctions. The U.S. Senate is considering new legislation which could lead to Washington restoring sanctions on Iran should it test a ballistic missile able to carry a warhead or bar nuclear inspectors from any sites. In response, Khamenei said last week that Tehran would stick to the nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would  shred  the deal if Washington pulled out.

U.S. forces have repeatedly launched drone and air strikes against Yemen s al Qaeda branch, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The group has taken advantage of a more than two-year-old civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s Saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country.

Three people die in bomb and gun attacks in Somalia,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Three people died in Somalia on Wednesday in different attacks, one of which targeted a patrol of peacekeepers near the country s capital, Mogadishu, officials told Reuters.  A roadside bomb killed one African Union peacekeeper and wounded another as they patrolled Arbis, a village about 23 kilometers southwest of Mogadishu, according to Wilson Rono, a spokesman for the African Union peacekeeping force AMISOM. A counter-attack by AMISOM killed four al Shabaab fighters, Rono said. Al Shabaab is the Islamist militant group fighting to topple Somalia s western-backed government and replace it with one strictly adhering to Islamic sharia law.  The group also frequently targets AMISOM, which is supporting the central government.  Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab s military spokesman, told Reuters the group had killed four AMISOM soldiers and injured two others in the assault   We have not lost anyone,  Abu Musab said, adding that AMISOM had killed civilian as it responded to the attack. In a second incident late on Wednesday evening, a bomb exploded as it was being prepared in a house in Mogadishu s Karan district, according to Mohamed Osman, a police officer.  It killed one man and injured another,  Osman said. A female police officer was also killed in Mogadishu s Hodan district by gunmen who quickly disappeared, a police official said.

EU envoys start discussion on ties with London after Brexit,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union nations except Britain began preparing on Wednesday for a transition period in relations with London and for their future ties after Brexit, with meetings over the next month aimed at drawing up guidelines for EU leaders in December. Brussels envoys from the 27 EU states that will remain in the bloc after Britain exits on March 29, 2019, met for the first time since EU leaders last week decided not enough progress had been made in talks on the terms of the divorce with Britain to start discussions about future relations yet. To encourage stronger efforts, EU leaders said they would start preparing now for talks on a transition period so they are ready if enough progress is made by the next summit in December.  The process will start now, in the sense that we will meet successively... over the coming month,  one EU official involved in the talks said, adding there was likely to be discussion on the subject also during a ministerial meeting on Nov 20.  We will prepare our thinking on the transition, the future relationship, and the possible additional guidelines for the December European Council,  the official said.  The outcome of the work would likely be presented in the December summit conclusions if leaders decide that enough progress was made on the divorce terms, officials said. Britain wants an outline agreement with the European Union in place by the end of March 2018 on the transitional arrangements that will apply temporarily after it leaves the bloc, Brexit minister David Davis said on Wednesday. EU officials said that was a very tough goal, but one that could be achieved if London showed enough willingness.  It s not so much if we can do it by the first quarter, but if we can get the UK to engage in a way that makes that possible,  the official said. Both sides expect a transition period of around two years. The EU s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Tuesday said that would mean preserving the status quo as Britain would stay subject to EU laws and courts during that time. In an interview with Belgium s L Echo newspaper, Barnier said the only difference between full EU membership now and the transition period would be that  the British would no longer take part in decisions on European legislation . EU officials said the extra two years of transition would buy time for talks about a future free trade agreement, but poured cold water on the idea of extending the exit negotiations beyond that period with a view to keeping Britain within the EU.  I don t think anyone foresees an extension of the existing negotiation period,  the EU official said.  We ve already danced around with the UK for so long. First with Cameron. Then their referendum. Now this. It needs to end at some point,  the official said. Businesses in Britain and in Europe are very concerned by the slow progress in Brexit talks. Not knowing what the future trade agreement between Britain and its biggest trading partner, the EU, will be, some have already started moving staff and operations out of Britain to hedge their bets. More could follow should no more clarity be given by the two negotiating sides by the end of the year. Barnier said that Britain could not count on a bespoke trade deal after Brexit and that since it has ruled out following the example of Norway s relations with the EU it would probably have to model its ties on an arrangement the EU has with Canada. Non-EU Norway currently pays for access to the bloc s single market of 500 million people, though it is not part of the same customs union. In exchange, it is also obliged to allow the free movement of people in and out of the EU. Britain wants to leave both the EU s internal market and the customs union, meaning a  Canada +  scenario is more likely. The European bloc s trade deal with Canada, its most ambitious arrangement yet, has just taken effect. Under the deal Canada can still pursue its own bilateral trade agreements elsewhere in the world. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Crisis over Catalan independence nears crucial few days,"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont kept friends and foes guessing on Wednesday on whether he intends to unilaterally declare independence as the Spanish government prepares to impose direct rule to stop the region breaking away. Puigdemont spurned an invitation to explain his position to the Senate in Madrid on Thursday   an indication of the rigid stands taken by both sides in Spain s gravest political crisis since the end of the Franco dictatorship in 1975. He also kept his silence on whether to call for a new regional election, a move which might prompt the Madrid government to postpone its plan to take over Catalonia s institutions and police. The next few days could prove crucial in the  battle of wills that has followed an independence referendum on Oct. 1, which Madrid declared illegal and the Catalan government said endorsed its claim to statehood. While it is not clear how the central government will take over in practical terms, nor how Catalan civil servants and police will react, some independence supporters have threatened a campaign of civil disobedience, raising the possibility of ugly confrontations. The Catalan secessionist drive is the most serious existential challenge to a Western European country since the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, when voters in the end decided to stay part of the United Kingdom.  It has caused deep resentment elsewhere in Spain, caused a flight of business from the wealthy region, and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent. Madrid has rejected Puigdemont s calls for dialogue to resolve the situation, saying he first must withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence made earlier this month. But it did invite to him address the Senate on Thursday.  However, late on Wednesday the Catalan leader turned down the offer, a spokesman for the regional government said, on the grounds that Madrid had already announced its plans to impose direct control on the autonomous region. The Senate is expected to give the green light for that on Friday morning. It was still unclear if Puigdemont would make a unilateral declaration of independence, which, given the opposition from the Madrid government as well as European leaders, would be merely symbolic. Also up in the air was whether he would call a snap regional election, something a senior Catalan politician said on Tuesday was being considered. He could still do this on Friday before the Senate strips him of his powers and imposes direct rule. Some Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalan newspapers, have backed the idea as a snap election could forestall direct rule and help break the deadlock. Calling an election could also either strengthen Puigdemont s mandate if pro-independence parties won, or allow him a graceful exit if they did not. An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot, in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government. The actual steps to enforce direct rule could be taken gradually in order not to inflame the situation. Catalonia said on Monday it was confident its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to take over institutions. Analyst Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said Puigdemont was caught between radicals and moderates in the Catalan establishment. Radical elements want him to make the Catalan parliament declare independence unilaterally on Thursday or Friday. This would provoke a tough government reaction, playing into their hands, he said. More moderate voices have said that if he calls an early election, he could stop the imposition of direct rule.  Both sides are engaged in a game to tag each other with the blame for what happens next,  Barroso said. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Victims of South Sudan attack on aid workers start testifying from U.S.,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Foreign victims of an attack on aid workers in South Sudan began giving testimony via video link from the United States on Wednesday in the trial of government soldiers accused of murder and gang rape. The assault on the Terrain Hotel in the South Sudan capital Juba in July 2016, at the end of a battle between government and rebel forces, left a South Sudanese aid worker dead and at least five foreign women raped.  We had testimony from one of the victims through a video conference,  prosecution lawyer Philips Anyang told Reuters, without giving details. He added that a second victim was scheduled to testify on Thursday. Six witnesses are to testify from the United States, with the assistance of the FBI. The military trial in Juba is not open to the media. U.N. investigators and rights groups have frequently accused both the South Sudanese army and rebels of murder, torture and rape, and say such crimes almost always go unpunished.  The civil war, which has killed tens of thousands, broke out in 2013 between the army of President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and rebels of former vice president Riek Machar, a Nuer. The trial of 12 suspects in the hotel attack is the first prosecution in South Sudan of soldiers accused of committing atrocities. It had been stalled due to a lack of witness evidence. Previously, the court in Juba demanded witnesses travel to South Sudan to testify, but most were unwilling to do so out of safety and confidentiality concerns. The court has now dropped that requirement.  For [the court] to concede that point was a sign that they were willing to accept victims  concerns and victims  wishes to be a lot more sensitive,  one woman who was raped in the attack told Reuters before the trial began. Another woman told Reuters before the trial that she had been gang-raped by 15 men in the hotel incident. She said she wanted to testify because most victims of such crimes in South Sudan did not get justice.  To stand up and put it on the record that these atrocities are being committed by forces ... is an amazing opportunity that I had to take,  she said. Also testifying will be at least one eyewitness to the murder of the South Sudanese aid worker, John Gatluak, a Nuer who had worked for U.S.-funded organization Internews, Anyang told Reuters.

"Kazakhstan to re-examine 2004 banker's death, may target Nazarbayev critic","ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakh state prosecutors said on Wednesday they will re-investigate the 2004 death of a prominent banker after the man convicted of accidentally killing him said he had in fact been hired to do so by Mukhtar Ablyazov, a former oligarch turned opponent of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The Central Asian nation s government has accused Ablyazov, who has been living in France, of embezzling billions of dollars from a local bank he used to run. A French court last year ruled against extraditing him, however, and set him free. The new probe may lead to a fresh extradition request from the former Soviet republic, setting the stage for another prolonged legal battle in European courts. Ablyazov, once a wealthy businessman who became a government minister, led an opposition political movement in the early 2000s until being convicted on corruption charges in 2002. Nazarbayev pardoned him in 2003. But Ablyazov fell out with the strongman leader again in 2009 when the government nationalized BTA, Kazakhstan s biggest bank at the time, of which Ablyazov was the chairman and majority shareholder. He then fled Kazakhstan, whose authorities have since unsuccessfully tried to have him brought back to the country on fraud and embezzlement charges while also seeking to seize his personal assets. On Tuesday, a businessman now in prison for an unrelated crime claimed in a television documentary that he had murdered Ablyazov s former associate in 2004 in a  hit job  ordered by the oligarch. At the time, the death was ruled involuntary manslaughter as the killer said he had accidentally shot banker Yerzhan Tatishev during a hunting trip. Tatishev was the chief executive of BTA; shortly after his death Ablyazov became the bank s chairman. The Prosecutor General s office said on Wednesday it was reopening the case and reclassifying it as murder. Although the prosecutors  statement did not mention Ablyazov, the latter accused the government in a Facebook post on Wednesday of forcing the alleged killer to falsely testify against him. Since a French court set him free last December, Ablyazov has regularly used social networks to criticize Nazarbayev, who has run the oil-rich nation of 18 million since 1989.

EU too? Lawmakers denounce harassment in Brussels,"STRASBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers accused their own parliament on Wednesday of failing to protect staff from sexual harassment, as allegations of abuse in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein case have raised questions over standards also in Brussels  institutions. Debating an emergency motion calling on authorities to beef up rules and enforcement of gender equality laws and sanctions for abuse in workplaces across Europe, members of the European Parliament also demanded the EU legislature stop turning a blind eye to  disgusting  practices by some of their own colleagues.  Here, today, in the very heart of European democracy, we have women being molested and harassed,  Polish member Jadwiga Wisniewska told the chamber.  This is unimaginable.  This month s allegations about Hollywood producer Weinstein - who denies all accusations of non-consensual sex - has set off a wave of reflection about sexual harassment in Europe as in other parts of the world. Several MEPs held signs bearing the Twitter hashtag #metoo.  I have been sexually harassed, just like millions of other women in the European Union,  German member Terry Reintke said.  It is about time that we very clearly say that we should not be ashamed. The perpetrators should be ashamed.  In the EU institutions themselves, with an unusual mix of powerful hierarchies, politics and a culturally diverse workforce drawn from across the continent, women are accusing managers of doing too little for too long to stamp out abuse.  We ve all heard the stories and rumors going on for many years,  Britain s Margot Parker said during the debate in Strasbourg, the Brussels-based parliament s second home.  The very place that claims to legislate against this sort of disgusting behavior is turning a blind eye to its practice.  This week, Parliament President Antonio Tajani spoke of his  shock and indignation  after a Sunday Times report on more than a dozen mostly young female parliamentary aides who complained of groping, stalking and other harassment by male lawmakers. He pledged to step up existing protections to encourage people to come forward, something campaigners say is overdue.  It comes as no surprise to those of us working for years on the fight to end violence against women that sexual harassment is also widespread throughout the EU institutions,  said the European Women s Lobby, a Brussels-based, pan-European organization.  There is still inadequate means to ensure that women still feel safe enough to come forward to report incidences.  At the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU which employs 32,000 people, 55 percent of them women, measures have been in place since 2006 to prevent any form of harassment and to protect whistleblowers. Over the past five years an average of 13 complaints have been made each year, with disciplinary sanctions being imposed in about four cases each year, Commission figures show. Commenting on those figures, European Women s Lobby secretary-general Joanna Maycock, told Reuters that the number of complaints seemed  very low  for the size of the workforce. The Commission s gender equality chief, Czech Commissioner Vera Jourova, said last week that she had herself been a victim of sexual harassment in the past but saw  stigmatization  as preventing many women in Brussels from speaking up. The Weinstein affair was, she feared, the  peak of the iceberg . Jourova was speaking to Brussels  Politico news service, which has set up a confidential website that has garnered more than 30 allegations in a week, from both women and men, of offences including rape, connected to the European Parliament.

Islamic State claims deadly attack on Libyan checkpoint,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Two soldiers were killed and three wounded at a military checkpoint in northeastern Libya on Wednesday, witnesses and officials said, in an attack claimed by Islamic State. A witness said about a dozen armed vehicles had been used in the dawn assault on a checkpoint 60 km (37 miles) south of the city of Ajdabiya run by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA). The attackers set fire to the checkpoint and one of the victims was burned inside his car, said Mustafa Boufjara, a spokesman for Ajdabiya s security department. Images of the checkpoint showed charred checkpoint cabins and two burned cars. In a statement carried by Islamic State s Amaq news agency, IS said its militants had seized a vehicle equipped with a machinegun as well as other weapons and ammunition. Islamic State militants have carried out several attacks on LNA checkpoints in recent months.  The jihadists have been trying to regroup from desert bases since losing their stronghold of Sirte, about 390 km (240 miles) west of Ajdabiya, last December.      ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"In Kenya opposition stronghold, a repeat presidential vote looks unlikely","KISUMU, Kenya (Reuters) - As Kenya prepared to hold a repeat presidential poll on Thursday despite an opposition boycott, a handful of scared election officials huddled by an echoing hall in Kisumu, a stronghold of opposition leader Raila Odinga.    Going out of that gate with this ballot box is like a suicide mission,  26-year-old Evans said on Wednesday. The young man, too frightened to give his last name, is meant to be in charge of one of the constituency s polling stations. But only 19 of his 400 colleagues reported for duty at the Lions Club High School. Drivers meant to transport them to polling stations were too scared to show up.  Kisumu is the heartland of support for Odinga, who is boycotting Thursday s vote because he said the election board has failed to push through reforms.  The repeat vote, meant to pit Odinga against President Uhuru Kenyatta, was ordered by the Supreme Court after it nullified Kenyatta s win in an Aug. 8 presidential poll on procedural grounds. Odinga s boycott leaves Kenyatta as the only serious contender. None of the other five candidates gained more than one percent in August, virtually guaranteeing Kenyatta a second five-year term. At a rally on Wednesday, Odinga dismissed the five as  flower girls  at Kenyatta s wedding.  On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a petition seeking to delay the poll, but was unable to do so after five out of seven judges failed to show up. Minutes after the court announced it could not hear the case, hundreds of Odinga supporters poured onto Kisumu streets, blocking roads with logs and stones and lighting tyres. Most election staff decided to stay home.   I m afraid because it s getting late,  returning officer John Ngutai told Reuters late on Wednesday afternoon.  My staff fear to come.  The officials sitting with Ngutai said they had been attacked twice by Odinga supporters, who targeted training sessions by election officials last week.  Police struggled to save presiding officer Diana Odhiambo, 44, from a stick-wielding crowd of men. Ngutai played video of the incident on his phone, as Odhiambo said:  I love my job, but my family is very nervous.  Ngutai said preparations were far behind schedule, and it wasn t clear if the election could be held. Polling stations are supposed to open at 6 a.m.   The roads are blocked, we can t access the polling stations, the owners of the vehicles to transport my staff are scared,  he sighed, as his phone rang incessantly.  But 26-year-old Evans, burrowed into a deep blue hooded sweater, said he would stick around a little longer because he still believed in the elections.   Our lives are in danger,  he said. But  I m determined to make Kenya better. I believe that following a constitutional process is better.  ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
U.N. nuclear chief to visit Iran this weekend,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog will visit Iran on Sunday for talks with senior officials there, as opposition from the United States threatens to undermine an international accord to curtail Iran s nuclear program. Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will discuss Iran s implementation of the 2015 agreement, the IAEA said on Wednesday. The visit comes during a dispute between Washington and Tehran over U.S. President Donald Trump s decision this month not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers. The U.S. Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the deal, in exchange for restrictions on Iran s nuclear activities. Amano, whose agency is in charge of policing those restrictions, has defended the agreement as a  net gain  for nuclear verification and said Iran s commitments under the deal are being implemented. The IAEA did not mention Trump s refusal to certify Iran was complying with the agreement. European Union leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to the accord, hoping that Congress will prevent the deal from collapsing. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will  shred  the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.

Austrian far right says 'very good start' in Kurz coalition talks,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s far-right Freedom Party said coalition talks with conservative leader Sebastian Kurz made a  very, very good start  on Wednesday, mapping out a process that could end its decade in opposition. Foreign Minister Kurz, who is just 31, and his People s Party won last week s parliamentary election with 31.5 percent of the vote but they need a partner to form a stable government.  Kurz s hard line on immigration and his decision to force the collapse of the current coalition with the Social Democrats, who came second, made the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO) - founded by ex-Nazis in the 1950s - a more willing partner.   It was today a very, very good start to negotiations ... a positive mutual gauging by the negotiating teams,  FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache told a joint news conference with Kurz after the first round of talks at an ornate palace in Vienna. Coalition talks in Austria last roughly two months on average, and Kurz has said he wants a deal by Christmas.  Both men had negotiating teams of four party officials and agreed on five headings for their talks, ranging from  future , for issues such as science and the environment, to a more self-explanatory  security, order and protecting the homeland . The two sides have much common ground on immigration, an issue that dominated the election after Europe s migration crisis left many voters feeling Austria was overrun. But after Wednesday s talks they said they would start with another issue both have focused on: reducing inefficiencies in state spending. Kurz and Strache said they would examine finance ministry data with a view to deciding where savings could be achieved.  Our aim is to find the losses through friction in the system and then of course to deal with where there is the potential to increase efficiency,  Kurz said.  That as a first round should build the foundation for the subsequent negotiations on content.  The rise of far-right parties like France s National Front and the Alternative for Germany since the migration crisis started in 2015 makes it less likely the FPO s accession to power would provoke the same outcry as in 2000, when the European Union imposed short-lived sanctions on Austria. But some European leaders have expressed concern at its strong showing and President Alexander Van der Bellen, who has the power to appoint and dismiss governments, has said any coalition must be guided by  fundamental European values . What that means for the FPO and the talks is unclear. As part of a push to make itself more acceptable to the mainstream, it has stopped calling for Austria to leave the bloc and says it is now  pro-European  while saying Brussels should hand back more powers to member states. That overlaps with Kurz s view that the EU should be slimmed down and focus on tasks like trade and securing external borders.  Europe is of course an issue,  Kurz said when asked why it wasn t in one of the five broad headings for talks, adding that it would come under the heading  state and society .  From my point of view the atmosphere was a very, very positive one,  he added. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"U.S. touts military ties in Philippines as Duterte courts Russia, China","CLARK, Philippines (Reuters) - The timing of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  trip to the Philippines this week couldn t have been better, coming just as it celebrated a victory against Islamist militants in Marawi City - with a critical dose of help from the U.S. military. But as Mattis met President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday, five Russian warships were parked off the Philippines and Moscow was preparing to formally hand over thousands of assault rifles, a million rounds of ammunition and 20 army trucks at a public ceremony on Wednesday. Duterte, known for his strident anti-American rhetoric, has made no secret of his plans to cultivate ties with America s rivals, Russia and China. Those efforts appear to be starting to bear fruit. Just before he met Mattis, Duterte sat down with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Tuesday, who, like Mattis, was attending a gathering of Asian defense ministers north of Manila. Shoigu signed two military deals, including the procurement of unspecified equipment. On Wednesday, Duterte was scheduled to visit a Russian anti-submarine ship, the Admiral Pantaleyev, docked in Manila.  U.S. Ambassador Sung Kim played down any U.S. concerns about Duterte s outreach to China and Russia and noted that the United States, a former colonial power, was the country s only treaty ally, with far deeper ties in the Philippines.  I m not really threatened by this notion that China or Russia are providing some military equipment to the Philippines,  Kim told a small group of reporters traveling with Mattis.   We have been providing very important equipment to the Philippines for many, many years. The fact that the Chinese and the Russians have provided some rifles, I m not sure is really such a cause for concern for the United States.  Duterte s often profanity-laden tirades against the United States have become his trademark during his year-old presidency, and he has chided Washington for treating his country  like a dog,  despite the longstanding U.S. assistance. Still, Duterte s rhetoric has been inconsistent, and he warmly greeted visiting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in August, calling himself a  humble friend  of the United States at the time.  On Tuesday, he cautiously kept to scripted dialogue at the start of his meeting with Mattis, as he welcomed him to the Philippines and spoke warmly of ties.  I want to be (as) politically correct as possible and I want to be understood. So reading this speech will be good,  he said before reporters were escorted out of the room. Ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the Philippines, the U.S. envoy cited an improvement in  tone and substance  in bilateral ties over the 10 months since he s been in his post.  President Duterte has made clear that even as he pursues improved relations with countries like China and Russia, he will continue to focus on making sure that the U.S.-Philippines alliance remains strong,  Kim said. The same day that Mattis landed in the Philippines, Manila announced the end of five months of military operations in a southern city of Marawi held by pro-Islamic State rebels, after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that marked the country s biggest security crisis in years. The rebel occupation stunned a military inexperienced in urban combat and stoked wider concerns that Islamic State loyalists have gained influence among local Muslims and have ambitions to use the island of Mindanao as a base for operations in Southeast Asia. Mattis, on his flight to the Philippines, commended Manila on the operation and on Tuesday discussed ways to deepen U.S.-Philippines military ties in talks with the Philippine defense minister.  It was a tough fight,  Mattis said during his flight, adding he thought the Philippines had sent  a very necessary message to the terrorists.  Kim said the U.S. military assistance made a  huge difference  in the battle in Marawi, particularly its intelligence support, including with the deployment of Gray Eagle and P-3 Orion aircraft.  I think all of us were surprised by the extent of infiltration by the terrorists into Marawi City,  he said.  When you encounter a situation like that, you obviously need good intelligence to be able to target key areas and I think that s where our support was quite critical.  On Monday night, Philippine military chief General Eduardo Ano said the U.S. technical support  tilted the balance  because  we had a very hard grasp of the situation in the early days  until information flowed and helped defeat the militants. The United States also provided information Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gave $1.5 million in January for the attack on Marawi, Ano said. But even on Marawi, Duterte has also credited U.S. rival China for its assistance. Duterte said it was one of the 100 sniper rifles donated by China that fired the bullet that killed Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State s  emir  in Southeast Asia, on Oct. 16. The ranger unit conducting the operation said the shot was fired from a heavier weapon mounted on an armored vehicle.  Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters on Tuesday about the receipt of heavy equipment from China to help rebuild Marawi, and also noted the receipt of rifles and ammunition from Beijing. He expected to receive four fast boats from China before the end of the year. The United States has for decades been the Philippines  defense treaty ally and its biggest source of hardware and training, providing about $1 billion in equipment since 2000.

Mattis praises Philippine army on winning fight in Marawi without rights abuse,"CLARK FREEPORT ZONE, Philippines (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday praised Filipino soldiers for defeating pro-Islamic State militants in a five-month battle in a southern Philippine city without allegations of human rights violations. The Philippines on Monday announced the end of combat operations in Marawi City after troops killed 42 remaining militants, including some foreign fighters. More than 1,100 people, including 165 troops, died in the conflict.  Here s an army that had to go in a fight like that, and they had not one human rights allegation against them with any credibility,  Mattis told reporters at the end of the two-day ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting at a former U.S. air force base.  Not one, and when you look at how bloody awful that fight was, that s really a statement about the Philippine military that set a human rights condition in the midst of that fight the way they did so.  Mattis  praise for the military was a rare appreciation as the Philippines  human rights record under President Rodrigo Duterte has been strongly criticized by Western countries, including the United States, Canada, European Union and Australia. At the U.N. Human Rights Council meeting, these countries called on the Philippines to end killings in Duterte s fierce drug war. More than 3,900 people had been killed by the police, which claimed self-defense, in anti-drug operations since July last year. The United States provided critical tactical intelligence in the Marawi combat operation, deploying surveillance planes and drones, thermal imaging and eavesdropping equipment to help Filipino troops neutralize hundreds of militants who seized the lakeside town on May 23. Mattis exchanged views and discussed security threats in the Asia and Pacific region, like North Korea s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program, maritime security, terrorism and non-traditional military threats. Mattis also reaffirmed Washington s  ironclad commitment  to the alliance with Manila during a meeting on Tuesday night with Duterte, where he emphasized the importance of  shared rules-based international order .  It was a very good discussion with the president and we talked about the way ahead and we re on the same team,  he told reporters. Duterte, known for his strident anti-American rhetoric, has made no secret of his plans to cultivate ties with America s rivals, Russia and China. Those efforts appear to be starting to bear fruit. Duterte on Wednesday visited one of five Russian warships as Moscow donated 5,000 assault rifles, steel helmets, ammunition and 20 army trucks and received China s defense minister later in the day. China donated heavy equipment for the cleanup of Marawi. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
U.S. judge rejects bid to dismiss Indonesian immigrant's lawsuit,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday declined to dismiss a lawsuit by an Indonesian illegal immigrant challenging his detention in a Massachusetts county jail, finding that she had authority to challenge the conditions of his confinement. Terry Rombot was part of a wave of Indonesian Christians who fled their country following deadly riots in 1998. About 70 members of that exodus have been allowed to remain, illegally, in New Hampshire since 2010 under a deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities. However, in August, President Donald Trump instructed ICE in a directive that all immigrants in the United States illegally were subject to deportation. Rombot learned of the policy change when he arrived for an Aug. 1 check-in at ICE s Manchester, New Hampshire, office and was arrested. He was initially held in Massachusetts at the Plymouth County house of corrections, which had filed a bid to dismiss the lawsuit, and since has been moved to Bristol County. Federal courts do not have direct authority over immigration matters, which are handled by the Executive Office for Immigration Review, but Chief Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court in Boston wrote in a court filing on Wednesday that she has a say over the terms of his confinement.  The district court holds jurisdiction to review habeas (corpus) challenges to unlawful immigration detention,  Saris wrote. Writs of habeas corpus challenge illegal detention. At a Friday hearing, Saris expressed concern that ICE had broken its word with Rombot after telling him in 2015 that he would  be given an opportunity to prepare for an orderly departure  before being deported. She also expressed concern he was being held alongside potentially violent criminals. Rombot is one of 47 Indonesian nationals living illegally in New Hampshire involved in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration s move to deport them. ICE officials said the arrangement had always been a temporary one and that the agency always had discretion to deport the people covered by the arrangement. Members of the group and advocates say they fear they could face discrimination or violence if forced to return to the world s largest Muslim-majority country. The Indonesians are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around the city of Dover in New Hampshire s seacoast region. Their cause has drawn the support of the state s all-Democratic congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Governor Chris Sununu. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
India defends ties with North Korea in talks with Tillerson,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India s foreign minister defended the country s ties with North Korea and Iran during talks on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson aimed at building robust relations between the two giant democracies. The Trump administration has launched a new U.S. effort to deepen military and economic ties with India as a way to balance China s assertive posture across Asia.   At the talks with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, both sides pledged to strengthen anti-terrorism cooperation and Tillerson said Washington stood ready to provide India with advanced military technology.   The United States supports India s emergence as a leading power and will continue to contribute to Indian capabilities to provide security throughout the region,  Tillerson told a joint news conference with Swaraj.  But the talks also touched on India s diplomatic ties with North Korea, Swaraj said, at a time when the United States has stepped up efforts to isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. Swaraj said she told the top U.S. diplomat that some level of diplomatic presence was necessary to keep open channels of communication.   As far as the question of embassy goes, our embassy there is very small, but there is in fact an embassy,  she said.  I told Secretary Tillerson that some of their friendly countries should maintain embassies there so that some channels of communication are kept open.  India and North Korea maintain diplomatic offices in each other s capitals, though New Delhi recently banned trade of most goods with the country, except food and medicine. Trade was minimal, Swaraj said. The focus on North Korea comes as U.S. President Donald Trump heads to China next month, where he is expected to urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to try to rein in North Korea. Tillerson, who flew in from Pakistan which he called an important U.S. ally in the restive region, also held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is driving closer ties with the United States. But India, a former leading light of the Non-Aligned Movement and which was on the opposite side of the United States during the Cold War, still remains wary of any alliances with major powers lest it affect its autonomy. India has also maintained ties with Iran which is being targeted by the Trump administration for its alleged military support of extremist groups in the Middle East and for its ballistic missile programme. India has long sourced its oil from Iran, but in recent years the two sides have been also collaborating on key infrastructure projects.  New Delhi is pushing hard for the development of Chabahar port on the Iranian coast as a hub for its trade links to the resource-rich countries of central Asia and Afghanistan but the Trump administration s tough stance has raised new concerns over the future of that project.   But Tillerson struck a conciliatory stance on India s ties with Iran, saying it wouldn t come in the way of countries doing legitimate business there.   It is not our objective to harm the Iranian people nor is it our objective to interfere with legitimate business activities that are going on with other businesses, whether they be from Europe, India or agreements that are in place or promote economic development and activity to the benefit of our friends and allies,  he said.  America s disagreements were with the Iranian regime, and in particular the Iran Revolutionary Guard, he said.  India is especially keen on the Chabahar port as a way to bypass long-time foe Pakistan which does not allow easy trade and transit arrangements to Afghanistan and beyond. Tillerson said the U.S. stood should-to-shoulder with India in the fight against terrorism which New Delhi has long said is centered in militant groups operating from inside Pakistan.  He said militant groups were a threat to everyone in the region, including Pakistan itself.  Quite frankly my view - and I expressed this to the leadership of Pakistan - is we also are concerned about the stability and security of Pakistan s government as well.  The United States has been urging Pakistan to act against the groups that operate in Afghanistan, India and inside Pakistan itself.  Terrorist safe havens will not be tolerated,  Tillerson said. Pakistan says it is doing all it can to fight the militants.  ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"Kurds offer to suspend independence drive, seek talks with Baghdad","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish authorities in Iraq offered on Wednesday to put an independence drive on hold, stepping up efforts to resolve a crisis in relations with Baghdad via dialogue. But an Iraqi military spokesman suggested an offensive - launched to wrest back territory after Kurds voted overwhelmingly for independence in a referendum in September - would continue regardless.  The Iraqi government has transformed the balance of power in the north of the country since launching its campaign last week against the Kurds, who govern an autonomous region of three northern provinces and had held a swathe of other territory.  The fighting between the two sides will not produce a victory for any, it will take the country to total destruction,  the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said in a statement.  The KRG proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and  starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution . Baghdad has always considered the Kurdish secession referendum illegal. It responded last week by seizing back the city of Kirkuk, the oil-producing areas around it and other territory that the Kurds had captured from militant group Islamic State. In a brief social media comment hinting that the campaign would continue, an Iraqi military spokesman said:  Military operations are not connected to politics.  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the KRG should cancel the vote s outcome as a pre-condition for talks. Several Shi ite members of parliament on Wednesday asked him to stick to his position and not to accept just a freeze of the referendum. On Wednesday, Abadi began an official visit to neighboring Turkey and Iran. Turkey and Iran both have Kurdish populations of their own and have supported Baghdad taking a hard line on the referendum. Now that the Kurds have swiftly yielded most of their territory outside of their autonomous region to the advancing Iraqi forces, there are signs of pressure easing. Iran announced the reopening of one of the border crossings with the Kurdistan region, which it had closed earlier this month in support of the Iraqi government. In Ankara, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was ready to give all support to Baghdad as it seeks to reopen a crude oil pipeline from the Kirkuk oilfields to Turkey. The pipeline goes through the Kurdish autonomous region. Iraq had stopped shipping oil through it when the Kurds took Kirkuk in 2014. In a statement to media after meeting Abadi, Erdogan said they discussed what political, military and economic steps they could take after what he called the  illegitimate  Iraqi Kurdish referendum last month.    Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory and has demanded central control of Iraq s border crossings with Turkey, which are all located inside the Kurdish autonomous region. Kurdish Peshmerga forces beat back an advance by Iranian-backed pro-government paramilitaries on Tuesday in the region of Rabi a, 40 km (25 miles) south of the Fish-Khabur border area with Turkey and Syria, Kurdish officials said. Fish-Khabur is strategically vital because oil from both Kurdish and government-held parts of northern Iraq crosses via a pipeline there into Turkey, the main route out of the area for the exports that are crucial to any Kurdish independence bid. The fighting so far has taken place outside the Kurdish autonomous region, but Fish-Khabur is inside it. The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is a close ally of both sides, arming and training both the Kurds and the central government s army to fight Islamic State. U.S. Ambassador Douglas Silliman  worked with Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga to end clashes endangering a Christian community and other civilians  north of Mosul, Washington s Baghdad embassy said on its Twitter account. The Iraqi government s advance over the past week has been achieved with comparatively little violence, with Kurds mostly withdrawing without a fight. But it caused Kurds to flee en masse from Tuz Khurmato, a multi-ethnic city south of Kirkuk where sectarian tension flared after Iraqi forces took control, humanitarian organizations said.Most of those displaced, estimated at nearly 30,000, are in need of urgent aid and staying in open shelters, officials from two international humanitarian organizations told Reuters. Abadi pledged in an interview to the Wall Street Journal to disarm Shiite militias that refuse to come under his control after Islamic State s defeat.  Iraqi forces are preparing in parallel an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border with Syria, the military said on Wednesday. The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is also shrinking there as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.

Iran re-opens border crossing with Iraqi Kurdistan region: state media,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran opened a border crossing with the Kurdistan region of Iraq Wednesday after having closed it following last month s vote in favor of independence in the Kurdish area, Iranian state media reported. Iran backs the Shi ite-led central government in Baghdad in its opposition to Kurdish secession, and Iranian-backed militias assisted government forces when they seized a number of Kurdish cities last week.   The decision comes on the same day as the Kurdish Regional Government offered to put their independence drive on hold, stepping up efforts to resolve a crisis in relations with Baghdad via dialogue rather than military means.  After the referendum and changes within the Kurdistan region our borders with the Kurdistan region of Iraq were closed... today the Bashmagh border is open,  Jahangir Bakhshi, the head of customs for the border crossing, said, according to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) news agency. The report made no mention the KRG s offer for resolving the dispute through talks. The Bashmagh border crossing is located approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of the city of Sulaimaniya in Iraqi Kurdistan. Last week, Iraqi security forces took control of several cities, including the oil-rich Kirkuk, from Kurdish forces in a lightning assault. Shi ite fighters from the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), many of whom have been armed and trained by Iran, took part in the military action. Prior to the assault, Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards, traveled to Iraq s Kurdistan region to encourage Kurdish leaders to withdraw their forces, known as Peshmerga, from Kirkuk. Peshmerga commanders have accused Iran of orchestrating the operation, a charge Iranian officials have denied. Bakshi said on Wednesday that it was not clear when the other borders points between Iran and the Kurdistan region of Iraq would reopen. There is approximately 20 billion dollars of annual cross border trade through the Bashmagh border point Bakhshi said, according to IRIB. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"Nearly 30,000 Kurds displaced from city near Kirkuk: aid groups","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Nearly 30,000 Kurds have been displaced from a multi-ethnic city south of Kirkuk where sectarian tension flared after Iraqi forces took control of it, humanitarian organizations said on Wednesday. Most of those displaced from Tuz Khurmato are in need of urgent aid and staying in open shelters, officials from two international humanitarian organizations told Reuters. A third, Amnesty International, said on Tuesday that satellite images, videos, photos and dozens of testimonies indicate that hundreds of properties were looted, set on fire and destroyed in what appeared to be a targeted attack on predominantly Kurdish areas of the city of about 100,000 people. The Kurds fled after Kurdish Peshmerga fighters withdrew from the city on Oct. 16, as government forces and Iranian-backed Sh ite Popular Mobilisation moved in retaliation for an independence referendum held by the Kurdistan region authorities last month.   Tuz, located between oil-rich Kirkuk and Baghdad, is also inhabited by Sh ite Turkmen and Arabs.  Many of the people displaced are staying in the open and in public places, in schools, mosques or unfinished buildings,  Said Jennifer Connet, Oxfam s Program Manager.   They need emergency aid and also psychological support as many lost contact with children and relatives or witnessed traumatic incidents as they fled.  The official of the other organization confirmed that account but gave only as background information in order not compromise its access to the displaced people. At least 11 civilians were killed, Amnesty said, citing testimonies of people who escaped from the city who said they were attacked by Turkmen Shiite paramilitaries. Popular Mobilisation, a paramilitary force trained in Iran and supporting the Iraqi government in the region, was not involved in the violence that happened in the city, spokesman Karim Nuri told Reuters in Baghdad.   It was not forced displacement, our Kurdish brothers fled fearing reprisals,  he said, calling on government security to put an end to the unrest.  Problems happened between the different components, clans, families,  he said, refuting the political nature of the exodus.  The Kurds displaced from Tuz fled to the neighboring regions of Diyala, Sulaimaniya, and some to Erbil, further north, said Connet.  Humanitarian access to the displaced families is possible but going to Tuz is extremely difficult,  she said. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"Amid Brexit timetable confusion, UK aims for transition outline by early 2018","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain wants an outline agreement with the European Union by the end of March 2018 on the transitional arrangements that will apply temporarily after it leaves the bloc, Brexit minister David Davis said on Wednesday. Davis was addressing confusion caused by Prime Minister Theresa May this week over the exit timetable, but he then  stumbled into a new row about when lawmakers would get to vote on a final deal. His department later issued a clarification. May is seeking a so-called implementation period of around two years after Britain s exit from the EU in March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place.  I would be aiming to get certainly the outlines of it agreed, if we could, in the first quarter (of 2018) ... but it s a negotiation,  Davis told a parliamentary committee. Earlier this week May unnerved corporate executives, keen to know the trading rules they will face, by saying any transitional deal would not be agreed until the entire exit agreement was sealed, more likely towards the end of 2018. Last week EU leaders said at a summit that they would begin preparations to move into  phase two  of the Brexit negotiations in December, a step forward that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc. Davis said he expected to receive guidance from the EU on its approach to a transitional period by December, and that a deal allowing Britain to maintain conditions similar to the status quo would be struck quickly afterwards. However, having reassured businesses on the trade deal, Davis then angered lawmakers by suggesting the EU would push negotiations right up to the end of March 2019, meaning parliament might have to vote to approve the exit deal after Britain had already departed the bloc. Political opponents accused the government of trying to subvert democracy by not giving parliament a proper say. A spokeswoman for Davis  department later issued a clarification, saying the government was working to get the final deal agreed by October 2018 and that it intended to give lawmakers a vote before Britain left.  This morning the Secretary of State (Davis) was asked about hypothetical scenarios. (Chief EU negotiator) Michel Barnier has said he hopes to get the deal agreed by October 2018 and that is our aim as well,  the spokeswoman said.    May is already facing a rough ride in parliament on her minority government s key piece of Brexit legislation, which is on hold while ministers plow through hundreds of proposed amendments - some of which have enough support to inflict an embarrassing defeat.   This U-turn exposes another self-created shambles in government over Brexit,  Pat McFadden, an opposition lawmaker, said in a statement issued by the pro-European campaign group Open Britain.   Despite Davis s comments on the transition deal, Britain and the EU remain at odds on the overall timeline of the negotiations, which incorporate a withdrawal deal on the terms of the divorce, the transitional deal, and a future trade deal.  Britain wants to finish everything by the time it leaves in early 2019, while the EU thinks it could take until 2020 to tie up trade terms. Davis said he believed Britain would be able to seal a trade and customs arrangement by the end of the two-year exit process, adding that it was important to do so to avoid getting trapped in a protracted negotiation.  It s not a good position to get into to be still negotiating during such an arrangement,  Davis said.  If we were doing the negotiation during a period of transition, I suspect what we would get offered is a year extension and another year extension, each time paying a fee.  An EU official said on Tuesday that the EU will only negotiate on the details of a free trade deal after Britain has actually left in March 2019 because the EU s own laws do not allow it to negotiate trade agreements with its own members. Asked about this approach, Davis said a trade deal could be signed  a nanosecond  after Britain leaves, implying that he hoped for a more flexible approach from Brussels.

Cuban investigators say U.S. sonic attack allegations 'science fiction',"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban officials investigating U.S. complaints of attacks that sickened American diplomats in Havana said talk of acoustic strikes was  science fiction  and accused Washington of  slander  while it refused to cooperate fully with Cuba s enquiry. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he believed Havana was responsible for 24 diplomats being harmed. Washington expelled 15 Cuban diplomats and recalled more than half the U.S. diplomatic personnel from Havana earlier in October. While Cuba denounced the expulsions as  unjustified  and accused the United States of insufficient cooperation, three Interior Ministry officials and a doctor heading the inquiry provided more details in an interview in Havana on Sunday. Cuba had deployed about 2,000 security officials and experts, from criminologists to audiologists and mathematicians, to investigate the incidents after it became aware of them in February, the investigators said. The probe has not ended but so far has failed to uncover any evidence to corroborate allegations of attacks that the United States says have caused hearing loss, dizziness, fatigue and cognitive issues for diplomatic personnel who were based on the Communist-run island.  This is slander by the United States,  said Coronel Ramiro Ramirez, responsible for the security of diplomats in Cuba. Asked to respond to the Cuban officials  assertions, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the United States had reminded Cuba of its obligation to ensure the safety of U.S. diplomatic personnel and was continuing its investigation of the  attacks.  Washington officials have raised the possibility that sonic weapons were used to harm the diplomats, according to U.S. media reports. However, Cuban investigators denied such weapons could even have been used by third parties without affecting the health of others or attracting attention.  It s impossible. We are talking about science fiction,  said Lieutenant Colonel Jose Alazo, an expert in the criminal investigation unit of the Interior Ministry.  From a technical point of view, that argument is unsustainable.  The investigators said the United States had supplied 14 recordings of the sound it says the victims heard during the attacks and recorded, for example, on cellphones. These, however, did not contain anything that could damage human health, they concluded. The noises included the usual suburban sounds such as traffic, footsteps and voices. They were also characterized by a deviation peak of 7 kiloHertz (kHz) in the frequency band of 3 kHz, similar to the song of a cricket. An audible sound would need to be very loud - above 80 decibels or akin to a plane s engine   to have a health impact, they said. Yet only the victims heard the noise, not their families living in the same houses, or their neighbors.   We interviewed more than 300 people in the neighborhood, we also evaluated more than 30 medically, and no one heard these things,  Alazo said. Even if the U.S. diplomats  reports of loud sounds were misleading and the source of the attacks was infra- or ultrasonic and therefore inaudible to human ears, it would be hard to explain how it could go undetected, the Cuban investigators said.  You would need a source that could be seen from a satellite, it would be enormous,  said Dr Manuel Villar, an ear, nose and throat specialist. Finally, only two or three of the alleged victims had hearing problems, according to the U.S. information provided, whereas any kind of sonic attack would cause them in everyone, Villar said.  ANTI-CUBAN MAFIA  The United States has not formally accused Cuba of carrying out attacks, but Trump s comments further damaged relations between the old Cold War foes, which have rapidly deteriorated since he took office. Canada has said several Canadians had reported similar symptoms to the U.S. diplomats but it has not taken any action against Cuba and has said Cuba had been very cooperative with the investigation. [L2N1LB25E]  There is an anti-Cuban mafia in Miami and we are victims of their dirty work that involve certain people very close to the governing circles of the United States,  Ramirez said. Anti-Castro Cuban-Americans such as Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have guided Trump s policy on Cuba, including a partial rollback of the historic detente forged by Trump s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Washington insists its drawdown at its embassy was motivated by concern for the health of its diplomats.  The safety and wellbeing of American citizens is our top priority,  said Nauert. Investigators said U.S. actions did not add up with their accusations. More than 200 friends and relatives of U.S. diplomats based in Havana had asked for visas to visit them between February and July, despite the alleged attacks. The fact that the information the United States provided was late was a major obstacle to resolving the mystery, said the investigators, who declined to comment on the state of cooperation with Canada. So far, Washington had only officially reported 14 cases of alleged attacks to Cuba, compared with the 24 it had announced to the media, they said.  It will be impossible to resolve this investigation without more cooperation,  Ramirez said. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Italian government wins all five confidence votes on electoral law,"ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government won all five confidence votes it had called in the upper house of parliament on Wednesday on a new electoral law that looks unlikely to produce a clear-cut result at national elections due by next May. Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni called the five confidence motions to get the package approved quickly despite furious opposition from the anti-system 5-Star Movement and small leftist groups. All five of the motions, on different articles of the law, garnered comfortable majorities, even though many leftist allies had deserted coalition ranks. The bill has already passed through the lower house. A sixth vote on another article, but which was not the subject of a confidence motion, also passed. A final vote on the law is scheduled for Thursday morning. The proposed voting system favors parties that form pre-election coalitions and is backed by the largest parties within Italy s main centre-left and centre-right blocs. It will penalize groups that want to go it alone, such as 5-Star. However, opinion polls indicate that the system, which is a mix of proportional representation and first-past-the-post, will not throw up an obvious winner, with the vote split three ways between the left, right and 5-Star. A YouTrend survey for AGI newsagency said on Wednesday that none of the three main groups would get  anywhere near an absolute majority of seats .  It said the only way for this to happen would be for one bloc to win more than 40 percent of the vote, adding this would trigger a landslide. At present, none of the three political groups are seen winning support of more than 33 percent.   Five-Star has denounced the reform as  an institutional coup d etat  and senators from the group closed their eyes, or put on a blindfold as they voted  no  in the Senate. Hundreds of their supporters filled a central Rome square to denounce the bill, chanting  honesty  and waving party flags.  This is a fraudulent law for people here. It ignores voting rights and instead favors amalgamations and hookups,  said Rossano Cioccolini, 56, a worker from the northern city of Milan who took a day of holiday to join the Rome rally.  The largest party in Italy, 5-Star, will not get a look in because it doesn t accept alliances,  he added. The use of multiple confidence motions first in the lower house and now in the Senate has allowed the ruling centre-left coalition to truncate discussion on the bill and sidestep dozens of secret votes that could have allowed disillusioned lawmakers to betray their camp and ambush the bill. The government says the new law is needed to harmonize the electoral system for the upper and lower houses and reduce the risk of different majorities materializing in the two chambers. Previous attempts at reform this past year have all failed. Critics say the proposed law will enable political leaders to pack electoral lists across the country with their most avid supporters, stifling internal party debate.

"German police raid places linked to suspected Islamist militant, seize guns","BERLIN (Reuters) - German police seized large quantities of guns and ammunition in raids on four locations in Berlin linked to a 40-year-old German man with suspected Islamist ties, the Berlin prosecutor s office said on Wednesday.  The man, a German citizen with a Turkish background, had previously been convicted of weapons violations, and frequented a mosque which was under surveillance by state security, said prosecutor spokeswoman Silke Becker. Germany was hit by several Islamist militant attacks in 2016, including one in Berlin in December in which a Tunisian man shot dead a Polish lorry driver and then killed 11 more people by driving the stolen truck into a Christmas market. Germany s domestic intelligence agency has warned of further attacks by radicalised Muslims, given growing numbers of foreign fighters returning from war zones in Syria and Iraq. [L2N1MU194] Becker said an investigation had been under way since summer, but the raids were triggered by concerns that the suspect could harm his family rather than any specific indication of a planned terrorist attack.   It became clear that the suspect could have an Islamist background and Islamist connection in the broadest sense,  she said.  The suspect was due to go before a judge on Wednesday.

German president tells Putin: we need to work on our relationship,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday he was unhappy about the state of relations between Moscow and Berlin and that both sides needed to work to improve it. The first visit to Russia by a German president since 2010 happened as relations remain strained over Russia s 2014 annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russian separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine, as well as German accusations of Russian meddling in its politics, something Moscow denies.        It s essential that we use this opportunity for us as presidents to continue our dialogue to try to improve our bilateral relations, the state of which we can t be happy about,  Steinmeier told Putin at the start of talks.   I m convinced that we need to resist the alienation that has grown up between our countries in recent years and to do that we need to continue the dialogue and need long-term attempts from both sides to find solutions in crises.  Steinmeier, a Social Democrat who previously served as foreign minister, has long called for increased engagement with Moscow.  His party, which will go into opposition after four years in a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, wants a gradual easing of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow for its role in Ukraine. Steinmeier has also launched a disarmament initiative he hopes will spur Russia and the United States to embark on talks about reducing conventional weapons. Merkel, who has resisted moves to ease sanctions on Russia, is now trying to forge a three-way alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmental Greens.  A new Russia policy is unlikely to take shape until coalition negotiations begin in late November, but the Greens have generally backed a hard-line stance against Moscow for its annexation of Crimea and backing for the Syrian government.

"U.S., Gulf nations target Yemen terrorism financing","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and six Gulf nations have targeted 13 individuals they say are al Qaeda and Islamic State militants, in an action intended to disrupt terrorism financing in Yemen, U.S. administration officials said on Wednesday. Among those targeted are the militant group s chief financial officer in Yemen and head of assassinations in that country. The action puts those named on a business blacklist, which prohibits any financial actions and freezes their bank accounts. The nations joining the United States in the sanctions were Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar.  This is the largest ever multilateral designation in the Middle East,  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in Riyadh on Wednesday.  U.S. administration officials said this is the first joint sanctions action by Washington and Gulf states. The coordination was particularly significant because of a months-long diplomatic crisis between Qatar and several Gulf states. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar in June, accusing it of financing terrorism, meddling in the affairs of Arab countries and cozying up to their arch-rival Iran. The four countries have since added dozens of individuals and entities to a blacklist they say are associated with Qatar. One of the individuals on Wednesday s sanctions list, Abdula Wahaba al-Humayqani, and one of the entities, Rahmah Charitable, are part of that blacklist. Qatar s National Counter Terrorism Committee said in a statement it had strengthened its anti-terrorism finance laws.  Qatar is  committed to taking the necessary steps to defeat terrorism in all its forms, and will continue to work closely with the United States to impose sanctions on those who facilitate terrorist activity,  Major General Abdulaziz A. Al Ansari said in the statement. Qatar signed an agreement with the United States in July to increase cooperation on fighting terrorism finance, Qatar s counter-terrorism committee said. Peter Harrell a sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security, said cooperation between Gulf nations and Qatar was an important step.  Qatar has had a history of not being as robust on terrorism finance,  Harrell said.  It s heartening to see Qatar do this. It signals some ability to cooperate.  ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Wider Image: Mexico's indigenous Muslims in Maya heartland,"SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (Reuters) - A trip to Mexico s indigenous Maya heartland showed me how a vibrant Muslim community had sprung up in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. In the southern state of Chiapas, home to a lush mountainous landscape, I photographed members of a small Muslim community made up of hundreds of mostly indigenous Tzotzil men and women, many of whom converted to Islam from Catholic or other Christian denominations. The Muslim men here are distinguished by their prayer caps, or kufis, and the women by their hijabs which take the form of traditional Maya shawls. Locals say the conversions to Islam here began in the late 1980s, around the same time Mexico s Zapatista movement was gaining traction in Chiapas, as institutions including Christianity and capitalism came under increasing criticism. According to the last census, some 83 percent of Mexicans are Catholic. And although Muslims make up less than 1 percent of Mexico s 120 million population, a disproportionate number are indigenous clustered in and around San Cristobal de las Casas, a highland city in Chiapas that mixes both Maya and Spanish identity.  People gave us a weird look when we converted, they thought we were terrorists and were scared of us,  said Mustafa, a member of the nearby Ahmadia community.  But with the passage of time and our own actions, that opinion has changed,  he added. Umar, an indigenous former evangelical pastor, converted to Islam in the late 1990s and now serves as a bridge between local Christians and Muslims.  Ours is a monotheistic religion,  he said.  But we don t worship saints.  I later met 55-year-old Mohamed Amin who invited me to his home, offering me cookies and tea. He showed me where he prays five times a day and introduced me to his family. He asked me if I believed in God and I said no. That did not appear to bother him. He went on to explain the main reason behind his conversion to Islam.  I like to be clean and change my clothes,  he said.  This is a clean religion and that s what originally drew me to it.

Pinera holds lead in Chile's presidential race: poll,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean conservative presidential candidate Sebastian Pinera maintained his lead in voter preference ahead of the Nov. 19 election, and was seen beating his two closest rivals in a likely runoff, pollster CEP said on Wednesday. Pinera, a wealthy businessman and former president who governed from 2010 to 2014, was seen as stronger on crime and job creation than his seven rivals, in the latest poll. According to the poll, Pinera would win 32.8 percent of voters in the first round, up from 31.3 percent in CEP s last poll on Sept. 1. Center-left Senator Alejandro Guillier polled 13.8 percent of support, up from 14.5 percent previously, while leftist Beatriz Sanchez slipped about three percentage points to 7.0 percent. A Pinera win would please Chile s business community, which blames outgoing President Michelle Bachelet for sluggish economic growth in the world s top copper exporter.  But it would be considered a letdown for Bachelet s center-left base and a younger generation of urban Chileans, who hope for deeper changes to the country s longstanding, free-market economic model. The election is scheduled for Nov. 19, but if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, a second-round runoff between the top two candidates will be held in December. The poll of 1,424 Chileans conducted from Sept. 22 to Oct. 16 has a margin of error of three percentage points.  ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
EU lawmakers propose cuts in aid to Turkey tied to membership bid,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Parliament proposed on Wednesday to reduce EU funds to Turkey that are linked to its stalled bid to join the bloc, a call EU leaders are expected to back given a deteriorating relations with Ankara. Of the 217 million euros set to go to Turkey for reforms, infrastructure and agriculture in 2018, EU lawmakers agreed to cut up to 80 million euros. Of that, 50 million euros should be cut at first, with a further 30-million-euro reduction if Turkey does not improve its human rights record.  Turkey is not respecting freedom of speech, freedom of expression, human rights and is drifting further away from European democratic standards,  said centre-right lawmaker Siegfried Muresan, who led the budget discussions.   We cannot pretend we don t see that,  he told Reuters, emphasizing that the cuts would affect only the money earmarked for political reforms, not for infrastructure and farming. EU leaders must still sign off on the cuts but are expected to do so after an agreement at a summit last week to reduce the so-called pre-accession aid that is meant to help EU candidate countries prepare for membership. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who pressed for action on Turkey during her re-election campaign, described Turkish behavior on human rights as  unacceptable  in Brussels last Thursday. The European Parliament s decision came on the first day of the trial in Istanbul of 11 human rights activists in Turkey, including a German and a Swedish national. At the EU summit, Merkel said that the rule of law in Turkey was  moving in the wrong direction , in a reference to the large-scale purge that President Tayyip Erdogan has carried out following a failed coup attempt in July 2016. While the EU condemned the coup attempt, the scope of Erdogan s response, his detention of U.S. and European citizens including dual nationals, and his jibes at Germany  for what he has called  Nazi-like  behavior have soured EU-Turkey ties. Erdogan says the purges across society are necessary to maintain stability in a NATO country bordering Iraq and Syria. Launched in 2005 after decades of seeking the formal start of an EU membership bid, Ankara s membership negotiations were always sensitive for France and Germany because of Turkey s status as a large, mainly Muslim country. They are not officially frozen, despite calls from Austria to formally scrap Turkey s EU membership program. That is in part because the EU relies on Ankara to take in Syrian refugees in return for billions of euros of aid. But a majority of EU countries, led by Germany and the Netherlands, say it no longer makes sense to fund political reforms in Turkey when formal EU membership talks have not taken place since last year. Aside from money that the EU gives Turkey as part of its  2016 migration deal, Ankara was set to receive 4.4 billion euros from the EU between 2014 and 2020. Some EU governments want that money to go to non-governmental groups in Turkey, not to Ankara. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1

French opposition struggles to emerge from rubble of Macron victory,"PARIS (Reuters) - Battered and bruised from electoral defeat by Emmanuel Macron s centrists, France s Socialist Party is laying off most of its staff and selling its Paris base, while the centre-right Republicans limp on in search of a leader. Facing falling membership after winning just six percent of the vote in the presidential election, the centre-left party told staff on Wednesday it would have to fire most of them, days after its historic headquarters was put up for sale to raise funds. On the other side of the political divide, the conservative Republicans are leaderless and have struggled for months to decide whether to expel party members who have signed up to serve with Macron. The two parties ruled France for decades, but Macron s Republic on the Move has stolen the middle ground from under their feet.  Macron benefits from a large political space left vacant by the opposition,  said Vincent Thibault of Elabe pollsters.  He has to face very few attacks from the other parties.  Fewer lawmakers and local officials mean the Socialist Party s income has fallen to 8 million euros ($9.42 million) a year from 28 million previously. Party treasurer Jean-Francois Debat told Reuters around 60 of 97 staff would have to go.     While the Republicans are the largest opposition group in the lower house of parliament and hold a majority in the senate, they are in barely better shape. For the past five months they have struggled to stem Macron s poaching of their top officials, or to oppose economic policies that mirror their own. In the latest of several meetings on membership, the party decided in principle on Tuesday to expel Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and other ministers serving in Macron s government.     But having failed to gather enough officials at the meeting, they were forced to postpone the actual decision for a week, drawing scorn from critics.  It s grotesque,  Sebastien Lecornu, a junior minister and one of those facing expulsion, told Le Parisien daily.  They are punishing us for backing reforms that are useful to the country ... the right is committing suicide.       The far left and far right are also struggling to mount a credible opposition to 39-year-old Macron. The far-right National Front, weakened by its own divisions, has become close to inaudible. Its leader Marine Le Pen had the worst ratings on record for France 2 television s top political show last week, with only 1.7 million viewers. The far-left France Insoumise has been more vocal, and polls show it is seen as the strongest opponent. But it has struggled to get voters out on the streets against Macron s reforms and surveys show it is regarded more as a protest movement. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1

Catalan separatist leader turns down chance to talk to Spanish Senate,"MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont has turned down an invitation to address Spain s Senate on Catalonia s bid for independence on Thursday, a spokesman for the regional government said. Earlier on Wednesday, aides had indicated that Puigdemont, who is the region s president, would attend the session in Madrid.  But a spokesman for Puigdemont said later the Catalan leader would not do so because the Spanish government had already announced its intention to impose direct control on the autonomous region to counter its independence drive.

Russia frees two pro-Kiev Crimea Tatar leaders from jail,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has freed two prominent Crimean Tatar activists opposed to Moscow s annexation of Ukraine s Crimea region, their lawyer said on Wednesday. Ukraine s leader thanked Turkey s president for helping broker the release. Ilmi Umerov, deputy head of the Crimean Tatars  semi-official Mejlis legislature before it was suspended by Moscow, was sentenced last month by a Russian court to two years in jail for separatism. Ahtem Chiygoz, another Crimean Tatar leader, was sentenced at the same time to eight years for stirring anti-Russian protests.  What everyone had been waiting for so long, has happened,  a defense lawyer for the Crimean Tatars, Nikolai Polozov, wrote on his Facebook page.  Two more hostages, two Ukrainian political prisoners have gained their freedom.  There was no immediate confirmation of their release from  Russian authorities. The Tatars, a mainly Muslim Turkic community that makes up about 15 percent of Crimea s population, have largely opposed Russian rule in the peninsula and say the 2014 annexation was illegal, a view supported by the West. They suffered mass deportation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Nariman Dzhelyalov, a Crimean Tatar leader, told Reuters the two, Ilmi Umerov and Ahtem Chiygoz, had landed in Turkey.  This is the result of Turkey s talks with Russia with Ukraine s participation,  he told Reuters.  After Erdogan s visit to Kiev, representatives of Russian competent bodies turned up at Umerov s house in Crimea to agree the terms (of the release).  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko thanked Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan for his role in helping free the pair. Moscow says the overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to join Russia in a proper and fair referendum. Western governments and human rights groups had alleged the two Crimean Tatar leaders were imprisoned for speaking out against Russia s annexation of Crimea, and pressed Moscow to release them. Umerov s supporters said at the time that the two-year jail term handed to him actually amounted to a death penalty for the  elderly man who suffers from Parkinson s disease. Russian officials denied the prosecutions were politically-motivated. A U.N. human rights report said last month that Russia had committed grave human rights violations in Crimea, including its imposition of citizenship and deporting of prisoners. Moscow said it deemed those allegations  groundless .    ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Bosnian pensioners stage street protests for pension rise,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Thousands of pensioners from across Bosnia s Bosniak-Croat Federation, most of whom live on the edge of poverty, took to the streets in Sarajevo on Wednesday to protest for a rise in pensions and better social and health care. Out of about 410,000 pensioners living in the Bosnian region, nearly two-thirds live on minimum payments of 326 Bosnian marka ($196) a month, while the average pension amounts to 370 marka compared to an average wage of 870 marka.  With five pensioners to every six employed people in the Bosnian region, the government, which has yet to come up with an overall reform plan for the pension system, is struggling to make payments on time. Some pension fund officials say the system survives on low pensions, which are the lowest in the Balkans. The pensioners, some carrying placards reading  Stop the Robbery  and  Give Us back Our Dignity , called for a 10 percent rise in payments which have not been increased since 2014.  Pensions are low, medicines expensive and we have to pay electricity, water, telephone,  said Alosman Halic from the northern town of Lukavac, who has worked for 45 years and receives 326 marka pension.   After we pay our bills, there is nothing left for us,  says his wife Isura, adding they could not survive without help from their children. Youth unemployment is high at more than 60 percent, scores of young people having left the Balkan country which was left  impoverished by the 1992-95 war and is riven by political and ethnic divisions.  On Tuesday, the Federation government adopted a new draft pension law, envisaging a 10 percent rise of pensions for some categories and five percent increase for other categories. The law now needs to be approved by the region s parliament, where the passage of laws is often blocked over political bickering.  The situation is also grave in the Serb Republic, Bosnia s other autonomous region, where the level of employed is almost equal with that of retired people. Earlier this month, the government there decided to raise the minimum pension to 360 marka.  ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"No rest, high tempo - energetic Macron keeps Elysee agenda ticking","PARIS (Reuters) - From text messages at 2 a.m. to clockwork meetings and tight deadlines, 39-year-old Emmanuel Macron is shaking up how the French presidency is run, raising the tempo and stretching the limits of the largely youthful team around him. France s political magazines are full of snippets every week about the inner workings of Macron s Elysee, whether the comings and goings of his rescue dog Nemo or details of messages sent to the foreign minister in the dead of night. But foreign diplomats dealing with the administration also describe a different pace and style of work, saying the young president, with a background in investment banking and civil service, has injected fresh elan into the role. Half a dozen senior European envoys, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, expressed similar views on the sharpness, energy and openness of Macron and his team, whether on specific policy discussions or wider bilateral issues. While they were quick to emphasize that former President Francois Hollande also had a strong command of the files and a ready wit, Macron s focus, personal engagement and trust in those around him has quickened the rhythm, they said.  There is undoubtedly a change in pace,  said the ambassador of one northern European country.  It s not just in terms of ambition, but actually engagement. They are very open, they want us involved, they want us there in meetings.  Another described Macron s team as bringing a level of analysis and planning to the table that is more in tune with the worlds of investment banking and finance than politics. On EU policy in particular   which Macron has made a priority, delivering big-picture speeches in Athens and at the Sorbonne   he has established a tight group of advisers and envoys around him, combining youth and experience. As well as Philippe Etienne, 61, the former French ambassador to the EU, there is 36-year-old Clement Beaune, a graduate of the elite ENA school who was part of Macron s En Marche! Movement from the beginning and is now Europe adviser. Philippe Leglise-Costa, the new representative in Brussels, and Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau are also part of the mix. The question is whether the new energy and approach of the  Macronistas    which some French media have described as exhausting to the point of collapse   can bear fruit or will prove more style than substance. Some of the early signs are positive, particularly on Europe policy. This week, EU labor ministers agreed to amend the rules on so-called  posted workers , a divisive issue Macron had pushed since taking office in May. The policy allows EU employees to work elsewhere in the bloc on terms set in their home countries, which countries like France that offer strong worker protections say lets employers get around labor laws by importing workers. The ministers agreed to shorten the period of such postings. Last month, with Elysee input, Germany s Siemens and France s Alstom agreed to merge their rail operations, creating a European champion to compete with China. The same week, France agreed to cede control of shipyard STX to Italy s Fincantieri, another sensitive move shaped by the Elysee. The area where Macron s high-tempo agenda is proving less successful so far is euro zone financial reform. The president had hoped to work with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to overhaul monetary union, including establishing a separate budget for the 19 countries that use the euro.  The results of Germany s election last month have made that more difficult, with both Merkel s likely coalition partners, the liberal FDP party and the Greens, opposed to a euro zone budget or any debt-sharing. Macron acknowledged some of those obstacles at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels last week, but said he remained committed to the budget goal, saying it would emerge eventually.

BBC complains to U.N. over alleged harassment by Iran of its Persian staff,"LONDON (Reuters) - The BBC said on Wednesday it had filed an urgent complaint to the United Nations after Iran began a criminal investigation into 152 BBC Persian staff and contributors, accusing them of   conspiracy against national security  in Iran and abroad. Iran has frozen the assets of BBC Persian staff, meaning they cannot inherit family assets and preventing them and their families from selling assets, such as property or cars, in Iran. All individuals on the list work, or have worked, for BBC Persian, part of the BBC World Service. A Reuters correspondent who was working for the BBC until 2015 was also on the list.  This is the latest in a sustained campaign of harassment and persecution which is designed to pressure journalists against continuing their work for the BBC,  Britain s publicly funded broadcaster said in a statement. Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC, added in the statement:  This is not just a campaign against BBC Persian staff but against fundamental human rights, and the BBC calls on the government of Iran to end this legal action immediately.  Iran accused the BBC of inciting unrest after the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009 and said its journalists were broadcasting against the national interests of the Islamic Republic. The following year it banned Iranians from contact with dozens of foreign organizations, including the BBC, which it said were seeking to topple the Islamic theocracy. The corporation said harassment had been going on since Iran s 2009 presidential election and included staff being attacked in the press and on social media with defamatory allegations.  Many staff had been subjected to fake news accusing them of sexual impropriety or sexual acts which are illegal in Iran, including those which attract the death penalty. The BBC said it had filed the complaint with David Kaye, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. BBC Persian broadcasts news in Persian to Iran and the Persian speaking world from London on TV, radio and online, reaching an estimated audience of 18 million a week.

The Swiss government gave its approval to the arrangement at a meeting on Wednesday, with the mandate covering consular services for both nations.  Switzerland has a long history of representing foreign interests whereby it covers partial consular services and sometimes diplomatic tasks for countries that have broken off relations, if requested by the states in question,  the government said.

"Philippines, Russia sign two military deals","MANILA (Reuters) - Thousands of assault rifles and helmets were among the military gear Russia donated to the Philippines in a bid to widen its arms market in Southeast Asia at a time when Manila is seeking to diversify weapons systems, officials said on Wednesday. Manila received about 5,000 Kalashnikov rifles, 5,000 steel helmets, about a million rounds of ammunition for the rifles and 20 army trucks in a ceremony attended by President Rodrigo Duterte, who also toured one of five visiting Russian warships. The gift came a day after Russia and the Philippines signed two military pacts, including a sales contract with Rosoboronexport, a state-owned vendor of Russian defense equipment.    We are looking at acquiring some equipment for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, but there are no specifics yet,  Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told Reuters.  We are still discussing.  Lorenzana said the Rosoboronexport contract was not a sales deal but signaled the Philippines  intention to acquire small arms, vehicles and special equipment for disaster operations. But the Philippines  biggest source of arms, the United States, was not worried at the prospect of equipment donated by its rivals China and Russia.  I don t attach very much significance to it, some trucks or guns being dropped off to a country that s fighting terrorists right now,  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on the plane to Bangkok.  It s a sovereign decision by the Philippines,  he added.  So it s not a big issue...other nations are coming to their help.  The United States and China dominate regional arms trade.  Since 2000, the United States has donated close to $1 billion worth of military equipment to the Philippines, ranging from surveillance planes, drones and boats to small arms.  China, which promised to donate a third shipment of small arms after a meeting on Wednesday between Lorenzana and his Chinese counterpart, General Chang Wanquan, has already given the Philippines about $7 million in small arms.   The deals with the Philippines will allow Russia to expand its arms market in the region, said another senior Philippine official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.  The Philippines is now open to buying Russian arms as Manila cultivates closer ties with Moscow, he added, particularly as the military looks to diversify its equipment, reining in costs while maintaining quality.  Moscow has been offering to sell arms to us since the mid-1990s and they are willing to barter guns for bananas,  he said, adding that Russia was selling fighters, helicopters and submarines to the Philippines.

Former Turkish minister launches party to challenge Erdogan,"ANKARA (Reuters) - A prominent Turkish nationalist politician and former minister announced on Wednesday she was forming a new party which could pose a significant challenge to President Tayyip Erdogan in elections due within two years. Former interior minister Meral Aksener, who unsuccessfully opposed Erdogan s drive for greater presidential powers in a referendum last April, said Turkey needed change after nearly 15 years of rule by his AK Party. Her Iyi Parti (Good Party) is seen by many in Turkey as potentially one of the strongest challengers to Erdogan in presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for 2019, but it starts out with only a fraction of the AK Party s support. Just five members of the 550-seat parliament have joined the new party, although pollsters say it could win over supporters of several parties including the conservative and Islamic-rooted AK Party as well as secular or nationalist groups.  Turkey and its people are tired, the state is worn down, and public order is unraveling. There is no way other than the changing of the political atmosphere,  Aksener said at a ceremony in Ankara to mark the launch of her party.  We are that way out, you are that way out. That road is the 80 million strong Turkish nation  she said, standing in front of the logo of her party - a yellow sun shining in a blue sky.  Our people are clearly saying they want ... a new government.  Aksener was expelled last year from the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), the smallest of three opposition parties in parliament, after launching a failed bid to unseat party leader Devlet Bahceli, whose support helped Erdogan to a narrow victory in a referendum that expanded his authority. Since her expulsion, the 61-year old Aksener has become one of the most prominent voices in the country, frequently criticizing Erdogan and the government. The Iyi Party could take more than a tenth of the AK Party support, which stands at over 40 percent, said Hakan Bayrakci of SONAR pollsters. It could also erode the support base of nationalist MHP and the secularist CHP parties, he said.   Meral Aksener s party will lead to big changes in Turkey s political atmosphere,  Bayrakci told Reuters.  This may not be immediate, but in three to five months, I believe this shift will be visible.  Erdogan s AK Party won just under 50 percent of votes in the last parliamentary election, in November 2015, and he has told supporters it is aiming for more than half the votes in 2019. Mehmet Ali Kulat from polling company Mak Danismanlik, which is seen as close to the AK Party, said the Iyi Party currently had the support of around 5 percent of voters.   It looks like Aksener s party can get votes from angry voters,  Kulat said.  Their real strength will come out in the long term.  Aksener said many members of her party wanted her to stand as its presidential candidate in the 2019 election, and criticized what she described as an erosion of rights in Turkey.  Democracy is under threat and the government s justice is above all else. It is evident that society is at a political standstill,  Aksener said. Since a failed military coup last year, in which more than 240 people were killed, Turkish authorities have detained more than 50,000 people and suspended 150,000 people including teachers, soldiers, journalists and lawyers. Aksener said her party aimed to raise the average length of education in Turkey from seven years to 11 years, and promised to bring Turkey into the world s top 20 countries for education. It currently lies around 50th in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). In previous weeks, several members from the MHP and the secular main opposition Republican People s Party (CHP) have quit their parties to join Aksener, who has said her party s doors were open to anyone  willing to walk with their cause .  We have hopes and dreams. We want a rich Turkey, we have power. We want a just Turkey and we have that power. We want a free Turkey and we have our rights,  she said.

Ukraine to ramp up health spending after anti-corruption push,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine plans a 12 percent increase in health spending next year to exploit reforms passed last week to raise standards and crack down on corruption in hospitals and surgeries, government ministers told Reuters. Ukrainians die earlier than most Europeans and patients often bribe doctors for treatment or medicine. Kiev s Western backers see healthcare reforms as a test for Ukraine s push for closer ties to the European Union, away from Russia. New legislation will create a national insurance system that pays doctors by the number of patients they have. Hospitals will be paid for services through the new system, rather than receiving lump sums from regional administrations as is now.   It also allows patients to choose their doctor for the first time, rather than being tied to the doctor where their residence is registered, a move the government says will encourage medics to improve and gives them less scope to demand backhanders. Health Minister Ulana Suprun said that patients  mindsets will also need to change.   People in Ukraine think that paying the doctor cash, under the table, is somehow a  thank you  for the services that are supposed to be provided to them at no cost,  she said in an interview.  There needs to be a big cultural change as well, so that we teach people that they re not supposed to do that.   She cited a survey by the national anti-corruption bureau which found 65 percent of Ukrainians had come across corruption in the past year, of which 68 percent was in healthcare.  And Finance Minister Oleksandr Danylyuk told Reuters in an email Ukraine will hike health spending by 12 percent to 114 billion hryvnia ($4.28 billion) in 2018, and is ready for a further increase later because the reform is a government priority. Ukraine has emerged from a steep recession caused by the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of a Russian-backed separatist insurgency in 2014.  But the economy is still propped up by a $17.5 billion aid program from the International Monetary Fund that is conditional on reforms and progress in tackling corruption. With no end in sight to the conflict in the Donbass, defense spending accounts for at least 5 percent of GDP.  The ministry of finance is one of our biggest supporters,  Suprun said of the planned rise in spending.   They re big supporters of what we re doing because they re finally going to be able to follow the money all the way down to a patient. Whereas now we hand money out to hospitals and we don t really know what is done with it at that point.   A U.S.-born doctor, Suprun moved to Ukraine in the early days of the Maidan demonstrations in November 2013, and wound up treating the gunshot wounds of protesters in the final days of pro-Kremlin leader Viktor Yanukovich s rule.   The reforms went through 893 amendments while Suprun says she was targeted by a smear campaign, including by some who  questioned whether she had faked her diploma.  The new legislation is just the first step, she says,  because reform never is easy. People don t want to change. They re used to the system that there is, and there s a lot of people making a lot of money off of this.   Healthcare professionals told Reuters they welcomed the reforms.  Oleksandr Ivanko, chief doctor at the Kiev Municipal Clinical Hospital, hoped doctors  salaries would improve  because you cannot motivate them and demand anything while paying a minimum or even humiliating salary.

"Troops and strays, the only signs of life in ruined Marawi","MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - With vehicles crushed and overturned and buildings reduced to skeletons of mangled steel and rubble, the Philippine city of Marawi resembles the aftermath of a war that lasted years, rather than months. Except for small clusters of troops dotted amid the ruins and skinny cats and dogs scavenging for food, the heart of Marawi is a ghost town, all but destroyed by the Philippines  biggest and fiercest urban battle in recent history. Hundreds of rebels claiming allegiance to Islamic State seized large areas of the city of 200,000 people in May and clung on through unrelenting government air strikes and artillery bombardments, right until the last remaining gunmen were killed three days ago. The military escorted media on Wednesday through the ravaged streets of the once picturesque lakeside town, showing for the first time the front lines of a devastating conflict that has stoked fears of Islamic State s extremist agenda taking root in the region. The scale of the damage was stark as a convoy of vans carrying reporters and cameramen followed an army truck through one district after another, stopping off at key intersections  recently cleared of unexploded munitions and booby traps.  Wide boulevards in the city were lined by crumbling homes and shop fronts missing higher floors, with fragments of chairs, children s toys and household appliances wedged into piles of crumbled concrete. Tattered pieces of clothing poking above banks of rubble provided the only color in the mass of gutted grey buildings blackened by smoke. Vans, pickup trucks and cars were turned over, coated in rust or torn apart by bomb blasts. The militants  planning, stockpiling of weapons and their combat capability stunned government forces, who had to fight street by street to take back the city and were often pinned down by snipers and homemade bombs.  At first our forces cannot press them, they moved from one building to the next. Our concept was to restrict them - it took time, but we constricted them,  said Lieutenant Colonel Sam Yunque, a special forces commander deployed in Marawi since the beginning of the conflict.  We innovated to suppress their techniques. They were not better than us, that s why they lost.  The Philippines announced the end of combat operations in Marawi City on Monday after troops killed 42 remaining militants, including some foreign fighters. More than 1,100 people, including 165 troops and 45 civilians, died in the conflict. The government has said the rest were militants. Senior officers said they took pains to protect the multitude of mosques in what is the only designated Islamic City in the mainly Catholic Philippines. Although many escaped the pounding of daily air strikes, domes and walls were peppered with holes from heavy machine gun fire as troops sought to flush out rebels hiding within. Earlier on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis praised Filipino soldiers for defeating the militants without attracting allegations of human rights violations. The United States provided critical tactical intelligence in the Marawi combat operation, deploying surveillance planes and drones, thermal imaging and eavesdropping equipment. The walls were blasted away at Marawi s police headquarters where the armory was looted, and in the adjacent jail where more than 100 prisoners were freed. Close by, a mosque minaret had fallen into a mash of metal and rock. Behind it was a lone, leafless tree with only a few branches left. The militants smashed through thick layers of concrete to turn drainage channels into trenches, doubling as tunnels for fighters to move between buildings and elude surveillance drones and army snipers. Rebel-held buildings were covered with graffiti, including one of an arrow through a heart, with the message  I love ISIS , an acronym for Islamic State. But there was no love for the rebel alliance among the hundreds of jubilant soldiers at send-off ceremonies held this week as troops gradually return home. Colonel Corleto Vinluan, the commander of joint special operations, described the enemy as  rats . He said the military had gained valuable experience in urban combat and chose a strategy that took time, but ultimately paid off.   We couldn t just enter the area, it was very big, we did not know where the leaders were, we had to surround them and the area became smaller. It was that time when we really took control,  Vinluan told Reuters.  We didn t expect they ll last that long, their ammunition their firearms and their food. We learned a lot from this event, we adjusted our strategies.  They were tough fighters, some of them, but not all.   ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
China unveils new leadership line-up with no clear successor to Xi,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party broke with recent precedent on Wednesday, unveiling a new leadership line-up without a clear successor to President Xi Jinping, who has become arguably the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Xi led his team in order of rank on to a stage at Beijing s Great Hall of the People, overlooking Tiananmen Square, culminating a week-long party conclave at which he laid out his  vision for an increasingly prosperous China confident of its place on the world stage.  Apart from Xi, Premier Li Keqiang was the only one to retain his spot amid sweeping changes on the Politburo Standing Committee. There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of his customary second five years in power, which began on Wednesday. All seven Standing Committee members are men in their 60s and, for the first time, none was born before China s 1949 Communist revolution. The make-up of the committee, which has ultimate control over the world s second-largest economy, appeared to be a compromise to include a blend of Xi allies and those considered loyal to party elders, including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, former presidents whose networks still wield influence. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, said Xi appeared to have traded securing favorable amendments to the constitution in exchange for a compromise on the make-up of the Standing Committee, a line-up he likened to a  team of rivals . The member considered closest to Xi is Li Zhanshu, who has often accompanied Xi on overseas trips in a chief-of-staff-style role as the head the party s General Office.  Li, who is not related to the premier, was named the third-ranked member, meaning he will most likely assume the role of head of the largely rubber-stamp parliament. That will not be confirmed until parliament meets in March. Xi had already strengthened his hand considerably ahead of the announcement, with his political theory and  Belt and Road  infrastructure-led development strategy put into the party constitution. He was named the party s  core  last year. Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua and Chongqing party boss Chen Miner had been previously seen as prominent contenders to succeed Xi among the party s so-called sixth generation of leaders but were not included in the Standing Committee. Instead, both were named to the wider 25-member Politburo, a rung below the Standing Committee.  He s consolidated his power without making unnecessary problems for himself,  said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.   The costs of keeping Wang Qishan or getting Chen Miner were too high. He didn t need to do it.  Wang, who led Xi s sweeping anti-graft campaign and was considered China s second most-powerful politician, is above retirement age; Chen was comparatively junior.  While the Standing Committee bears the hallmarks of compromise, the new Politburo is stacked with more than a dozen Xi allies, including Chen, Beijing party boss Cai Qi, economic adviser Liu He and Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to become Xi s chief of staff as director of the party s General Office.  Xi has managed to put a lot of his own people there, as much as possible,  said Bo Zhiyue, a New Zealand-based expert on Chinese politics.  Most of Xi s close associates are too junior to be put into the Politburo Standing Committee right away.  Blanket state media coverage made no mention of factional politics or alliances, while an editorial on the official People s Daily s WeChat account hailed the new seven-man line-up as a  dream team  to lead China into its  new era . Xi, who has sought to revitalize the Communist Party s role across Chinese society, made no mention of who his successor might be as he introduced his new Standing Committee at a media event broadcast live around the country. His remarks were translated consecutively into English. Xi did not take questions, but said the party had weathered trials and tribulations.

China's new Politburo Standing Committee lineup,"(Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party on Wednesday unveiled its core decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, headed by President Xi Jinping. Here is the list of the new committee, all men, by order of seniority: - Xi Jinping, 64, is widely seen as China s most powerful leader since Chairman Mao Zedong. He was once viewed as a drab  princeling  child of the elite. But since soaring to power in 2012, Xi has centralized authority under his own leadership with a signature anti-graft battle. His political theory -  Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era  - was written into the Party constitution on Tuesday.  - Li Keqiang, 62, as premier has overseen China s economy for the last five years. Li s policies have sought to spur entrepreneurship and innovation, but he has been increasingly overshadowed by Xi, who has thrown his weight behind reforms to make state sector firms  stronger, better and bigger  and to manage financial stability.  - Li Zhanshu, 67, heads the party s General Office. He worked his way up from Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, and graduated from Hebei Normal University. A former governor of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one-time party boss of the southwestern province of Guizhou, Li Zhanshu is considered one of Xi s closest advisors and often accompanies him on overseas trips. Their friendship dates back to their days working together in Hebei in the 1980s. - Wang Yang, 62, is a vice premier with an economic portfolio and a former party chief of Guangdong province, an export powerhouse, where he served from 2007-2012. Born into a poor rural family in eastern Anhui province, Wang went to work in a factory at age 17 to support his family after his father died. Concerned about the impact of three decades of rapid development, he lobbied for social and political reform. However, he backed down after drawing criticism from party conservatives.     - Wang Huning, 62 this month, was a top policy researcher for the party under former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, a position he has kept under Xi as head of the Central Policy Research Office. Wang coined the  Three Represents  and  Scientific Outlook of Development  - respectively Jiang and Hu s contributions to party thought, as well as the  Chinese Dream , Xi s own vision. Wang was formerly an academic at Shanghai s Fudan University, specializing first in international relations and then law. He is also considered one of Xi s closest advisors. - Zhao Leji, 60, was also named the Chinese Communist Party s new anti-corruption chief on Wednesday. He was named vice governor of the northwestern province of Qinghai in 1994 at age 37. Zhao spent 29 years in Qinghai before being picked by Xi to serve as party boss of Shaanxi province, in the northwest, in 2007. Both Zhao and Xi are natives of Shaanxi. Zhao heads the powerful organization department, which oversees personnel decisions, and is a Politburo member. He has a degree in philosophy from Peking University.  - Han Zheng, 63, is party chief of Shanghai, China s financial hub, where he has spent his entire career. Han was briefly promoted from Shanghai mayor after the then-party boss was sacked amid a corruption scandal in 2006. He resumed his mayoral role as Xi Jinping and then Yu Zhengsheng - currently the party s fourth-ranked leader - became party chief. Han became Shanghai party boss in 2012.

Philippines' Duterte says he's been 'demonized' over drugs war,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday defended his bloody war on drugs, telling Southeast Asian lawyers he had been  demonized  and denying allegations of state-sponsored killings of drug dealers and users. Duterte s crackdown has caused international alarm, and domestic polls have shown growing scepticism about the 16-month old campaign that has killed thousands of mostly urban, poor Filipinos. His government s human rights record has been strongly criticized by Western countries, and is one of the issues U.S. President Donald Trump plans to raise on a visit to Manila next month to attend a regional summit.    I know that I have been demonized,  Duterte said, invoking God and his oath as a lawyer as he offered his assurance.  The extra judicial tag that has been placed on me is simply not true.  He was speaking to members of the ASEAN Law Association, attending a commemorative session in Manila, the host of this year s activities of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations grouping. Duterte spoke for more than an hour after delivering a prepared speech, as he defended the campaign and explained why many of those killed were from among the poor.     He used United Nations pamphlets to describe how different types of illegal drugs, including the highly addictive methamphetamine, or  shabu , could trigger aggressive behavior among users.  I do not deny that there were people killed in that campaign,  he added.  But why were they killed? Because a  shabu  user, a lieutenant of the  shabu  syndicate, always has a gun and this was my experience when I was mayor. They always fight it out.  During his 22 years as mayor of the southern city of Davao, Duterte estimated 600 drug suspects had been killed in police encounters. His anti-narcotics crackdown has come under unprecedented scrutiny following the high-profile Aug. 16 killing of a 17-year-old student, among the 90 people killed in less than a week of intensified police raids. A recent poll showed fewer Filipinos believe the official stance of the Philippine National Police that those killed in anti-drugs operations had refused to go quietly.  When I say,  I will kill you if you destroy my country,  and  I will kill you if you destroy the young of my country,  I am asking everybody to find me a fault in those two statements,  Duterte told the audience.

"In Myanmar's Rakhine, aid workers blocked from entering Muslim camp amid tension","YANGON/SITTWE (Reuters) - Buddhists in Myanmar on Wednesday blocked aid workers from visiting a camp for displaced Muslims in the central part of Rakhine State, where the United Nations fears the spread of violence that has already displaced hundreds of thousands. More than 600,000 of Myanmar s largely stateless Rohingya minority have crossed to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a military crackdown beset by allegations of killings, rape and arson by security forces. The U.N. has called the army operation  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar has denied the majority of allegations and said it will accept the return of those who can prove they are residents.  A regional administrator and an activist told Reuters a group of about 10 Myanmar nationals working for U.S.- and Britain- based charity Relief International (R.I.) was forced to turn back when residents of the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine community staged a protest in the town of Myebon. Reuters reported this month that activists among the town s Buddhist majority had stepped up efforts to segregate Buddhists and Muslims, instructing Rakhines not to trade with Muslims, for fear of militancy. Deliveries of food aid to Myebon s Muslims have been delayed and only allowed in after inspections by Buddhist community representatives.  The R.I. group were trying to go to the camp and the locals blocked the way,  said Tin Shwe, the town s administrator, adding that the aid workers returned to their office after Wednesday s incident. Samir Maleh, country director for Relief International in Myanmar, declined to comment on the incident. Leaders of the Rakhine Buddhist community have long bristled at international agencies and NGOs whom they accuse of favoring the Rohingya with their support. Aid workers and U.N. staff have told Reuters they fear enforced segregation may trigger further displacement in Rakhine, either through fresh violence or as Muslims flee on boats to Malaysia and Thailand, fuelling a new stage of crisis in the Bay of Bengal. Wednesday s incident was the latest example of the numerous obstacles that humanitarian organizations face in Rakhine State, said Pierre Peron, a spokesman for the United Nations  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).    Of course we respect that any group should be able to exercise their rights of freedom of speech and peaceful assembly, but the simple fact here is that life-saving aid is being blocked from reaching vulnerable people who desperately need it, including children and the elderly.  About 3,000 Muslims - including Rohingya and those accepted as Myanmar citizens - have been confined to a camp for displaced people in Myebon since communal violence swept Rakhine in 2012. Photos posted on social media site Facebook on Wednesday showed about two dozen women sitting down to block a small street, with a smaller group of men standing behind. Khin Thein, a leader of a regional branch of the Arakan Women s Network, said her group joined the protest after authorities told the community the NGO would provide education about gender-based violence, hygiene and sanitation to Muslims.  They have food, they have shelter to live,  she told Reuters.  We can t accept these kinds of excess things for them. We will not allow them to pass through our township. We already protested several times in the past. We have suspicions about them. We don t trust foreigners, international people.  ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
A poet in the dock as Israel hunts 'lone wolf' assailants online,"REINEH, Israel (Reuters) - A week after Dareen Tatour posted a poem on Facebook entitled  Resist, my people, resist,  Israeli police came to her home in the middle of the night and arrested her.  The Arab-Israeli poet will hear next Monday whether she will be jailed on charges of incitement to violence and supporting a terrorist group. The average sentence in similar cases is nine months, though the maximum term she could face is five years. Israeli prosecutors say Tatour, 35, issued a call to violence by reading her poem as a soundtrack to a video she posted on Facebook and YouTube, showing masked Palestinian youths throwing stones and fire-bombs at Israeli soldiers. Posted as a wave of Palestinian street attacks began in the region, it reads:  Resist, my people, resist them /Resist the settlers  robbery/ And follow the caravan of martyrs.     They didn t understand my poem,  Tatour told Reuters in an interview at her home in Reineh in northern Israel, where she is under house arrest.  There is no call for violence. There is a struggle, they cast it as violent.   The point of the poem was to say  enough . A person feels for their people. I am of the Palestinian people. I live this struggle and I spoke it through the poem,  she said.     Tatour s case has become a cause celebrate for freedom of speech advocates. It has also drawn attention to advanced technology used by Israeli security agencies to trawl through social media to identify and arrest users suspected of incitement to violence or planning attacks.  Critics say the practise is flawed because people have been detained purely on the basis that they may commit a crime, without having done so. Israel rejects the criticism, saying security concerns are paramount. Some Western intelligences agencies use similar predictive policing methods to identify individuals of interest but experts say Israel seems unique in using them as a basis for detention. Since October 2015, 51 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian stabbing, shootings and car-rammings. Palestinian leaders say the assailants are reacting to Israel s occupation of territories Palestinians want for a state.  Some 270 Palestinians have also been killed in the past two years. Israel says at least 180 of those were killed carrying out attacks, nearly all  lone wolf  assailants, while others were killed in clashes.     Online incitement is the fuel igniting the terrorists in this wave of violence,  Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked told a Tel Aviv University cyber conference in June.  Israeli prosecutors say Tatour is also implicated by other posts than the poem that appeared on Oct. 3, 2015.   The attempt to present her as an artist, a poet, who merely wrote something innocent distorts the truth,  a Justice Ministry official said.   An expert on Arabic translation told her trial that  Martyr  to an Israeli means a terrorist. To a Palestinian it means victim   any Palestinian killed in the conflict with Israel, as a bystander or assailant. Indictments for online incitement   most of those charged are young Palestinians   have tripled in Israel since 2014, the Justice Ministry says.  In the occupied West Bank, prosecutions by Israel s military have also increased, according to a report by the Military Advocate General. A report in Israel s Haaretz newspaper said there were 170 indictments in 2016.   A senior officer in the Israeli military said arrests for incitement require judicial approval, as they do inside Israel.  Many lone assailants post farewell messages before setting off. To  intercept  them, and prevent attacks, Israeli security forces comb through social networks using big data analytics   sophisticated software that analyses vast volumes of data.   Algorithms are used so that certain words, such as  martyr , raise a red flag, as do names of anyone who has launched an attack, a security source said.     Shin Bet intelligence agency chief Nadav Argaman says 2,000 potential  lone wolves  have been stopped by using advanced technology since 2016. A Shin Bet source said some potential attackers were arrested and prosecuted, and others just warned. Some suspects, the source said, were placed in administrative detention, under which Israel holds Palestinians without trial. Israel says that is necessary to prevent violence in cases where there is insufficient evidence to prosecute. Asked about Israel s policy, Facebook said public posts can be read by anyone, including law enforcement and intelligence agency officers. Google, which owns YouTube, declined comment. Others accused of online incitement include 16-year-old Tamara Abu-Laban was detained in East Jerusalem in July. Her father Moammar said she had shared a video online showing an elderly man arguing with Israeli security forces and, in a reference to the mosque that is Islam s third holiest shrine, saying:  Kill me, I want to die for al-Aqsa . She has not been charged but was held for two days and barred from using Facebook for 180 days. Her father said the Shin Bet called him in to say they were keeping an eye on her.  They are convinced she is going to do something. They told me to be careful. I tried to tell them it s just Facebook - she s just looking for  Likes ,  he said. Police did not comment on her case because she is a minor.  ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Venezuelan opposition disarray heaps pain on protesters,"CARACAS/SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - With some nursing wounds, others jailed and many heading abroad, Venezuela s young opposition supporters are demoralized by the ruling socialists  shock election win this month, after prolonged protests failed to oust President Nicolas Maduro. Having for months led rallies and battles against Maduro s security forces in which scores died, youth demonstrators reluctantly abandoned the streets as the opposition turned its attention to the Oct. 15 gubernatorial vote. Though the opposition looked set to win comfortably due to public anger over food and medicine shortages, plus soaring inflation, the government took 18 of 23 governorships.     That left thousands of young protesters furious and disillusioned with opposition leadership. Many had vigorously opposed participating in the election because it would legitimize what they see as a dictatorship.   We have been betrayed,  said graphic designer Manuel Melo, 21, who lost a kidney when hit by a water cannon jet.  The political opposition does not represent us,  he added, in his small bedroom in a poor neighborhood of the teeming capital Caracas. A stylized picture of a heart emblazoned one wall of the room, while a gas mask, used to protect him from tear gas during the unrest, adorned the other. Melo and many others now see the protests, which left 125 people dead and thousands wounded or in jail, as a waste of time.  They have little stomach to return to the fight and view the leaders of the opposition Democratic Unity (MUD) coalition as traitors for abandoning the streets in favor of a ballot they believe was rigged by the pro-Maduro election board. Their disillusionment heightened this week when four of the five winning opposition governors with the Democratic Action party broke ranks with the coalition to swear themselves in before an all-powerful legislative superbody that Maduro s foes had vowed never to recognize. That set off a round of unseemly in-fighting and recriminations within the opposition, with heavyweight leader Henrique Capriles saying he would abandon the coalition while Democratic Action leader Henry Ramos remained a member.  I m totally dejected because after all these protests, the election, nothing has changed,  said student Javier Lara, 18, who watched a fellow protester die in unrest in the volatile city of San Cristobal on the border with Colombia. Like many young Venezuelans, Lara now plans to head abroad as soon as possible - to Peru in his case.  We ve been sold out by the opposition,  he said.   The Democratic Unity coalition finds itself in crisis.  Its strategy of contesting the gubernatorial elections backfired spectacularly. In the wake of defeat, stunned opposition leaders could not even agree whether to pursue fraud allegations, with some refusing to accept the election results and others publicly admitting defeat.  A breakup, or reformulation of the coalition, now looks inevitable, with a new strategy and possibly fresh blood needed for the 2018 presidential election.  Though polls routinely showed the opposition had majority support, many Venezuelans view their leaders as an elitist group out-of-touch with their problems.  The MUD is all over the place,  said Antonio Ledezma, a veteran politician and former opposition mayor who is under house arrest.  The international community deserves an explanation of our behavior.  Some young opposition supporters are seeking inspiration away from traditional leaders. They voice admiration for Lorenzo Mendoza, a billionaire businessman who has shied away from politics, and Juan Carlos Caguaripano, a former National Guard captain who led an August attack on a military base. Heaping humiliation on the opposition, Maduro says daily in speeches that  peace  has won and a U.S.-backed plot to oust him has been defeated.  To stoke his foes  disarray, Maduro has urged Democratic Action leader Ramos - a hate figure for some younger opposition supporters - to stand in the next presidential vote.   Get ready for 2018, I m waiting for you!  Maduro said this week, exulting in the opposition s  chaos ,  back-stabbing  and  divisionism . ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1

Israel approves 176 new settler homes in East Jerusalem,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli authorities approved on Wednesday a major expansion of a Jewish settler enclave in the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem, issuing building permits  for 176 new housing units. The construction, which a Jerusalem municipal spokeswoman said was approved by the city s planning committee, was swiftly condemned by the Palestinians as a violation of international law. Construction of the new units will nearly triple the number of settler homes in the Nof Zion settlement, which currently has 91 dwellings and is surrounded by Palestinian houses in the Jabel al-Mukaber neighborhood. The area is located in territory that Israel captured and annexed in a 1967 Middle East war and which Palestinians seek as part of a state they want to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.  We are unifying Jerusalem through actions on the ground,  Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said in a statement about the settlement s expansion. Israel s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital has not won international recognition, and many countries regard the settlements it has built on occupied land as illegal and obstacles to any future land-for peace deal. Israel disputes this. Wasel Abu Yousif, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, called the construction plans in Jabel al-Mukaber  a challenge to all the calls by the international community  to halt settlement building. Last week, Israel announced approval for the construction of several hundred additional homes for settlers in the West Bank, drawing condemnation from Palestinians and the European Union. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have not been held since 2014, with settlement building one of the issues that led to their collapse. Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that are home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians.

German coalition talks deal early blow to Macron on Europe,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German parties exploring a coalition government have dealt an early blow to French President Emmanuel Macron s hopes for more expansive fiscal policies from Berlin, backing a balanced budget and rejecting the idea of a separate pot of cash for the euro zone. The Greens, seen as closest to Macron on economic policy and Europe, appeared to have caved in to demands by Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the Free Democrats (FDP) that a new government continue down a path of fiscal discipline. Merkel, whose conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month, is trying to forge a coalition with the pro-business FDP and the Greens, which requires bridging disagreements on taxes, immigration and foreign policy. In a joint paper agreed after late-night talks on Tuesday, the parties said they all supported a balanced budget. A senior Greens politician who participated in the talks also told Reuters that the parties were united in opposing Macron s idea for a euro zone budget.  None of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,  said Reinhard Buetikofer, a member of the European Parliament. The parties are expected to reconvene on Thursday to finalize a joint paper on Europe, after agreeing a rough blueprint for fiscal policy late on Tuesday. That blueprint included a pledge to respect  debt brake  legislation enshrined in the constitution since 2009, which forces the federal government to virtually eliminate structural budget deficits, limiting them to 0.35 percent of GDP. It also contained a commitment to provide relief to lower and middle income earners, dismantle the  solidarity tax  for poor eastern states and provide financial incentives to make German homes more energy efficient. Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens who is seen as a possible foreign minister in the new government, highlighted a decision to re-examine plans to raise defence spending by the outgoing  grand coalition  of Merkel s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD), who are moving into opposition. Tax relief and investment needs would be finalised once more details on tax revenues become available next month, Ozdemir said, suggesting that the balanced budget commitment was not final. The Greens politician also said that a new coalition would have to provide a  pro-European  answer to proposals from Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for closer cooperation in fiscal matters, defence and migration.  There are a lot of differences to overcome. But I am hoping for a clear commitment to Europe,  said Ozdemir in a video posted on the Greens website. Buetikofer said the Greens supported the idea of boosting investment within the framework of the existing EU budget. But their rejection of Macron s idea for a separate budget for the euro zone at such an early stage of the coalition talks was seen by some members of the party as an unnecessary  cave in  to Merkel s conservatives and the FDP. Macron has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks. One FDP participant who requested anonymity suggested that the Greens may have given away too much in the talks on Tuesday night and expressed concern that the leadership of the party could be forced to change tack in the days ahead by angry grass roots members. Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who ruled with the Greens for seven years, accused the environmentalist party of  preparing Frau Merkel s bed  in a desperate attempt to re-enter government. Immigration could also be a contentious issue in the coalition talks as Merkel s conservatives row back on the open-door policy towards refugees that she adopted in 2015. This will also be on the agenda on Thursday. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Workers rights get Qatar nod as ILO poised decide on abuse probe,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar has signed 36 worker protection agreements with countries that provide much of its labour force, state media reported on Wednesday, weeks before the International Labour Organisation is to decide whether to investigate it for worker abuse.   Qatar is keen to show it is tackling allegations of worker exploitation as it prepares to host the 2022 soccer World Cup, which the Gulf Arab state has presented as a showcase of its progress and development. State news agency QNA did not provide details of the bilateral agreements, but said they are in addition to five memorandums of understanding, preparations for a minimum wage, and an employment support fund that would help workers faced with overdue wages. Labour and rights groups have attacked the gas-rich state for its  kafala  sponsorship system, which forces the country s 1.6 million mainly Asian foreign workers to seek their employer s consent to change jobs or leave the country - a measure groups say leaves workers open to exploitation. Qatar last year issued changes to this system, allowing workers who have completed contracts to change jobs freely and imposing fines on businesses who confiscate employees  passports, but rights groups have said the new measures do not go far enough. Qatar is expected to present a report by November on implementation of its reforms to the ILO, which will then decide whether to form a commission of inquiry, a rare sanction which the United Nations agency has imposed only about a dozen times since World War Two.

China's Xi taps low-profile official to take over war on  graft,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday tapped a low-profile official to lead his signature war on corruption, replacing the retiring Wang Qishan, whose sweeping anti-graft campaign had made him China s second most-powerful politician. Zhao Leji was appointed to the new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee and will take up Wang s role as head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) from his position as head of the Communist Party s powerful Organisation Department, which is in charge of personnel. Zhao s appointment is likely to spur efforts to turn the fight against graft from a campaign into a structured feature of China s political system, analysts said. Xi s corruption fight has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials, and he said during the twice-a-decade party congress that wrapped up this week that the battle to take down both  tigers  and  flies  will continue, a reference to elite officials and ordinary bureaucrats.  Zhao s job appears to be less about taking down tigers and swatting flies but more about effectively institutionalizing the anti-corruption system and getting the CCDI mechanisms implemented at all levels,  said Damien Ma, associate director at the Paulson Institute, a U.S. think tank.  It s going to be challenging, but he does have everyone s files as former head of the Organisation Department.  Speaking to reporters after unveiling his seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, Xi said that the party s battle to rid itself of corruption, written into its constitution on Tuesday, is a  journey without an end .  There cannot be any virus in the party structure,  he said. Wang, sometimes called the Communist Party s  fireman  for his skill in resolving crises, has widely been credited with the success and vigor of the graft fight, which has been highly popular with the public while rattling the party elite. Wang, who was previously vice governor of the central bank and helped oversee China s recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis, built the once toothless and obscure CCDI into a feared watchdog that felled party heavyweights, including the former domestic security chief, Zhou Yongkang. The campaign has also taken down many of Xi s rivals and helped to tighten his grip on power. Zhao, at 60 the youngest member of the Standing Committee, has been steadily promoted through his career, which has included long stints in poor rural areas, giving him a comparatively low profile among Chinese leaders. Xi and Zhao have a  Shaanxi connection , according to Cheng Li, a U.S.-based expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution. They are among a group of politicians with personal and political ties to northwest China s Shaanxi province, Xi s ancestral home, who have moved up the party ranks in recent years. Zhao spent much of his early career in the Shaanxi countryside, leaving him with a strong regional accent. INSTITUTIONALIZING ANTI-CORRUPTION Xi plans to overhaul China s anti-corruption architecture to create a powerful super-ministry, the National Supervision Commission, that will combine work by a number agencies, not including the CCDI, although the two will share offices and personnel. The commission will also have the power to investigate civil servants, even if they are not party members, and will be backed by law, giving legal authority to many of the measures currently used by the party to investigate officials. Xi also said last week that a secret party interrogation system, known as  shuanggui , would be replaced with new detention measures, although rights groups say that it is unclear whether suspects will have access to lawyers under the new system. Some experts have questioned how much power the new body will have without Wang at the helm. It is not clear who will head the new commission or exactly what its relationship will be with the CCDI.

Cambodian opposition member pardoned at PM's request,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A senator from Cambodia s main opposition party was pardoned on Wednesday from the seven-year jail sentence he had been given over a Facebook posting, in a conciliatory sign from Prime Minister Hun Sen towards his opponents. A crackdown on the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) has led to the arrest of party leader Kem Sokha on treason charges and a government push to have it dissolved completely. That has brought protests from Western donors. Senator Hong Sok Hour, 59, was sentenced last year over a fake official document he had posted on Facebook saying that Cambodia and Vietnam had decided to dissolve their border. It is a sensitive subject in Cambodia, where Hun Sen s opponents have long accused him of being a Vietnamese puppet since he was put in his post in 1985 when Vietnam occupied Cambodia after ousting the genocidal Khmer Rouge. Hong Sok Hour was pardoned by King Norodom Sihamoni at Hun Sen s request.  He wrote a letter of apology to Samdech Decho and asked him to write to the king to issue a pardon,  Phay Siphan told Reuters, using Hun Sen s official title.  He admitted his fault.  Hun Sen s critics accuse him of trying to turn the country into a one-party state for the ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP) and to ensure that he wins a general election next year without any effective challenge. The opposition welcomed the pardon.  This is a positive sign and each time there s a royal pardon, the political situation calms down,  said Mu Sochua, a deputy to Kem Sokha who fled into exile fearing that she was about to be arrested, too. However, Hun Sen reiterated on Wednesday that the CNRP would be dissolved and any elected officials who defected from the opposition to his party would be allowed to keep their positions.

"New Zealand protectionist Winston Peters appointed deputy PM, foreign minister","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Veteran protectionist politician Winston Peters was appointed New Zealand s new deputy prime minister and foreign minister on Wednesday, saying he would seek a greater voice in international affairs, including North Korea. Peters visited North Korea when he was foreign minister in a previous New Zealand government in 2005. New Zealand First party leader Peters delivered government to the Labour party through a coalition deal after a closely fought election on Sept. 23 failed to result in a majority for the governing National or Labour parties. Peters and Labour Prime Minister-designate Jacinda Ardern have found common ground in  fortress New Zealand -type  policies. Both are looking to curb immigration, renegotiate certain trade deals and adjust the role of the central bank. Ardern also wants to ban overseas buyers from purchasing existing homes as prices grow more unaffordable for local residents. A bill to ban such purchases will be introduced by Christmas, Ardern told a workers  conference on Wednesday. But trade and foreign ownership restrictions could hurt New Zealand s reputation as an open economy and antagonize the likes of China. Trade between the two countries has grown to more than NZ$20 billion ($14.4 billion) a year, and Chinese President Xi Jinping called the relationship  unprecedented  in its depth. While Peters was expected to be offered the deputy role after obtaining the balance of power, his appointment as both deputy prime minister and foreign minister was unexpected. Richard Shaw, politics professor at Massey University, said Peters was a  conservative economic nationalist .   One of the things we ve seen from him over the last couple of weeks is the concern with the extent that relatively unbridled free trade has on his constituents,  said Shaw. Many of Labour and New Zealand First s policies during the campaign drew on voters  concerns that immigration and foreign buyers of local homes were putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices. Peters said he wanted to forge stronger ties with Australia, after tensions have increased recently. Labour s finance spokesman Grant Robertson will become finance minister in the incoming government, placing him at the center of plans to overhaul monetary policy.  Robertson, a political adviser under former Labour Prime Minister Helen Clark, will appoint a new central bank governor. The Labour-led government plans to reform the Reserve Bank Act to possibly include employment, alongside inflation, as a dual target.

Factbox: Xi allies dominate China's new 25-member Politburo,"(Reuters) - While the new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee unveiled on Wednesday by China s ruling Communist Party was not packed with people regarded as close to President Xi Jinping, his allies dominate the new Politburo - the second tier in Beijing s power structure. Of the 25 members of the Politburo, at least 14 were known to be close to Xi, according to sources with ties to the leadership and foreign diplomats in Beijing. In five years time, some of them could be promoted to the Standing Committee, China s pinnacle of power.  The 14 exclude Xi himself, who heads the Politburo. By comparison, the new Standing Committee included just one close Xi ally, although the other members are not seen as rivals.    Xi s known allies on the Politburo, in alphabetical order: Cai Qi, Beijing party boss Chen Miner, Chongqing party boss Chen Xi, who is likely to become minister of the party s organization or personnel department Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to become Xi s chief of staff as director of the party s General Office Huang Kunming, expected to become the party s propaganda minister Li Hongzhong, Tianjin party boss Li Qiang, Jiangsu party boss Li Xi, Liaoning party boss Li Zhanshu, who is tipped to become head of parliament having been appointed the third ranked member of the Standing Committee Liu He, economic adviser Wang Chen, a vice chairman and concurrently secretary-general of parliament General Xu Qiliang, a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission Yang Xiaodu, minister of supervision and deputy secretary of the anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Zhang Youxia, a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission The average age of the new Politburo is 62.48 compared with 61.16 five years ago The oldest member is General Xu Qiliang, a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. Xu and five others are at the cusp of retirement at 67 and can only serve one five-year term. The youngest is Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua, who was born in 1963. Two others were born in the 1960s, Chen Miner and Ding Xuexiang, 1960 and 1962 respectively. A fourth, Li Qiang, was born in 1959. Sun Chunlan, minister of the party s United Front Work Department, is the lone woman in the new Politburo. The previous Politburo had two women. Top diplomat Yang Jiechi surprisingly made it to the Politburo and could become one of four vice premiers, the first diplomat to hold that post since Qian Qichen, who was vice premier from 1993 to 2003. Qian was instrumental in breaking China out of diplomatic isolation after the military crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy protests. General Zhang Youxia, a close Xi ally, is a Politburo newcomer. He is one of two vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, and his promotion confirms a Reuters report on Oct. 17.  Vice President Li Yuanchao, outgoing Propaganda Minister Liu Qibao and former Xinjiang party boss Zhang Chunxian have not reached retirement age but did not retain their Politburo seats. Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong is not on the new Politburo, most likely dashing his chances of becoming party boss of China s financial capital.  China s top cop, Politburo member Guo Shengkun, is expected to become security chief. There are no ethnic minorities on the new Politburo. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1

Thailand kicks off sumptuous funeral of King Bhumibol Adulyadej,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand on Wednesday marked the start of a lavish, five-day funeral for King Bhumibol Adulyadej with a Buddhist religious ceremony attended by senior members of its royal family. King Bhumibol, who died last year aged 88, will be cremated on Thursday on a royal pyre within a cremation complex of gold pavilions in front of Bangkok s Grand Palace, in a ceremony that is expected to draw about 250,000 mourners. Thailand has observed a year of mourning for King Bhumibol, who was regarded as a pillar of stability during a reign of seven decades that witnessed political upheaval and rapid development in the Southeast Asian nation.   It s overwhelming,  said one mourner, Aporn Wongdee, 60,  who hails from the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat.  I ve been here for two days already and I want to see our father to heaven.       A sum of $90 million has been set aside for the funeral, the likes of which has never been seen in Thailand, officials involved in the funeral preparations said. King Maha Vajiralongkorn, known as Rama X, who inherited the throne in December on his father s death, arrived at the Grand Palace by car on Wednesday as soldiers dressed in red uniforms and black hats stood to attention.  He was flanked by his two daughters. Live television images from inside the palace showed the king lighting candles in front of his father s coffin and a symbolic royal urn. The Buddhist funeral ceremony, mixed with Hindu rituals, was attended by 119 Buddhist monks who chanted prayers in the ancient Pali language. Queues of black-clad mourners, many carrying portraits of the king, snaked around parts of Bangkok s old town, waiting to enter the cremation area. By mid-afternoon, 25,000 mourners had gathered around the cremation site, city police said. In what is expected to be an emotionally-charged morning, King Bhumibol s body will be moved on Thursday from the Grand Palace to a crematorium in a public square in front, where thousands of people have already pitched tents to ensure places. On Thursday, three processions will make their way from the palace to the cremation site - a series of specially-erected Thai pavilions that took nearly a year to build. Some Thais have folded flowers of sandalwood paper to be used in the cremation, in the belief that their fragrance guides the soul of the departed to heaven. The cremation day has been declared a national holiday, when banks will be closed and major shopping centers will be shut from 3 p.m. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Factbox: Funeral of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Crowds began gathering in Bangkok on Wednesday for the official beginning of the funeral of Thailand s revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The lavish five-day event, which runs until Sunday, opened with rows of Buddhist monks in orange robes chanting prayers. A funeral procession and cremation ceremony are scheduled for Thursday. About 250,000 Thais are expected to attend the cremation ceremony, which will be led by the new King Maha Vajiralongkorn. King Bhumibol, 88, who ruled for more than seven decades, was widely regarded as the nation s moral compass during periods of intermittent political unrest. Since his death on Oct. 13 last year, the country has observed a year of official mourning, with many Thais wearing black. Here are details of the cremation: * The king s cremation will take place on Thursday, which has been declared a public holiday, when many businesses have announced they will be shut all day or close at midday. * A budget of 3 billion baht ($90 million) has been set aside for the funeral, which will be attended by dozens of heads of state, including King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck of Bhutan and Japan s Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko. * Many hotels near the cremation area have been booked out by mourners.     * The site of the royal cremation includes nine spire-roofed  Thai pavilions to honor the late king, who was also known as Rama IX. * The site took nearly a year to complete and was built from scratch. It features sculptures of mythical creatures and auspicious animals such as lions and elephants. * The cremation will make use of sandalwood flowers whose fragrance ancient Thais believed would lead the soul of the dead to heaven. * Those unable to attend the funeral will be able to visit 85 miniature replicas of the site across Thailand. * New King Maha Vajiralongkorn formally ascended the throne last year but his coronation will take place after his father s funeral.

EU lawmakers urge Malta money laundering inquiry after journalist's murder,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union should investigate Malta s anti-money laundering system, EU lawmakers said on Tuesday in response to the murder of a Maltese journalist who reported widely on financial and political corruption. Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was blown up by a car bomb last week, had published leaked documents on alleged money laundering cases involving top Maltese officials. EU parliamentarians said Malta now needed to show it was clean.  The Maltese government has failed to take serious action against high level cases of money laundering in its country , Green Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) Eva Joly and Sven Giegold said in a joint statement.  We want a serious investigation by the European Commission on Malta s respect of the European rules against money laundering.   EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in a letter to Green MEPs dated Oct. 23 that  based on the information available so far, there appear to be no grounds to suspect a systematic breach of Union law pertaining to the prevention of money laundering  in Malta. But she added that the Commission had requested more information from Malta on cases of alleged money laundering involving Keith Allen Schembri, the chief of staff of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. Schembri has denied the allegations. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told Reuters in an interview last week that the island s  financial services sector is as transparent, solid and compliant as any other European jurisdiction.  Ahead of a debate on the  protection of journalists and the defense of media freedom in Malta , the European Parliament held a minute s silence, at a session in Strasbourg attended by Caruana Galizia s widower and children.  Parliament President Antonio Tajani said the parliament s press room would be named after the murdered reporter. He added that Europol, the EU law enforcement agency, should help investigate Caruana Galizia s murder  as part of an international investigation where all police forces can contribute to find the culprits . The Maltese government has sought assistance from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and from Dutch experts to help resolve the case.  The head of the Italian parliament s anti-mafia committee urged Malta to toughen laws to combat organized crime. Italian investigators have traced criminal proceeds to companies set up in Malta to launder money by the southern Italian mafia groups. Anti-mafia committee head Rosy Bindi said during a visit to the island that Malta had to close legal loopholes.  Those who order assassinations are often the ones who fear that loopholes will be closed,  she said. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
U.S. says 'administrative error' blocked Indonesia military chief's travel,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia s military chief was temporarily barred from traveling to the United States at the weekend due to an  administrative error , the U.S. embassy in Jakarta said in an online statement on Wednesday. General Gatot Nurmantyo was about to board a flight to the United States on Saturday when he was told that the Customs and Border Protection Agency had denied him entry, even though he had a visa and an official invitation from the chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff to attend a conference in Washington.  General Gatot Nurmantyo and his wife were delayed in their ability to board their flight due to an administrative error.  The error was quickly corrected. We have taken appropriate measures to prevent this matter from occurring again,  the U.S. embassy said in a statement, without elaborating. The incident prompted top U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and envoys in Jakarta to apologize to Indonesia as it demanded details as to why Nurmantyo was blocked, where he had been able to travel to the United States on official trips before. U.S. Homeland Security Department said earlier this week that the U.S. embassy in Jakarta had informed Nurmantyo s office that he might be delayed in boarding his flight because of unspecified  U.S. security protocols . It added that the U.S. government was unable to resolve the problem before Nurmantyo arrived at the airport and he was denied boarding. The general was eventually cleared and booked on another flight but he chose not to travel. Nurmantyo told reporters on Tuesday that he did not travel on a later flight because he had informed President Joko Widodo of the issue and that he would only travel  on further orders from the president .   There s no signal (from the president) so I no longer have the initiative to go,  Nurmantyo said, adding he was disappointed at not being able to meet his friend and counterpart General Joseph F. Dunford, who had invited him to attend an anti-terrorism conference. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
China speculators target 'Huning' elevator firm on political namesake's promotion,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A little-known Chinese elevator maker saw its Shenzhen-listed shares surge the maximum 10 percent on Wednesday. The reason? The company s name resembles that of Wang Huning, a Chinese Communist Party theoretician who was elevated on Wednesday to China s apex of power.  The frenzied buying in Hangzhou Huning Elevator Parts Co, whose business has nothing to do with Wang, offers the latest example of the enduring influence of short-term speculators, despite regulators  stepped-up campaign against  pump and dump  trading. The government is introducing more foreign institutional investors, hoping they can help improve the trading culture in the country s stock market - sometimes likened to a casino. U.S. index publisher MSCI will include China A-shares in its global indexes next year. But Wednesday s surge in Huning Elevator shows that many investors still pick stocks merely by name, not fundamentals.  This is pure speculation, spurred by irrational euphoria. It has nothing to do with fundamentals,  said Yang Hai, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities.  Heady investors who chased the stock will be burnt.       Trading in Huning Elevator was calm in the morning, but that changed after the Communist Party revealed around midday its new Politburo Standing Committee, the country s top policy-making body. The seven-man unit included Wang, a one-time law professor from Shanghai who has risen steadily up the party s ranks but mostly operated behind the scenes. When the stock resumed trading in the afternoon, a buying spree pushed it up the maximum 10 percent. It gave up some gains in afternoon trading and closed up 6 percent. The elevator maker, which cannot be immediately reached for comment, forecast roughly flat nine-month profit on Oct. 13. Name-based stock-picking is not uncommon in China, especially during major political events. Last November, when news headlines pointed to a likely presidential election win for Donald Trump, shares in Wisesoft Co Ltd - whose Chinese name sounds like  Trump s big win  - surged, while Yunan Xiyi Industrial- whose Chinese name bears resemblance to  Aunt Hillary  - slumped. And when Barack Obama won the U.S. presidential election in 2008, speculators piled into home appliances maker Aucma Co Ltd, which sounds roughly like the Chinese pronunciation of Obama. Some listed firms in China even took advantage of speculators  preference for sexy names. In 2015, property developer Shanghai Duolun Industry changed its name to P2P Financial Information Services Co, in an apparent attempt to tap into investors  mania toward fin tech at the time, triggering a surge in its shares, before the bubble burst.

Vietnam jails student activist six years for propaganda against the state,"(Reuters) - A Vietnamese student activist was jailed for six years plus four years of probation by a local court on Wednesday for conducting propaganda against the state, his lawyer said. Despite sweeping reforms to its economy and growing openness to social change, including gay, lesbian and transgender rights, Vietnam s sole Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism. Phan Kim Khanh, 24, is a student studying international relations and the eldest child of a Catholic farming family in a remote area north of capital Hanoi. He had written blogs criticizing the government before he was arrested earlier this year.  The proof used in court against Khanh was vague,  lawyer Ha Huy Son told Reuters, adding he was not certain if Khanh wants to appeal. Human Rights Watch on Tuesday called on Vietnam to drop all charges and release Khanh.  The bogus crime of conducting propaganda against the state is designed to silence peaceful critics of the Vietnamese authorities,  said Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch s Asia director.   Vietnam ought to get rid of these laws and stop persecuting students and ordinary people for just talking about the country s problems on the internet.  ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"Under Trump plan, refugees from 11 countries face additional U.S. barriers","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration will temporarily delay processing of most refugees from 11 countries identified as high-risk, while resuming refugee admissions for other countries, government officials said on Tuesday. Most of the affected countries are in the Middle East and Africa, according to documents seen by Reuters. The administration also will place on hold a program that allows for family reunification for some refugees resettled in the United States, according to a Trump administration memo seen by Reuters and sent to Congress on Tuesday. The resettling of so-called following-to-join refugees will resume, according to the memo, once screening  enhancements have been implemented.  U.S. officials said the changes were aimed at protecting U.S. national security, but refugee advocates said they amounted to a de facto ban on refugees from the 11 countries and were unnecessary, since refugees are already heavily vetted. The changes come at the close of a 120-day ban on most refugees ordered by President Donald Trump to allow a review of vetting processes. The 120 days ended on Tuesday, and Trump issued an executive order allowing the general resumption of the U.S. refugee program. The memo expressed concerns about admitting refugees from the 11 countries and said the government will conduct a 90-day review  to determine what additional safeguards, if any, are necessary to ensure ... the security and welfare of the United States.  Trump took office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions, in line with promises he made during the 2016 election campaign. He quickly issued temporary bans on refugees and travelers from several Muslim-majority countries, which were challenged in court. Opponents of the bans argued that the policies were aimed at barring Muslims from the United States. The administration has denied any intent to discriminate and says its travel ban and security changes are meant to protect the United States from terrorist acts. The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the last remaining challenge to an earlier version of Trump s travel ban. The 11 countries to face further hurdles are those whose refugees are currently required to undergo higher-level security screening known as Security Advisory Opinions, or SAOs.  As of the end of 2016, SAOs were required for most adult male refugees who were nationals of Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, as well as Palestinians who lived in those countries, according to a State Department document seen by Reuters. Three sources familiar with refugee processing said that list was still current. Officials declined to name the 11 countries. A senior U.S. official told reporters on condition of anonymity that during the 90-day review period, refugees from the 11 countries can still be admitted to the United States on a case-by-case basis,  if it s deemed to be in the national interest and they pose no threat.    But the administration s memo, signed by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, said the government will reallocate resources used to process refugees from SAO countries to those from other locations where  the processing may not be as resource intensive.  Refugees International, an advocacy group, said the decision amounted to  a new and near-total ban on admission of refugees from 11 nationality groups.  Citizens of the 11 countries comprised 44 percent of the nearly 54,000 refugees admitted into the United States in the 2017 fiscal year, according to State Department data. Of the countries, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Iran sent by far the most refugees to the United States. All but two of the countries, North Korea and South Sudan, are majority Muslim, though many of the refugees that come from those countries are religious minorities in their own states.  Of nearly 2,600 Iranian refugees resettled in the United States last year, for instance, a majority were Christian, according to State Department data.  The  follow-to-join  refugee program being put on hold allows refugees who have entered the United States to apply for close family members to join them. About 2,000 such refugee family members came to the United States in 2015, according to DHS data. In a separate State Department memo seen by Reuters and issued this week, the administration also laid out additional screening for all refugees seeking admission into the United States, including details of their whereabouts going back a decade, twice as long as before. Refugees will also have to provide more detailed information about their family members. The new requirements could put an additional burden on refugees fleeing war, famine or ethnic cleansing, whose lives have often been upended and whose family members may be scattered across the world, refugee advocates said.

"Ugandan MPs get $8,000 each for work on extending president's rule: spokesman","KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan legislators have each pocketed 29 million Ugandan shillings ($8,000) as a payout for consultations on legislation to extend the president s rule, a parliamentary spokesman said on Tuesday, a move opponents denounced as a bribe.  The bill would scrap a constitutional age cap preventing President Yoweri Museveni, 73 and in power for 31 years, from standing in the next election. It is likely to pass, given the ruling party s majority, when it is voted on later this year.  A staunch ally of Western powers, Museveni is widely seen as an anchor of stability in the often volatile Great Lakes region after decades of violent Ugandan dictators. Critics say he has evolved into just another African strongman using corrupt and ruthless tactics to retain power for life.    Parliamentary spokesman Chris Obore said the one-off payment had been released to the legislators  bank accounts this week.   It s to help them to consult with their constituents on this bill,  he told Reuters.  MPs are among Uganda s best-paid public servants; their monthly remuneration of about $5,900 already includes expenses for regular travel to their constituencies to consult with voters. But low-paid public employees like teachers, police and health workers often do not see their salaries paid on time - typical delays can run to three months. Public hospitals are often missing important drugs.   Public anger over waste and corruption is growing, and protests have erupted in different parts of Uganda gainst the bill. Security forces have responded by using tear gas and live bullets to suppress the demonstrations.  Dozens of people have been arrested and two have died in the protests.  At the moment, Museveni cannot run for re-election in 2021 because the existing constitution bars candidates aged above 75 years of age. He backs the private member s bill, introduced in parliament last month, that seeks to scrap the age cap. The amendment, which critics say will clear the way for Museveni to rule for the rest of his life, has met broad resistance from some ruling party supporters, opposition, religious leaders and rights activists.   This is an outright bribe,  John Baptist Nambeshe, one of the MPs opposed to the bill, told Reuters.  To claim that it s a normal parliamentary facilitation - it defeats logic.  In total, the East African country is spending about 13 billion shillings ($3.55 million) to facilitate consultations on the bill by 445 legislators, Obore said.  In 2005, MPs were also offered a one-off payment of five million shillings to consult on a draft bill that removed a two-term cap on incumbency from the constitution, allowing Museveni to stand again. Each term is five years.  That was the only other occasion MPs have been paid to consult on a specific bill, and it also attracted wide criticism as a thinly-disguised bribe. The bill was passed.

"Plague kills 124 in Madagascar, cities most affected: report","KIGALI (Reuters) - A plague epidemic in Madagascar has killed 124 people since August in an outbreak that has hit the island s two main cities the hardest, the authorities said on Wednesday.     Plague is endemic in Madagascar, but the outbreak that has caused 1,192 suspected cases since August is especially worrying because it started earlier in the season than usual and has hit urban rather than rural areas.

Families returning to ruined Philippine city taught to identify bombs,"MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Philippine teachers on Tuesday gave families returning to the  destroyed lakeside city of Marawi a course on how to identify unexploded bombs in their homes and warned them to stay clear. The five-month battle to retake Marawi from pro-Islamic State rebels left the city in ruins. The government announced the end of military operations on Monday in the country s biggest security crisis in years, allowing rebuilding and rehabilitation efforts to begin.. The teachers taught children and their parents how to recognize live mortar shells, grenades, aircraft rockets and  improvised explosive devices  in their villages. Security forces used artillery bombardment and air strikes to flush out the gunmen who endured 154 days of the offensive by stockpiling huge amounts of weapons, including bombs.  Warnings from the teachers included drawings of inquisitive children hammering bombs and trying to set them on fire.  This helps us parents to understand and tell our children not to touch or get near the bombs,  said Sobaida Sidic, a housewife attending the training.  Authorities said 920 militants, 165 troops and police and at least 45 civilians were killed in the conflict, which displaced more than 300,000 people. Lominog Manoga, a principal at a school in Marawi overseeing the training, said it was important to teach people the risks. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte had declared Marawi City liberated last week, even though fighting was not actually over. On Sunday, he said it was important to be vigilant because no country could escape Islamic State s  clutches of evil . ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

French government spokesman gets Macron's backing to lead party,"PARIS (Reuters) - French government spokesman Christophe Castaner said on Wednesday that Emmanuel Macron was backing him to lead the year-old Republic on the Move (LREM) party that brought the president to victory earlier this year. If Castaner wins a Nov. 18 election for the party s leadership, it could trigger a minor government reshuffle as he is a cabinet member in charge of relations with parliament. LREM won a large majority in parliamentary elections in June, consolidating Macron s presidential win in May. Like Macron, most LREM lawmakers had never previously held elected office.  If he chose me and supported my candidacy in the collective talks we re having, it s because I ve got the support of the party s rank and file,  Castaner said on RTL radio. Previously a Socialist lawmaker from southwestern France, Castaner joined Macron s campaign early as his spokesman. Since Macron s victory, Castaner has become a familiar face on national television defending the president s reform agenda. Thanks to Castaner s Socialist roots, Macron s backing for him could help counter recent criticism of Macron as a president of the rich for partially scrapping the wealth tax, a symbol of France s income redistribution system cherished on the Left. Castaner said that for the moment no one else had put forward their candidacy to lead the party. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Australia campuses warned of 'clandestine' influence in apparent poke at China,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s domestic spy chief has warned that universities need to be  very conscious  of foreign interference in an apparent reference to China s perceived undercover influence on campuses. Australian Security Intelligence Organisation director-general Duncan Lewis told politicians in Canberra late on Tuesday that espionage and foreign interference were an  insidious threat . Lewis said foreign powers were  clandestinely seeking to shape  the opinion of the Australian public, media organizations and government officials  in order to advance their countries  own political objectives .  Lewis did not specifically name China in his late night testimony to a parliamentary inquiry, but when questioned about China s involvement, he said he  strongly identified  with comments made by a senior government official this month that universities should protect themselves from Chinese influence. Asked last week about the Communist Party s overseas activities in places like Australia, a senior official said Chinese people living overseas had to respect the laws of the countries in which they lived. China is Australia s largest trading partner, with business spurred by a wide-ranging China-Australia Free Trade Agreement signed in 2015.  Relations between Australia and China have been tested in recent months after the United States, Japan and Australia voiced concerns over Beijing s unilateral actions in the disputed South China Sea, including continued artificial land building.

Park is standing trial accused of bribery, abuse of power and coercion, having been forced to step down in March after parliament voted to impeach her at the end of 2016. She has been held in detention since late March, although under South Korean law a defendant in a criminal trial at a lower court can be detained for a maximum of six months. Citing concerns that Park could destroy evidence if she was released, the Seoul Central District Court issued an additional arrest warrant on Oct. 13 in order to extend her detention by six months. The court s move prompted her entire defense team to quit in protest at a session on Oct. 16. Having lost her legal team, Park gave health reasons for her failure to attend a session three days later.   After witnessing the collapse of the presumption of innocence and the principle of investigation without detention, we concluded that our efforts to defend Park will be meaningless,  Park s former lawyer, Yoo Yeong-ha, told the court last week.   The court s decision to issue an additional arrest warrant will remain as one of humiliating moments in South Korea s judiciary history,  Yoo said. A Seoul Central District Court spokesman said five state attorneys had been appointed to take over Park s defense. Citing court sources, Yonhap news agency reported the new defense team would have to review about 120,000 pages of court documents to prepare for upcoming hearings. Park s supporters have asked a United Nations body to investigate whether Park was being prevented from getting proper medical treatment and possible violation of her human rights due to her detention.

Iraq readies for final offensive on Islamic State near Syrian border,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces are about to launch an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, the military said on Wednesday.  Your security forces are now coming to liberate you,  said leaflets dropped by the Iraqi air force on the western border region of al-Qaim and Rawa, according to a statement from the Joint Operations Command in Baghdad.  The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi ite militias backed by Iran and Russia. Islamic State s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, in a grueling battle which lasted nine months.  The militants  Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces last week. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. He urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks.  God is with us in this last assault on Daesh members,  said the leaflets dropped by the Iraqi forces on the border area with Syria, referring to Islamic State.   Tell those among your children and relatives who took up a weapon against the state to throw it aside immediately, and to go to any house on top of which a white flag have been raised when the liberation forces enter al-Qaim.

Indonesia arrests nine with alleged Islamic State links,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities arrested nine men suspected of having links to a militant network loyal to Islamic State and planning a series of attacks on police posts, said a police spokesman. Counter-terrorism police have grappled with a recent resurgence in homegrown radicalism in the world s largest Muslim-majority country, inspired by extremist group Islamic State. Police said eight men were arrested on Tuesday in Riau province and one man in South Sulawesi province. They were alleged to have links to Indonesia s most high-profile militant network Jemaah Asharut Daulah (JAD) which is loyal to Islamic State.  They were planning attacks on police stations from the district level all the way to the provincial level,  national police spokesman Rikwanto said of the men arrested in Riau. He added that the men were suspected of joining a training camp in a neighboring province where they learned to shoot guns and assemble bombs. Detachment 88, the country s elite counter-terrorism police unit usually steps up surveillance and raids near the end of the year, foiling militant plots targeting New Year s Eve and Christmas celebrations and popular tourist spots. Authorities suspect there are hundreds of Islamic State sympathizers in Indonesia, some of whom have traveled to Syria to fight alongside the group. There are heightened concerns over the return of battle-hardened militants as Islamic State loses territory in the Middle East.    Four people were killed when Islamic State-linked militants launched a gun-and-bomb attack in the heart of the capital Jakarta in January, 2016. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
Tears in rain as Thais gather for late king's funeral,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Somber crowds began gathering to pay final respects to Thailand s late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, braving a tropical downpour to camp out along the funeral procession route for a monarch who died last year and was revered by some as a demi-god. The five-day Buddhist ceremony, which begins on Wednesday, has taken nearly a year to prepare and 3 billion baht ($90 million) has been set aside to pay for the funeral. Arriving a day early to guarantee their place for a funeral that is expected to draw 250,000 people, mourners pitched flimsy tents in the middle of Bangkok s old quarter to provide some protection from the torrential rain. Hotels in the old town neighborhood have been booked up weeks in advance, and a national holiday has been declared for Oct. 26, the day of the cremation. Although he was a constitutional monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been credited with reviving the prestige of the monarchy. Aged 88 when he died, the king was viewed by many people a pillar of stability in the politically turbulent Southeast Asian country, where a military junta currently holds power. The king s cremation site, which features gold-tipped pavilions built for the occasion, is a stone s throw from the Grand Palace, popular with foreign tourists. Even though the funeral had yet to begin, many of the people gathering had tears in their eyes and were visibly emotional.  Hunched beneath a makeshift tent made of cloth and string, Chalermporn Paebutr, a 72-year-old woman from northern Thailand, described her determination to bid farewell to a much-loved monarch.  I traveled here two days ago so that I could be the first to get a good spot,  she told Reuters.  We only have to brave the rain for a few days. This is worth it if we can be near him one last time.  Around 1,000 people had camped overnight in the downpour, police said on Tuesday. Some only had their plastic raincoats for protection. Thailand has suffered floods since Oct. 10. Nine people have died, and 19 of the country s 77 provinces have been hit affected.  The floods will not affect the cremation ceremony in any way,  interior minister Anupong Paochinda told reporters. New King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the late king s only son, will lead the cremation ceremony.  Thailand has a harsh law, known as Article 112, against insulting the monarchy, and prosecutions have skyrocketed since the junta came to power following a coup in 2014. The United Nations has voiced concern over the use of the law to clamp down on free speech and has repeatedly called on Thailand to amend it. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Pyongyang university needs non-U.S. teachers as travel ban leaves staff shortages,"SEOUL (Reuters) - The only western-funded university in North Korea is scrambling to recruit teachers not from the United States after a U.S. travel ban to the isolated country forced the school to start the September semester with only half of its faculty. According to a recruitment notice from a faculty member of Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) reviewed by Reuters, the school is on a  vigorous lecturer recruitment campaign  for the spring semester slated to start next year. The notice, which said the recruitment focus is  non-U.S. professors  mainly from Asia and Europe, suggests that discussions with the U.S. State Department about receiving special exemptions for PUST s volunteers have not gone well. Of the roughly 130 foreigners at PUST including faculty members, staffers and family members, about 60 had been U.S. citizens, according to people familiar with PUST operations.  Needless to say, our chronic faculty shortage and curriculum instability have been exacerbated even further, translating into the emergency situation of crippled school operation and curriculum running,  said the notice sent out by Paul Song, currently acting dean of the international finance and management department at PUST. As of Sept. 1, the U.S. State Department has enforced a ban on Americans traveling to North Korea following the death earlier this year of an American student who had been detained by the state while on a tour. It also advised U.S. citizens living there to leave. North Korea has criticized Washington s decision to ban U.S. passport holders from visiting the North, with state media describing it as a  sordid  attempt to limit human exchanges. It has also said its doors are always open for all Americans who wish to visit. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have escalated significantly in the wake of numerous missile tests and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test by Pyongyang last month. Insults and threats exchanged between the North s leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have also exacerbated global jitters over possible military conflict.  A month after the fall semester had started, a PUST official told Reuters high security concerns over North Korea has made it  difficult to find additional replacement staff .  A number of organizations are unwilling to approve staff to travel,  the official added. The school was founded in 2010 by a Korean American evangelical Christian with the goal of helping North Korea s future elite learn the skills to modernize the North and engage with the outside world. Since its founding, the school has grown to about 500 undergraduate and 60 graduate students studying in mostly three departments - electronic and computer engineering, international finance and management and agriculture and life sciences.

Philippine President Duterte to visit Japan ahead of key regional summits,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will visit Japan for talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this month, ahead of key regional meetings beginning with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering in Vietnam in November.  Japan and the Philippines have close ties and our strategic partnership can promote stability in the region,  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday during a regular press briefing.  Duterte will arrive on Oct 29 for a three day visit, Suga said. Japan is concerned about China s growing power in the South China Sea and sees cooperation with the Philippines, which lies on the waterway s eastern side, as key to helping prevent the spread of Beijing s influence into the western Pacific.  Duterte, unlike his predecessor, Benigno Aquino, has courted China and has been less critical of its island building in the region. Following the two-day APEC meeting from Nov 11, which U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend, Asia Pacific leaders will travel to the Philippines for the East Asia Summit, including representatives from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other Asia Pacific nations.  Duterte s visit will mark his second trip to Japan and his third meeting with Abe. ",worldnews,"October 25, 2017 ",1
"Japan's Abe may have won election, but many don't want him as PM","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may have won a major election victory on Sunday, but half the people surveyed post-election by the Asahi newspaper don t want him to stay prime minister. It seems the election victory has boosted the approval rating for Abe s administration, but not him. Public support rate for Abe s administration grew to 42 percent in the survey, conducted between Oct. 23 and 24, up from 38 percent in its previous survey in mid-Oct. But 47 percent of respondents don t want Abe to continue as prime minister, exceeding 37 percent who want him to stay, said the survey published on Wednesday. Abe s disapproval rating slipped to 39 percent from 40 percent, according to the Asahi s survey. Abe is due to remain prime minister until September 2018 when his tenure as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader ends and a new vote for LDP leader is held Abe s LDP-led coalition won a combined 313 seats in Sunday s national election, keeping its two-thirds  super majority  in the 465-member lower house, local media said. Several experts noted the ruling bloc s win was less a victory for the long-ruling LDP than a defeat for a divided opposition. The Asahi s survey also showed 51 percent of respondents said the number of seats the ruling bloc s won was  too many , while 32 percent expressed the seat number was good. And 54 percent of respondents said they were concerned about Abe s policies, exceeding 29 percent who said they have positive expectations, the Asahi said. A Yomiuri newspaper survey on Wednesday showed the approval rating for Abe s administration was up at 52 percent from 41 percent in its previous survey early this month. Asked reasons for the LDP s winning majority on its own, only six percent said it was  high hopes for Abe , 10 percent said  appreciation of ruling parties achievements  while 44 percent cited fragmentation of opposition, the Yomiuri said.

Demoralized and divided: inside Catalonia's police force,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - With the Spanish government ready to take over the running of Catalonia on Friday, the loyalty of the local police to Madrid or to the Catalan cause will be tested if they are ordered to drag their former political masters from office. Spanish police provoked international outcry by using batons and rubber bullets when they stepped in to try to stop an illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1 after the local Catalan force refused to prevent voting in what has become the worst constitutional crisis in modern Spanish history.  Catalonia s secessionist government is intent on resisting Spain s plan to remove it from power, and there are doubts over how a divided and demoralized Mossos d Esquadra, as the Catalan police are called, would respond if ordered to evict President Carles Puigdemont and his autonomous government by force.   National police could once again be on the front line. The local police force is riven by distrust between those for and against Catalan independence and is estranged from Spain s national police forces, according to interviews with Mossos officers and national police.  The Civil Guard gave evidence against the Mossos chief in a sedition inquiry after his force stood back and allowed voting to take place, court documents show.  Five Mossos officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they believed the 17,000-strong force was split among those who wanted independence and those who opposed it, with three of those saying they would not use force to remove ministers and lawmakers from power.  I m not going to use force and beat people with my baton if they are passive,  said a 15-year Mossos veteran and secessionist, who declined to be named.  He said many others felt the same, but added: I would have to obey it. My family has to eat.  A Mossos spokeswoman said the force was neutral and not subject to any  political or ideological criteria . Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is intent on thwarting the latest bid for independence by Catalonia, which has 16 percent of the Spanish population but generates 19 percent of the country s economic output, to avoid what he believes will bring economic and social turmoil to the heart of the eurozone.  Officers told Reuters there was also an anti-independence faction in the Mossos d Esquadra,  Lads  Squad  in Catalan, which uses an encrypted chat app to share views on independence versus allegiance to Madrid.   In a bid to impose its authority the Madrid government will replace the Mossos senior leadership, but the question is whether this will be enough to ensure the force s loyalty.     The Mossos stance will have a powerful influence on the 7.5 million Catalans as the force has deep roots in Catalan society, having emerged from citizen militias in the 18th century.  The Mossos s reputation was enhanced by its handling of an August van attack in Barcelona which killed 14 people.  Rajoy will seek Senate approval on Friday to take the unprecedented step of assuming central control of Catalonia, including its government and the running of Mossos. The strategy will replace the Mossos leadership, including its two senior officers and 23 commissioners, and route the chain of command to a national police commander, yet to be appointed, who will report to the interior ministry, officials in Madrid and a Catalan police union said. Spain s foreign minister, Alfonso Dastis, said at the weekend, before calls for civil disobedience by the Catalan government, that  we are not going to arrest anyone .  But a senior government source said force may be necessary depending on the reaction in Catalonia.  If the parliament has to be emptied out and closed, if the councillors  offices have to be cleared out - if they obey there s no problem, but if they don t obey it will have to be enforced,  the source said. The months-long standoff between Madrid and pro-independence leaders progressively damaged morale inside Mossos, with hundreds of officers opposed to independence looking to quit the force, officers and union officials say. Some complain they are sidelined by their pro-independence colleagues. Luis Miguel Lorente, head of the national ARP police union, said about 200 Mossos officers had contacted his union for information on how to join national police forces. Spain has sent about 4,000 police reinforcements to Catalonia, where protests on both sides of the independence debate have drawn hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets. Extra police have been billeted in two cruise ships in Barcelona harbor. One of the ships is painted with cartoon characters of Tweety Pie and Sylvester the Cat, leading to Tweety Pie being adopted as the mascot of the independence movement by some campaigners. Participants in the referendum opted overwhelmingly for independence, but turnout was only about 43 percent as Catalans who favor remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the ballot. Secessionists said the result gave them a mandate for statehood. Spain was only restored to democracy following the death in 1975 of dictator Francisco Franco, under whom the Catalan language and traditions were suppressed.    Protests have been peaceful, but the referendum showed how tensions can swiftly escalate when Madrid uses national police, despised by many secessionists, to enforce anti-independence measures. If Mossos stands back again, the senior government source said, national police would step in once more. A defiant Catalan government, which remains in power until the Senate approves Rajoy s plan, said this week its civil servants, including the Mossos, would continue to obey its instructions and those of its legislature. That raises fears that Puigdemont and regional lawmakers, will refuse to leave their offices, or that their supporters may try to help by occupying the offices. As well as replacing Mossos leaders, Madrid may also redeploy Mossos officers away from key government buildings and use national police instead, an interior ministry official said. Relations between the regional and the national forces are at rock bottom and no new joint investigations are being launched, say officers from each force.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
"China enshrines 'Xi Jinping Thought', key Xi ally to step down","BEIJING (Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party enshrined President Xi Jinping s political thought into its constitution on Tuesday, putting him in the same company as the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, and cementing his power ahead of a second five-year term. A key Xi ally, top corruption fighter Wang Qishan, will not be on the new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China, to be revealed on Wednesday as he was not among those named on Tuesday to the 204-member Central Committee. Whether or not the powerful Wang would remain on the Standing Committee, which currently has seven members, despite being beyond the customary retirement age of 69, had been among the key questions to be answered at the week-long party congress, which ended on Tuesday. Wang could still assume another senior role over the next few months. As expected, the party unanimously passed an amendment to include  Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era  as one of its guiding principles. The party will announce its new Standing Committee, headed by Xi, at around midday (0400 GMT) on Wednesday, culminating a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle. As expected, the amended constitution affirmed that Xi s signature fight against corruption, which has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials, will continue. Unexpectedly, Xi s  Belt and Road  initiative, an ambitious program to build infrastructure linking China with its neighbors and beyond, was also included in the party constitution. Also included was a commitment to supply-side industrial reforms, and giving play to the  decisive role  of market forces in resource allocation, a commitment Xi had made early in his first terms that many investors say he has failed to deliver on.  The party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country,  the party said in a statement reflecting Xi s ongoing efforts to strengthen the party and its place in contemporary Chinese society. If no clear successor to Xi is named to the new Politburo Standing Committee, it will further fuel speculation that Xi may look to retain power beyond the customary second five-year term.  This is about further erasing any distinction between Xi Jinping and the party,  said Jude Blanchette, who studies the party at The Conference Board s China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing, referring to Xi s thought getting into the constitution.   Add on to this having supply-side structural reform and One Belt One Road written into this, which were Xi s signature policies, this makes questioning or non-compliance with those tantamount to betrayal of the party.  Xu Hongcai, deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing think-tank, said party control was needed to push through the market reforms key to restructuring the world s second-largest economy.  To build a market economic system in such a big country, it s impossible without the leadership of the party,  he said. Others have argued that the two are contradictory.  When you put  supply-side reform  and  market playing a decisive role  in the same document, then that just shows they have to almost choose one,  said Alex Wolf, Senior Emerging Markets Economist with Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong. China s blue-chip shares climbed to a 26-month high on Tuesday, led by infrastructure and property stocks, as Xi wrapped up a congress that began with his three-and-a half hour speech envisioning a more prosperous, confident China. The yuan strengthened against the dollar. Xi rapidly consolidated power after assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year. The party gave Xi the title of  core  leader a year ago, a significant strengthening of his position. Whether Xi was able to have his name  crowned  in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.  No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng s name was added after his death in 1997. A list of 133 committee members for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection released on Tuesday included Zhao Leji, who heads the party s Organisation Department, a strong sign that he will take over from Wang as anti-corruption chief. China s top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, and veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang, front runners to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan as central bank governor, both made it to the Central Committee. The constitutional amendment, along with Xi s work report and a work report of the graft watchdog to the congress, were passed by a show of hands. When Xi next asked for any  no  votes or abstentions for the amendment or two work reports, the sound of  none  echoed throughout the chamber, as officials shouted out from different sides of the hall.

Factbox: Who's in? Who's out? China's Communist Party Central Committee,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party announced a new Central Committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies, at the closing session of the 19th Communist Party Congress on Tuesday, a course-setting leadership reshuffle held every five years. The list provides clues to who will, or won t, fill top party positions during President Xi Jinping s second term. The party will announce its new Politburo Standing Committee around midday (0400 GMT) on Wednesday. The Standing Committee, which now includes seven members headed by Xi and is the apex of power in China, is selected by the new Central Committee.  Here are noteworthy names: - Wang Qishan, 69, the anti-corruption tsar and current Standing Committee member, is not on the new Central Committee, ending months of speculation whether he would remain for another term and break an unofficial retirement rule of not taking a new position after age 68.  Wang may still get a leadership role outside the Standing Committee, sources told Reuters before the congress. - Zhao Leji, 60, head of the party s Organization Department, which oversees personnel decisions, made both the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Committee lists, suggesting he may take over Wang Qishan s role as top graft-buster. - Vice President Li Yuanchao, who is on the cusp of retirement at the age of 67, is expected to retire from the 25-member Politburo after he was not included on the 204-member Central Committee. - China s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, 67, could keep his state councilor job or be further promoted to parliament or its advisory body after he made it back to the Central Committee.  If Yang retires, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, 64 this month, and Song Tao, 62, minister of the party s International Liaison Department, are the top contenders for Yang s job. Both Wang and Song are Central Committee members. - Veteran diplomat Liu Jieyi, 59, China s permanent representative to the United Nations, was elected to the Central Committee and is expected to take over as minister of the Taiwan Affairs Office, replacing Zhang Zhijun, who is retiring. - Transport Minister Li Xiaopeng, 58, the oldest son of former premier Li Peng, became a full member of the Central Committee. He was the lowest vote-getter among alternate members of the Central Committee five years ago. - Ten women made it onto the committee, 4.9 percent of the total, basically the same proportion as the previous Central Committee. There were also 16 delegates from ethnic minorities, three of whom are women. - China s top banking regulator Guo Shuqing, veteran banker Jiang Chaoliang and securities regulator Liu Shiyu, the three front runners to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan as central bank governor, were all voted onto the Central Committee.

China unveils new leadership line-up with no clear successor to Xi,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party broke with recent precedent on Wednesday, unveiling a new leadership line-up without a clear successor to President Xi Jinping, who has become arguably the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Xi led his team in order of rank on to a stage at Beijing s Great Hall of the People, overlooking Tiananmen Square, culminating a week-long party conclave at which he laid out his  vision for an increasingly prosperous China confident of its place on the world stage.  Apart from Xi, Premier Li Keqiang was the only one to retain his spot amid sweeping changes on the Politburo Standing Committee. There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of his customary second five years in power, which began on Wednesday. All seven Standing Committee members are men in their 60s and, for the first time, none was born before China s 1949 Communist revolution. The make-up of the committee, which has ultimate control over the world s second-largest economy, appeared to be a compromise to include a blend of Xi allies and those considered loyal to party elders, including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, former presidents whose networks still wield influence. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, said Xi appeared to have traded securing favorable amendments to the constitution in exchange for a compromise on the make-up of the Standing Committee, a line-up he likened to a  team of rivals . The member considered closest to Xi is Li Zhanshu, who has often accompanied Xi on overseas trips in a chief-of-staff-style role as the head the party s General Office.  Li, who is not related to the premier, was named the third-ranked member, meaning he will most likely assume the role of head of the largely rubber-stamp parliament. That will not be confirmed until parliament meets in March. Xi had already strengthened his hand considerably ahead of the announcement, with his political theory and  Belt and Road  infrastructure-led development strategy put into the party constitution. He was named the party s  core  last year. Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua and Chongqing party boss Chen Miner had been previously seen as prominent contenders to succeed Xi among the party s so-called sixth generation of leaders but were not included in the Standing Committee. Instead, both were named to the wider 25-member Politburo, a rung below the Standing Committee.  He s consolidated his power without making unnecessary problems for himself,  said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.   The costs of keeping Wang Qishan or getting Chen Miner were too high. He didn t need to do it.  Wang, who led Xi s sweeping anti-graft campaign and was considered China s second most-powerful politician, is above retirement age; Chen was comparatively junior.  While the Standing Committee bears the hallmarks of compromise, the new Politburo is stacked with more than a dozen Xi allies, including Chen, Beijing party boss Cai Qi, economic adviser Liu He and Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to become Xi s chief of staff as director of the party s General Office.  Xi has managed to put a lot of his own people there, as much as possible,  said Bo Zhiyue, a New Zealand-based expert on Chinese politics.  Most of Xi s close associates are too junior to be put into the Politburo Standing Committee right away.  Blanket state media coverage made no mention of factional politics or alliances, while an editorial on the official People s Daily s WeChat account hailed the new seven-man line-up as a  dream team  to lead China into its  new era . Xi, who has sought to revitalize the Communist Party s role across Chinese society, made no mention of who his successor might be as he introduced his new Standing Committee at a media event broadcast live around the country. His remarks were translated consecutively into English. Xi did not take questions, but said the party had weathered trials and tribulations.  We will also work with other nations to build a global community with a shared future, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of peace and development for all humanity,  he said.  Xi and Li were first promoted to the Standing Committee at the 17th Party Congress in 2007, in a clear signal that the pair would succeed Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao and occupy the top two  offices - which they did five years later.  Zhao Leji, who headed the party s Organisation Department, which oversees personnel decisions, replaced Wang Qishan as chief of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

Peruvians take Glencore to court over police abuse allegations,"(Reuters) - Peruvian villagers suing miner Glencore will argue in London s High Court next week that the company should be held liable over their allegations they were abused by Peruvian police, the law firm representing them said on Tuesday. The allegations, to be presented in a 10-day hearing that starts on Monday, illustrates potential legal risks for mining companies that sign pacts with Peruvian police for the provision of security services at their operations. The lawsuit by 22 Peruvians said that Xstrata, acquired by Glencore in 2013, failed to take reasonable steps to prevent abuses by police in deadly protests at the Tintaya copper mine in 2012, said London law firm Leigh Day. Xstrata paid, fed and provided lodging for police and knew or should have known that Peru s police tend to use excessive force, Leigh Day said. Glencore said Xstrata was not responsible for actions taken by the Peruvian National Police (PNP) in policing the protests and noted that the lawsuit does not allege that Xstrata or the mine s private security force harmed anyone. Xstrata  appealed to the PNP to respect the human rights of protesters before and during the protest,  Glencore said in a statement. Like many mining companies in Peru, Xstrata had signed an agreement with Peru s national police for the provision of security services at Tintaya, which stopped operating in 2013. The agreements, which usually include payment for police, have long been criticized by activists who say it creates a police force loyal to companies instead of the broader public.     Defenders of the agreements say that they allow companies to pay for their policing needs in poor, remote regions where they tend to operate alongside villages that lack basic services. Leigh Day law firm said that a Peruvian villager believed to have been shot by police in the 2012 unrest will attend the hearing. The case will be determined under Peruvian law, the firm said.

German parties in coalition talks agree on no new debt,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Politicians from four German parties seeking to form a first-of-its-kind coalition government agreed on Tuesday not to increase the country s debt load in order to fund sought-after tax cuts, subsidies and investments. Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU), their Christian Social Union (CSU) allies, the liberal Free Democrats and the Greens held a second round of talks after an election last month that saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) enter parliament for the first time. The four parties are under pressure to find common ground on contentious issues such as the future of the euro zone and immigration policy, as well as fiscal policy. A paper seen by Reuters that outlines their initial agreement on state spending showed the potential coalition partners want to cut taxes for families with children as well as lower- and middle-income people. They also want to abolish the  solidarity tax , introduced after reunification to support poorer states in eastern Germany, which is due to expire in 2019. The Greens, who before the talks said they opposed sticking to a balanced budget at any cost, appear to have conceded in exchange for a common pledge for subsidies to home owners who make their domiciles more energy efficient. Merkel s CDU and their Bavarian CSU allies lost support in the election to the anti-immigrant AfD, as the party stole many conservative voters angry at her 2015 decision to welcome more than one million migrants into Germany. Weakened after the Sept. 24 vote, Merkel is now seeking to form a four-way coalition untested at the national level that will secure her a fourth term as chancellor.  We are very satisfied with the (talks) this evening,  CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber told reporters after the talks.  It was a very good evening.  His positive assessment of the second round of exploratory talks was shared by counterparts from the CSU, FDP and Greens. A report by Merkel s CDU last week found that Germany s next government would have less fiscal room than expected. It also determined that the next government would have only 30 billion euros ($35.29 billion) free for new projects over the next four years if there is no new debt taken on - as has been the case since 2014.  The four parties  demands amount to over 100 billion euros in additional spending. The initial fiscal blueprint agreed on Tuesday did not say how the parties will fund their projects. It said they would explore fiscal flexibility measures at later rounds of talks. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

Brazil's top court suspends controversial slavery decree,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s Supreme Court has suspended a decree issued by President Michel Temer s government changing the definition of slavery that was widely condemned as a reversal in the fight against forced labor. In her decision taken on Monday and made public on Tuesday, Justice Rosa Weber said the decree s reduction of the scope of what is considered slave labor violated the constitution. Weber also argued that the measure could hurt Brazil s trade relations since other countries could complain that slave labor was a form of unfair competition. Faced with an outpouring of criticism, the government said on Friday that it would pull the decree and issue a new one. In Brazil, forced labor has been defined as a form of modern-day slavery. This includes debt bondage, degrading work conditions, and long work hours that pose a risk to a worker s health or life, and violate their dignity. Human rights campaigners said the decree issued by the labor ministry on Monday changed the way slavery was defined, limiting it to a victim s freedom of movement but disregarding other abuses. The decree, supported by Brazil s powerful farm lobby, would derail enforcement efforts that have freed 50,000 workers from slavery-like conditions since 1995, federal prosecutors and labor inspectors said. Temer opponents said he bowed to pressure from the farm lobby to modify the decree at a time when he is relying on the group s votes in Congress on Wednesday to block corruption charges against him.  In exchange for support to escape a criminal trial, Temer promised the farm lobby goods he cannot deliver,  said lawmaker Alessandro Molon of the leftist Sustainability Network, the party that asked the court to stop the decree. Molon called the slave labor decree one the most  abject bargains  in the country s history. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Brazil's Temer makes concessions to survive in office,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s President Michel Temer has made policy and spending concessions in an effort to survive a congressional vote on corruption charges Wednesday that has put his reform agenda at risk, analysts and political actors said. To please the powerful farm lobby that has two-fifths of the votes in the lower house, Temer agreed to lower fines for environmental damage. He attempted to relax a definition of slave labor but was forced to backtrack after an outcry. In the clearest move to favor an ally, the Republican Party that has 37 seats in the 512-seat chamber and runs the Transport Ministry, Temer removed Sao Paulo s busy and lucrative Congonhas airport from a list of airports to be privatized. The party has appointees in the ministry and state airport operator Infraero. Critics and political observers say Temer has sacrificed austerity policies to save his presidency but will emerge from Wednesday s vote a weakened leader unable to pass substantial measures, such as an overhaul of the pension system. Temer faces charges in a bribery case based on testimony by an owner of the world s largest meatpacker JBS SA that has implicated several of his cabinet ministers. The lower house decides whether a president should stand trial before the Supreme Court, which can only take place if two-thirds of deputies vote for it.   He will survive because he has a majority, though not my vote because I believe there is enough evidence to put him on trial by the Supreme Court,  said Fabio Sousa, a lawmaker of the centrist the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), a member of Temer s governing coalition. Temer managed to block a first corruption charge in August. Now he faces charges of obstruction of justice and criminal organization for allegedly receiving bribes from JBS. Temer has met with dozens of lawmakers in recent days to secure their votes. Presidential aides said he hopes to widen his margin of support so that he can move ahead with his reforms, paralyzed for six months by the political crisis. Those votes come at a cost, in pork-barrel spending. According to public spending watchdog Contas Abertas, Temer fast-tracked spending in congressional districts worth 4.4 billion reais ($1.3 billion) to help win the first vote, and is now hitting the 2 billion real mark ahead of Wednesday s vote. O Globo newspaper estimated the cost of Temer s handouts to taxpayers at 12 billion reais, half of which would have come  from the planned airport concession auction. Yet most analysts believe Temer will get less votes this time, because lawmakers have started to distance themselves from his government ahead of next year s general elections.  After this vote, Temer will become a lame duck president. It will be very difficult for him to pass any reforms,  said David Fleischer, politics professor emeritus at Brasilia University. Investors are waiting to see if Temer can deliver a pension reform to tackle a budget deficit that cost brazil its investment grade credit rating.  If he does get social security reform approved, it will be badly watered down,  Fleischer said. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Morocco's king fires ministers over slow progress in restive tribal area,"RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco s king dismissed several ministers and top officials on Tuesday for failing to improve the economic situation in a region shaken by protests, a statement said. Protests erupted in the Rif region around the northern city of Al-Hoceima last October, triggered by the death of a fishmonger whose produce was confiscated by police.  The man s crushing to death in a garbage truck during a confrontation with police became a symbol of corruption and official abuse. Protests, also fueled by economic underdevelopment, continued there this year. Morocco s King Mohammed dismissed the ministers of education, planning and housing and health, as well as other officials, after an economic agency found  imbalances  in implementing a development plan, state news agency MAP reported, citing a palace statement. Political protests are rare in Morocco, where the palace remains the ultimate power. The protests, the largest in Morocco since the days of the 2011  Arab Spring , were directed at the government and the king s entourage rather than the monarch himself. The king s move came as protest leader Nasser Zefzafi and 29 others accused of organizing demonstrations in the northern region went on trial in Casablanca. They face charges ranging from conspiring against the state to protesting without authorization. Zefzaki s lawyer told Reuters he could be sentenced to death in a worst-case scenario. The judge adjourned the session until Oct 31. Zefzaki s supporters protested in front of the court while some 70 lawyers attended the trial. The protest movement was born after Fikri s death. Police confiscated fish they said he had bought illegally and dumped it in a garbage truck. Desperate to recover his stock, Fikri jumped inside and was killed by a rubbish crusher. In July the king pardoned dozens of people arrested in the protests and blamed the failure of local officials to quickly implement development projects for stoking public anger.

Mozambique's president dismisses head of intelligence and army chief,"MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique has fired its head of intelligence and army chief of staff, two weeks after 16 people were killed in attacks in the north of the country, the presidency said on Tuesday.  Lagos Lidimo was dismissed as director general of information and state security service; he will be replaced by Julio Jane, previously the commander of police, Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi said in a statement. Gra a Chongo has been dismissed as army chief, with no replacement named.  The presidency did not provide reasons for the dismissals, which were effective immediately.  Earlier this month, police and unidentified gunmen clashed in the Indian Ocean port of Mocimboa da Praia, leaving 16 people dead, two of them police officers. The motive for the attacks was not clear. Local media have reported that the attack was carried out by Islamists, but the government has not confirmed that. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
"New wave of cyber attacks hits Russia, other nations","KIEV/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Cyber attacks using malware called  BadRabbit  hit Russia and other nations on Tuesday, affecting Russian Interfax news agency and causing flight delays at Ukraine s Odessa airport. While no major outages were reported, the U.S. government issued a warning on the attack, which followed campaigns in May and June that used similar malware and resulted in what some economists estimated are billions of dollars in losses. The attacks are disturbing because attackers quickly infected critical infrastructure, including transportation operators, indicating it was a  well-coordinated  campaign, said  Robert Lipovsky, a researcher with cyber firm ESET. More than half the victims were in Russia, followed by Ukraine, Bulgaria, Turkey and Japan, according to ESET.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning on the BadRabbit ransomware, a type of virus that locks up infected computers and asks victims to pay a ransom to restore access. It did not identify any U.S. victims but advised the public to refrain from paying ransoms and report any infections to the Federal Bureau of Investigation through the government s Internet Crime Complaint Center. Ransomware infections have the potential to halt activity at targeted organizations. The May  WannaCry  ransomware shuttered hospitals, factories and other facilities around the globe for days.  Interfax, one of Russia s largest news agencies, said some of its services were hit by the attack but expected them to be back online by the end of Tuesday. An Odessa airport spokesman said a few flights were delayed because workers had to process passenger data manually. Kiev s metro system reported a hack on its payment system but said trains were running normally.  Ukraine s cyber police chief told Reuters the country was  barely affected.  Russian cyber-security firm Kaspersky Lab said BadRabbit appeared to spread through a mechanism similar to June s destructive NotPetya virus, which took down many Ukrainian government agencies and businesses. It then spread across corporate networks of multinationals with operations or suppliers in eastern Europe. Kaspersky said it was investigating to see whether BadRabbit was related to NotPetya.  Ukrainian banking services, which have been hit by previous attacks, were unaffected, according to the nation s central bank. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

Earlier this month, the Senate approved greater discounts to taxpayers in the program, depriving the cash-strapped government of about 3 billion reais. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
"Argentina midterm vote leaves Peronism divided, leaderless","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The victory of Argentine President Mauricio Macri s coalition in midterm elections on Sunday marked a resounding defeat of Peronism, one of Latin America s best-known political movements, leaving it divided and with no clear leader. In particular, a win by Macri s candidate over former President Cristina Fernandez in Buenos Aires province, the cradle of Peronism, diminishes her chances of returning to the presidency in 2019 and opens the door to a new era of business friendly reforms. While it is too soon to call the end of Peronism as a political force, the  Let s Change  movement founded by Macri, a former businessman and soccer mogul, has introduced a generation of new politicians who are less interested in dwelling on the emotion and imagery of Argentina s past than their predecessors.  We know that if we win, there will be renewal in Congress, but above all that people will accept that the country has changed,  Macri s chief campaign strategist Jaime Duran Barba said in a recent interview ahead of the election. He pointed to Buenos Aires governor, 44-year-old Maria Eugenia Vidal, and 51-year-old Buenos Aires City Mayor, Horacio Rodriguez Larreta, both from Macri s coalition, as examples of the leaders of the future. Macri s coalition won close to 42 percent of the national vote on Sunday, when Argentina elected a third of the Senate and half the lower chamber. That still leaves Macri short of a majority in Congress but new alliances should enable him to pass tax, capital market and labor reforms. Fernandez, who succeeded her late husband Nestor Kirchner in 2007, won two presidential elections thanks to nationalist appeals and generous social welfare programs.  She drew comparisons to Eva Peron, whose support for the country s poor means she is still adored by many working class Argentines 65 years after her death.  Evita,  as she is known worldwide, was the wife of General Juan Peron, the founder of the Peronist movement. Focused on workers  rights, its economic policies have veered from protectionist to free-market and it defies easy classification. In different forms, it has been Argentina s dominant political force since the 1940s. Argentina s electoral list system guaranteed Fernandez a Senate seat and some political influence with her second-place finish, but she lost by more than four percentage points to Macri s little-known former education minister in the bellwether province that is home to nearly 40 percent of voters. In October, 57 percent of Buenos Aires province citizens said they would never vote for Fernandez, according to a poll by Management & Fit. Pollster Poliarquia said that, nationwide, 53 percent of Argentines have a negative view of Fernandez, while 30 percent have a positive view.  Many Argentines blame Fernandez for isolating them economically with protectionist policies and cutting the country off from international capital markets. Now the center of a number of corruption investigations, Fernandez personally denies committing graft, though she admits there may have been corruption in her government.   Peronism today is rebuilding itself, leaving behind a very negative era,  said Enrique Zuleta Puceiro, director of pollster OPSM.  There are not any leaders with high levels of national influence.  With less clout in Congress, moderate Peronist governors are weighing joining Macri s reform agenda or abandoning their political careers. They have distanced themselves from Fernandez, who formed a new party for the election. Macri told Reuters in August that he could negotiate with a new generation of Peronist governors like Juan Manuel Urtubey of Salta and Sergio Unac of San Juan, who worked with him to reach an agreement to cut spending.  If Peronism does not renew itself it is destined to disappear,  Urtubey told Perfil newspaper, before his coalition in Salta lost heavily to Macri s allies in the election. Since taking office in late 2015, Macri has worked to literally dismantle Peronist symbols, taking down portraits and closing museums to get rid of their cultural legacies. However, given its historical weight and habit of renovation, most analysts say it is too soon to write Peronism s obituary.  Giving up Peronism for dead, thinking it will remain fragmented and confused until 2019, I believe is an error,  said Marcos Buscaglia, founding partner at Buenos Aires political and economic consultancy Alberdi Partners.  Paula Alonso, director of the Latin American and Hemispheric Studies Program at George Washington University, said Argentina s former Peronist leaders - including Peron himself, Carlos Menem, and the Kirchners - had generally risen swiftly to power from relative obscurity.      It s unpredictable in many ways, and therefore it is always relevant,  she said.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Iran sentences 'Mossad agent' to death over scientist killings,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran has sentenced to death a person found guilty of providing information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists, Tehran s prosecutor said on Tuesday. Dolatabadi did not identify the defendant, but Amnesty International said on Monday that Ahmadreza Djalali, an Iranian doctor who studied and taught in Sweden, had been sentenced to death in Iran on espionage charges. At least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what Tehran said was a program of assassinations aimed at sabotaging its nuclear energy program. Iran hanged one man in 2012 over the killings, saying he had links to Israel. On the latest conviction, Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi told the judiciary s news agency:  The person had several meetings with (Israeli intelligence agency) Mossad and provided them with sensitive information about Iran s military and nuclear sites in return for money and residency in Sweden.   The headline of the report described the convicted person as a  Mossad agent . Amnesty said the court verdict against Djalali stated that he had worked with the Israeli government which then helped him obtain a Swedish residency permit.  Neither Iran nor Amnesty said when the verdict was issued. Sweden condemned the sentence and said it had raised the matter with Iranian representatives in Stockholm and Tehran.  We condemn the use of the death penalty in all its forms. The death penalty is an inhuman, cruel and irreversible punishment that has no place in modern law,  Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said in an emailed comment. Djalali, a doctor and lecturer at Stockholm medical university the Karolinska Institute, was arrested in April 2016 and held without access to a lawyer for seven months, three of which were in solitary confinement, according to London-based Amnesty.   Djalali was sentenced to death after a grossly unfair trial that once again exposes not only the Iranian authorities  steadfast commitment to (the) use of the death penalty but their utter contempt for the rule of law,  said Philip Luther, Amnesty s Middle East advocacy director. The United States has denied Iran s accusation that it was involved in the scientists  deaths, while Israel has a policy of not commenting on such allegations. Dolatabadi said the convicted person gave Mossad information about 30 nuclear and military scientists including Massoud Ali Mohammadi, who was killed by a remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside his home in Tehran. The judiciary said the defendant was also linked to the assassination of nuclear engineer Majid Shahriari, killed in a bomb attack in November 2010. Djalali s wife Vida Mehrannia, who lives in Sweden with their two children, has told Amnesty that his physical and mental health has sharply deteriorated since he was detained.   We are calling for his release because he has not committed any crime,  Amnesty quoted her as saying. The vice-chancellor of the Karolinska Institute, where Djalali received his PhD in disaster medicine in 2012, said he was deeply concerned.  For many years, he has worked with researchers from all over the world to improve the capacity of hospitals in countries suffering from extreme poverty or affected by disasters and armed conflicts,  Ole Petter Ottersen said in a statement published on the university s website.  We ask that Dr Djalali be subjected to due process and fair trial.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

"Amid visa row, Turkey's Justice Ministry cancels U.S. visit","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey s Justice Ministry said on Tuesday it had canceled a planned study visit to the United States due to the widening diplomatic row between the countries over the issuing of visas. Local media earlier reported that U.S. authorities had rejected visa requests from members of the delegation, but the Justice Ministry said it had taken the initiative and canceled the trip.  Due to the recent visa crisis between the two countries, the visit was canceled by our Ministry,  it said in a statement, adding that there were no visa applications to be rejected. The delegation had planned a study visit to the United States, at the invitation of U.S. authorities, between Oct. 29 and Nov. 4, the ministry said. The pro-government Daily Sabah newspaper said the delegation had planned to study the U.S. penal system and visit American prisons.  Washington this month stopped issuing visas at its missions in Turkey, citing safety concerns for its staff following the arrest of two U.S. consular staff, both Turkish nationals.  The crisis has weighed on the lira currency and alarmed some investors. On Tuesday, a group of leading Turkish and U.S. businesses urged both governments to resolve the dispute. In May, a translator at the U.S. consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and, more recently, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) worker was detained in Istanbul. Both are accused of links to last year  failed coup. The U.S. embassy has said the accusations are baseless. Turkish police want to question a third worker based in Istanbul. His wife and daughter were detained over alleged links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the abortive putsch. They were later released. Turkey has been angered by what it sees as U.S. reluctance to hand over the cleric Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999. U.S. officials have said its courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition Gulen denies any involvement in the failed coup. More than 150,000 people in the police, civil service and private sector have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the crackdown that followed the failed putsch. Some 50,000 have been detained.  Rights groups and Turkey s Western allies have expressed concern that Turkey using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. Ankara says the measures are necessary, given the extent of the security threat it faces.   Turkey has also been enraged by Washington s support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

U.S. weighs calling Myanmar's Rohingya crisis 'ethnic cleansing',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department is considering formally declaring the crackdown on Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims to be ethnic cleansing, U.S. officials said on Tuesday, as lawmakers called for sanctions against the Southeast Asian country s military. Pressure has mounted for a tougher U.S. response to the Rohingya crisis ahead of President Donald Trump s maiden visit to Asia next month when he will attend a summit of Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, in Manila. U.S. officials are preparing a recommendation for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that would define the military-led campaign against the Rohingya as ethnic cleansing, which could spur new sanctions, the U.S. government sources said. The proposal - part of an overall review of Myanmar policy - could be sent to Tillerson as early as this week, and he would then decide whether to adopt it, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Rakhine state in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, mostly to neighboring Bangladesh, since security forces responded to Rohingya militants  attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown. The United Nations has already denounced it as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. Three U.S. officials testifying at a Senate hearing on Tuesday declined to say whether the treatment of the Rohingya  was ethnic cleansing, but listed new measures including targeted sanctions that Washington is considering. Those steps, however, stopped short of the most drastic tools at Washington s disposal such as reimposing broader economic sanctions suspended under the Obama administration.  I m not in a position ... to characterize it today, but to me this very closely resembles some of the worst kind of atrocities that I ve seen during a long career,  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mark Storella said when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing. Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said he considered the treatment of the Rohingya  genocide  and is working on bipartisan legislation that could spell out whether additional sanctions are needed. Myanmar, also known as Burma, insists that action was needed to combat  terrorists.  The recommendation to Tillerson - first reported by the Associated Press - is not expected to include a determination on whether  crimes against humanity  have been committed, as this would require further legal deliberations, one U.S. official said.  The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some U.S. lawmakers criticized Aung San Suu Kyi, head of Myanmar s civilian-led government and a Nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in Washington, for failing to do more. Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the committee, chided Suu Kyi for what he called  dismissiveness  toward the plight of the Rohingya and said it might be time for a  policy adjustment  toward Myanmar. At the hearing, Patrick Murphy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian And Pacific Affairs, said additional  sanctions were being considered, but cautioned that doing so could lessen Washington s ability to influence Myanmar.

Africa eyes senior Trump envoy visit for U.S. policy hints,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley arrived in Ethiopia on Monday, one of the first senior members of President Donald Trump s administration to visit Africa, on a trip diplomats hope will shed light on his plans to engage with the continent. Africa is traditionally overshadowed by more urgent issues, and the Trump administration has so far been hands-off. After meetings on Monday with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and a senior African Union official, Haley told reporters she hoped this was the beginning of  a stronger relationship with the AU and our African partners.    The United States very much sees Africa as a very important part of the world. We see great opportunities in Africa, we see challenges in Africa, but we want to support and help in those situations,  Haley said.    But most importantly we want to see how we can partner together, whether that is through economic development, whether it is through strategic practices, whether it s through political solutions,  she said.  Trump has been vocal about North Korea, Iran and tackling Islamic State militants during his first nine months in office, but said little about Africa until he held a lunch last month with nine leaders on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. It was there he announced he would send Haley to South Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo to help with efforts to broker peace in both countries. Millions of people have been displaced by ongoing violence, with U.N. peacekeeping missions deployed in both, each costing more than $1 billion annually. Haley plans to take a critical look at the U.N. operations during her visits. Haley said she also plans to meet with South Sudan President Salva Kiir and Congolese President Joseph Kabila to  deliver a strong message that their governments need to stop making the work of aid workers and peace-keepers more difficult.  Some African diplomats hope Haley s trip will spark a conversation in Washington on the administration s broader engagement with Africa.   We hope that after this trip the administration will sit down and maybe before the end of the year we can hear their Africa strategy,  said a senior African diplomat at the United Nations, speaking on condition of anonymity.  We would have wished it was earlier, but it s never too late.  Haley s visit to Africa comes after four U.S. soldiers were killed during an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger.  The Niger crisis has shown that they can t take a hands-off approach to (Africa). They have to remain engaged because they have boots on the ground,  said a second senior African diplomat at the United Nations, also speaking on condition of anonymity. At his lunch with African leaders, Trump said there was  tremendous business potential  and he has friends  trying to get rich  in Africa. But he also noted the threat from militants such as Islamic State, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram and al Qaeda.  The United States is proud to work with you to eradicate terrorist safe havens,  he said.  And a number of you have told me ... that we ve been doing a very good job over the last six or seven months in particular.  However, in June the United States said it did not want the United Nations to fund a proposed African force to fight Islamist militants in West Africa, U.N. diplomats said. France on Friday pushed Washington to step up support for the force so it does not fail, leaving French troops to carry the burden. Haley has been campaigning to cut U.N. peacekeeping costs, since the United States is the largest contributor. U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad Al Hussein bluntly summed up U.S. global engagement on Thursday as  caught somewhere between isolationism and militarism, with no clear direction in foreign policy apart from a few notable, exceptional, files.  As with most of the key regional bureaus at the U.S. State Department, there is currently no permanent chief diplomat for Africa. Rather, the Bureau of African Affairs is led by career diplomat Don Yamamoto as an acting assistant secretary of state. While Yamamoto is an experienced Africa hand, diplomats say that leading any of the agency s regional bureaus in an acting capacity means that an official is not perceived abroad as having the full backing of the White House and has more limited influence at home within the U.S. bureaucracy.  They seem to be relying very heavily on their ambassadors on the ground and not having a Washington-centric approach to their relationship with Africa,  said the second diplomat.  Haley s colleague in Trump s cabinet, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, traveled to the West African nation of Togo in August to review a free trade pact with sub-Saharan Africa, but talks ended with no decision. In April Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited an important U.S. military base in Djibouti. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Portugal government survives no confidence vote over fires,"LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal s government on Tuesday survived a no confidence vote in parliament called by the opposition which alleged the government had failed to protect the lives of 110 people who died in two wildfire tragedies in the past four months. This year s fires in Portugal - one in June which killed 65 people and others last week which overwhelmed fire-fighting services and killed 45 people - are the worst on record and led to the resignation of the interior minister. The motion was presented by the center-right CDS-PP after a  barrage of criticism of the Socialist government of Prime Minister Antonio Costa. But the Socialists, together with their far-left parliamentary allies, the Communists and Left Bloc, rejected the motion in parliament by 122 to 105. The lethal wildfires are the biggest challenge faced by the government since it came to power in 2015 and have highlighted a glaring divide between the poor, abandoned interior of Portugal and its coastal, urban centers.   The government failed because its political leaders didn t know how to coordinate or execute a policy capable of stopping the fires,  CDS-PP party leader Assuncao Cristas told parliament during the debate.  Thousands of Portuguese waited for help which never came.  The government says extraordinary weather conditions, including unusually strong winds and extreme drought, made the fires very difficult to avoid. Portugal s yearly summer fires rarely kill civilians. Facing a growing backlash, including protests and demands for action by the president, the government announced a series of measures at the weekend.  We are here because the suffering of the victims and their families and the feeling of insecurity of the Portuguese demands a response,  Prime Minister Costa told parliament during the debate on the motion.  A report on the fire in June pointed to a long list of mistakes, including slow response times by the police, firefighters and civil protection agency. A special communication system for emergencies stopped working during the fire. This year s fires in Portugal accounted for 60 percent of the total area burnt in the entire European Union. Portugal is equal to 2.1 percent of the EU s landmass. In the interior, many have clamored for years for deep changes to land management to prevent fires, by creating viable forestry and farm units that will make land more valuable.

Italy calls confidence votes in Senate on new electoral law,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni s government on Tuesday called a series of confidence votes to pass a new electoral law as the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is likely to be hurt by the new legislation, pledged to protest on the streets. The government is resorting to the confidence votes to avoid secret voting in the Senate, where it has a narrow majority and at least four members of the ruling Democratic Party have said they will not cast a ballot. The confidence votes will be held by open ballot starting on Wednesday afternoon, with the final confidence vote to be held on Thursday. The government is forced to resign if it loses such a vote.  A centrist group that is not formally part of the government s majority has said it will provide up to 10 votes to help pass the law if needed. The bill, dubbed the Rosatellum, is supported by the Democratic Party (PD) and mainstream center-right opposition parties. It favors parties which group together ahead of the election.  It is likely to hurt 5-Star, which refuses to join any alliance, and left-wing parties that do not want to join a coalition with the PD. The 5-Star Movement, which tops many opinion polls, has called a street protest in front of the Senate for Wednesday afternoon, against what it sees as an attempt by its mainstream rivals to scupper its chances at the election.  It will be joined by the leftist Democratic and Progressive Movement (MDP), which split from the PD this year, and other small left-wing groups.   Apart from the PD, the legislation is supported by Silvio Berlusconi s center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the right-wing Northern League. The Rosatellum is the best compromise possible among political adversaries, according to the PD parliamentary party leader, Ettore Rosato, after whom the reform has been named. In two separate rulings, the Constitutional Court struck down previous laws, leaving the upper and lower houses with different rules. President Sergio Mattarella has called on parliament to come up with a mew electoral law that applies equally to both houses before a national vote, due by May of next year.  All previous attempts to harmonize the rules have failed, most recently in June when dissident deputies used a secret vote to up-end part of the proposed legislation. While the current law would harmonize rules for both houses, polls suggest it will not hand any coalition or party a clear mandate to govern.  The proposed election law would distribute almost two-thirds of the seats in parliament on a proportional basis, while a third would be decided in a first-past-the-post vote on specific candidates. Coalitions would need to get 10 percent of the national vote to get into parliament, while parties running alone would need only 3 percent. Candidates would be chosen by party chiefs.

"Macron avoids 'lecturing' Egypt on rights, Sisi defends his record","PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday it was not up to him to  lecture  Egypt on civil liberties, but told its visiting leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that strengthening human rights was in its interest. Sisi, denying accusations by human rights groups that he had allowed his forces to use torture, told a Paris news conference:  We do not practice torture and ... we must be wary of all the information published by rights organizations.  With both France and Egypt concerned by the political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt, the two countries have cultivated even closer economic and military ties during Sisi s rise to power. But rights organizations have accused France under Macron of turning a blind eye to what they say are increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi s government as the 2018 presidential elections approach.  I believe in the sovereignty of states, and therefore, just as I don t accept being lectured on how to govern my country, I don t lecture others,  Macron said at a joint news conference with Sisi in Paris following talks.  My deeply held conviction is that it s in President Sisi s interest to accompany the defense and consolidation of human rights by the Egyptian state, in the context that only he can be the judge of,  the French president said. During their 50-minute meeting, Macron brought up the issue of a dozen cases of alleged abuses of freedoms, in particular relating to Egyptian journalists and human rights activists, sources close to Macron said. Sisi, replying to journalists  questions, said he was responsible for 100 million Egyptians who lived in turbulent times and alongside people who followed  extremist thought  and did not like to co-exist in peace.  When it comes to human rights, we re not evading an answer but I hope that we understand it in its true context of a country in Egypt s situation. We are not in Europe, with its intellectual, cultural, civilization and human advancement. We re in a different region.   In a report in September, Human Rights Watch (HRW) denounced  widespread and systematic  use of torture by Egyptian security forces. The United Nations on Oct. 13 condemned an anti-gay crackdown in Egypt. It also slammed French  indulgence  towards repression in Egypt. Rights  groups accuse France of abandoning principles in favor of economic and security interests. They are particularly critical of the relationship between Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian who in his previous role as defense minister developed a personal relationship with Sisi.  French officials dismiss the criticism and say the new administration is following a policy of not openly criticizing countries over human rights so as to be more effective in private and work on a case by case basis. Reacting to a lack of progress in respecting human rights and on democratic standards, the United States decided in August to freeze the payment of $195 million in military aid to Egypt. Under the previous government, France concluded several major military agreements with Egypt, including the sale of 24 Rafale combat aircraft, a multi-mission frigate and two Mistral warships in contracts worth some six billion euros. France will discuss the possible sale of more Rafale aircrafts with Sisi, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier on Tuesday. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
South Africa's Zuma asks court to reject call for inquiry into influence-peddling,"PRETORIA (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma has asked the High Court to reject a call by an anti-corruption watchdog for an official inquiry into alleged influence-peddling in his government. A report a year ago by South Africa s anti-graft agency known as Public Protector recommended a judicial probe be held to look into allegations of systemic corruption by Zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies. The report focused on allegations that Zuma s friends, businessman brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. The 75-year-old Zuma, whose rule has long been dogged by scandal, and the Gupta brothers have denied the accusations. The president, who previously described the  State of Capture  report as  unfair  in parliament, wants the court to send it back to the watchdog for further investigations. He questioned the right of the report s author, Public Protector former head Thuli Madonsela, to call for a judicial inquiry. The report, whose public release Zuma had sought to block through the courts, called for an inquiry be set up by the president and for a judge to be appointed within 30 days of its release.  Is she competent to then direct the president to hold a commission on inquiry? With respect to this submission, she s not,  Zuma s lawyer Ishmael Semenya told the court, referring to Madonsela. The hearing is expected to continue until Thursday and a ruling is expected at a later date. Zuma this year faced a series of corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest the Gupta brothers may have used their influence to secure state contracts for their companies. Zuma and the Gupta brothers have denied these allegations. Separately, Zuma is facing the possibility of more court charges. The Supreme Court this month upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against him before he became president in 2009. The National Prosecuting Authority is expected to make a decision on whether to charge Zuma. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Russia vetoes extension of mission probing chemical weapons use in Syria,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia cast a veto at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday preventing the renewal of the mandate for a mission that investigates the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) - was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November. The JIM is due to report by Oct. 26 on who was responsible for an attack on April 4 on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, held by the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, that killed dozens of people. Russia wanted to discuss the report before voting on the extension of the mandate, and its U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia unsuccessfully asked to postpone the vote.  Don t try to create the impression that the JIM will be a dead letter unless we adopt this resolution today,  Nebenzia said prior to the vote.  We are ready to return to extending the JIM after the publication of the report and after we discuss it after the 26 of October.  A separate OPCW fact-finding mission determined in June that the banned nerve agent sarin had been used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base.  Russia has once again demonstrated it will do whatever it takes to ensure the barbaric Assad regime never faces consequences for its continued use of chemicals as weapons,  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, traveling in Africa, said in a statement. After the vote, Nebenzia said the elimination of chemical weapons in Syria had nearly finished. In its most recent report late last month, the OPCW said it had verified the destruction of 25 of the 27 chemical weapons production facilities declared by Syria and continued to prepare an inspection to confirm the current condition of the last two. China abstained from Tuesday s vote, while Bolivia joined Russia in voting no. Eleven countries voted in favor of the text. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Missing persons agency opens high-tech global HQ in Netherlands,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The organization that identified tens of thousands of victims from the Balkan wars of the 1990s opened a new global headquarters in the Netherlands on Tuesday from where it will take on new cases around the world. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP), established after the 1995 Srebrenica genocide, will use the latest DNA technology to identify bodies and give families of the missing closure.  There are millions of reported cases of missing persons worldwide, with as many as a million in Iraq, tens of thousands in Syria and Lebanon and many more from Colombia to the Philippines.   The numbers are staggering,  said ICMP head Kathyrne Bomberger.  Moving here increases the perception that we are a global organization and understand that the issue of missing persons itself is a huge global problem that isn t just in the western Balkans.   The ICMP, which has identified 20,000 remains and provided evidence in 30 criminal trials, will continue to work with war crimes courts in The Hague, including the genocide trial of former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, who will hear a verdict next month. The advanced application of DNA technology, which has now made it possible to use samples from distant family members to create comparable DNA profiles, could also be used to help identify undocumented migrants.   We are now on the brink of a new level of being able to roll out this possibility to missing migrants, including the 10,000 children missing in Europe,  she said.  Normally when people go missing from conflict or human rights abuses they are never found.  The ICMP has been asked by Italy to help identify around 8,000 bodies of migrants who drowned trying to get to Europe, but it does not yet have the funding. One family member the organization has helped find closure is Ingrid Gudmundsson. The 72-year-old grandmother lost her pregnant daughter Linda and 1-year-old granddaughter Mira when the 2005 Indian Ocean Tsunami hit the Khao Lak resort in Thailand.   Everything changed in my life,  she said in an interview ahead of the opening.  What does a mother do when her family is missing on the other side of the earth?  Her granddaughter Mira was too young to have dental records, so she provided the laboratory with a toy from which a DNA profile was compiled.  It was very important to get them identified, all of them,  she said, recalling the agony of weeks when they were missing.  Now I have them together in the same place.

Kenya police disperse protesters as Odinga tempers vote protest call,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police fired teargas and shots in the air to scatter a small number of demonstrators in Nairobi two days before elections, as the main opposition leader appeared to pull back from a call for protests during the vote. In the western city of Kisumu, around 2,000 demonstrators marched on the election board offices, witnesses said, heeding Raila Odinga s appeal for protests against Thursday s repeat presidential ballot, before dispersing peacefully. Odinga is boycotting the contest against incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta. He says it will not be free and fair as the election board had made insufficient progress towards reforms he demanded after the original election held in August was annulled. Odinga had urged his supporters to ensure the new vote did not take place, repeatedly saying there would be  no elections . But on Tuesday he told the BBC he was not calling for protests on election day itself.  We have not told people to protest on polling day. We have not said that at all. We have told people to stay away,  he said in a radio interview. When called for clarification, Odinga s spokesman said he was saying  peaceful protests  would still take place and that the opposition would fully explain their plans on Wednesday.  At least 49 people have died in political violence since the August ballot, evoking unwelcome memories of the aftermath of a disputed 2007 vote, when more than 1,200 people were killed.  On Tuesday evening, the bodyguard of the deputy chief justice was shot and wounded as he bought flowers by the side of the road, police said.  The motive for the shooting was unclear, but it is likely to add to the tense atmosphere surrounding the vote. Judges have received threats since they nullified the August result.  The political stand-off has blunted growth in East Africa s richest economy, a nation which values its stability and relative freedom in a region plagued by conflict.  Kenya s Supreme Court is still hearing several cases challenging the legality of Thursday s election.  One, brought by human rights activist Khelef Khalifa and two others, seeks to delay the vote on grounds that the election board is not sufficiently prepared. The Supreme Court, the only body that can now legally postpone the poll beyond the end of the month, will hear the case on Wednesday.  On Tuesday, the election board canceled a planned briefing with journalists on preparations for the polls.  Last week, the head of the election board said it was not clear a free and fair vote could take place due to intimidation and political interference. He spoke after the resignation of an election commissioner, who then fled the country and released a statement saying she had been threatened, although she did not say by whom.  A day before the Aug. 8 vote, another member of the election board was found tortured and murdered. On Monday, the International Crisis Group, a global think-tank, called for a delay in the election.  Proceeding under current conditions would deepen Kenya s ethnic cleavages and prolong a stalemate that has already claimed dozens of lives and come at a high economic cost,  it said.  Both the election board and the government have said the vote will go ahead, irrespective of whether Odinga contests it, and only a court ruling could legally delay the re-run ballot beyond the end of October.  On Tuesday, police fired teargas and bullets into the air to break up protesters in the capital Nairobi. In Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold, demonstrators said that the polls should not take place, but were unclear on how they should be stopped.   All we know is that there will be no elections. As to how this will be done, we are waiting for the big announcement by Baba (Odinga) tomorrow,  said one demonstrator, market trader James Ouma.  Around him, marchers waved branches and blew whistles. Last week Odinga supporters disrupted at least three official pre-polling events. Police said some election board staff were seriously injured.  Kenyatta won the first election on Aug. 8, by 1.4 million votes, but the Supreme Court annulled that outcome on Sept. 1 over procedural irregularities. Odinga s team then presented a list of demands to the election board.  Some have been met - opposition monitors will now have access to the board s computers as results come in, a key official has gone on an extended holiday, and numerical results vulnerable to typographical errors will not be transmitted, rather only scanned copies of paper forms from tallying centers.  The board said it was impossible to meet other demands - such as changing the technology provider - in the short time frame allotted for new elections.  Under Kenya s constitution, fresh elections must be held within 60 days of nullified ones.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Tanzania suspends fourth newspaper since June in media crackdown,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania s government on Tuesday suspended publication of an opposition-leaning newspaper for three months, the fourth newspaper to be shut down since June in what critics say is a crackdown on press freedom. The newspaper, Tanzania Daima, was shut down for publishing an article about the number of Tanzanians on life-prolonging anti-retroviral drugs used to treat AIDS, the director general of the Tanzania Information Services, Hassan Abbasi, said in a statement. The article was factually incorrect, Abbasi said. The move comes after President John Magufuli warned in January that the days of newspapers his government viewed as unethical  were numbered    a statement that triggered concern  about censorship. The government banned the critical  newspaper MwanaHalisi in September for two years after accusing it of inciting violence. Another independent newspaper, Mawio, was banned in June over articles linking two former presidents to alleged improprieties in mining deals signed in the 1990s and early 2000s. Magufuli has won some praise from western donors for an anti-corruption drive and cutting wasteful public spending. But opponents accuse him of increasingly undermining democracy by curbing dissent and stifling free speech. Magufuli has denied opposition accusations that his government was becoming increasingly autocratic. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Gunman injures bodyguard of Kenya's deputy chief justice,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - A gunman shot and wounded a bodyguard to Kenya s deputy chief justice on Tuesday, police said, adding to an increasingly tense atmosphere two days before the East African nation is due to hold a repeat presidential election.  Rashid Mohamed, the officer in charge of Dagoretti police station, told Reuters it was unclear why the bodyguard to Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu was shot or how many attackers there were. The bodyguard was shot in the shoulder and his gun was taken as he was buying pots of flowers by the side of the road, Mohamed said.  Last month, the chief justice said judges have received repeated threats since the Supreme Court nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta s win in the Aug. 8 polls and ordered a fresh election.

Iraq paramilitaries battle Kurds in push towards Turkish border oil hub,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi pro-government paramilitaries launched an offensive against Kurdish troops on Tuesday near the Turkish frontier, pushing towards a strategic border crossing and oil export pipeline hub that Baghdad says must come under its control. The Iraqi government has transformed the balance of power in the north of the country since launching a campaign last week to seize back territory from the Kurds, who govern an autonomous region of three northern provinces and had also seized a swathe of other territory in northern Iraq. The Kurds held a referendum on independence last month that Baghdad called illegal. Baghdad responded by seizing back the city of Kirkuk, the oil-producing areas around it, and other territory that the Kurds had captured from Islamic State. Prime Minister Haidar Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory, and has also demanded central control of Iraq s border crossings with Turkey, all of which are inside the Kurdish autonomous region itself. A Kurdish official said Kurdish security forces known as Peshmerga had successfully beaten back an advance by Iranian-backed pro-government paramilitaries in the region of Rabi a, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Fish-Khabur border area. Fish-Khabur is strategically vital because oil from both Kurdish and government-held parts of northern Iraq cross at a pipeline there into Turkey, the main route out of the area for international export, crucial for any Kurdish independence bid. Abadi told a news conference in Baghdad he will discuss the issue of the border crossing with his Turkish counterpart Benali Yildirim on Wednesday in Ankara. The fighting so far has taken place outside the Kurdish autonomous region, but Fish-Khabur is located within it, so any assault on the border crossing would mark a major escalation, bringing government troops into undisputed Kurdish territory.  Crude oil flowing through the Iraqi Kurdistan pipeline to Turkey s port of Ceyhan were up slightly at 300,000 barrels per day on Tuesday, about half the level before the Iraqi takeover of Kirkuk, a shipping source in London said. The pumping rate has risen by about 50,000 bpd since Monday. An Iraqi military spokesman denied there had been any clashes in the area. But an Iraqi security source in Baghdad and a rights activist in northwest Iraq said the confrontation had started at dawn and was still going on by midday.  Peshmerga repelled the attack and pushed Popular Mobilisation back in to Rabi a,  tweeted KRG President Masoud Barzani s media advisor, Hemin Hawrami.  A military spokesman in Baghdad said in response:  There are no clashes.  The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is close allies of both sides, arming and training both the Kurds and the central government s army to fight against Islamic State.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Baghdad this week, but Abadi rebuffed his call for Iraq to reject the role of Iran-backed Shi ite paramilitaries that fight alongside government troops and have taken a hard line on the Kurds. An Iraqi government security advisor said on Monday Baghdad aimed to bring the three-way border crossing with Turkey and Syria at Fish-Khabur under its control, but he declined to say if a military move was being prepared. The Iraqi government s advance over the past week has been achieved with comparatively little violence, with Kurds mostly withdrawing without a fight. Nevertheless, Amnesty International reported that at least 11 civilians were killed and tens of thousands displaced from Kurdish areas of Tuz Khurmato, a town south of Kirkuk. It said images, videos, photos and dozens of testimonies indicated that hundreds of properties had been looted in a rampage targeting Kurdish parts of the ethnically mixed town. Elections for the presidency and parliament of Iraq s Kurdistan region set for Nov. 1 have been delayed by eight months, the regional parliament announced on Tuesday. The electoral commission said on Monday that parties had failed to present candidates amid turmoil in the region following the Sept. 25 independence referendum. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Kenya officials change way of announcing election results,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Official results from Kenya s repeat presidential election on Thursday are likely to take several days to collate, election officials told Reuters, due to changes in the process to try to make it more transparent. The Supreme Court on Sept. 1 ordered a repeat of the election after judges annulled the results of an Aug. 8 poll, pitting incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta against opposition leader Raila Odinga, due to procedural irregularities. Official results said Kenyatta won on Aug. 8 by 1.4 million votes, but Odinga said the vote was rigged. Odinga has refused to participate in Thursday s rerun because he said election officials have not carried out sufficient reforms. Judges criticized the election board for rushing to announce the official results based only on numbers sent from the polling stations, without having the tally forms from all 40,883 polling stations showing the results. The paper forms are a back-up system meant to help prevent rigging. The board has up to a week to announce official results. This time, polling stations will only transmit scanned images of tally forms from polling stations, not numerical results, Andrew Limo, spokesman for the election commission, said on Tuesday. The scanned images will be posted online. The election board will collate and publish results by constituency once all polling stations there have reported. This could take several days in rural constituencies with poor phone networks and far-flung polling stations. There are 290 constituencies. Without Odinga running, Kenyatta is the firm favorite to win. The other six candidates failed to poll more than 1 percent in the August polls; one has since been disqualified for bankruptcy. Odinga has urged supporters to boycott the ballot and opposition leaders have called for protests on the day of the elections.  The key thing to watch in this election will be turnout,  said Murithi Mutiga, a senior regional analyst for the International Crisis Group, a global thinktank.   This will really be a referendum on the legitimacy of Kenyatta s second term.   Just over 79 percent of Kenya s 19.6 million registered voters cast a ballot in the last poll.

Catalan secessionists mull snap election as Madrid hangs tough,"MADRID (Reuters) - Secessionist leaders in Catalonia may call a snap election in an attempt to break the deadlock with Madrid over independence, a senior local politician said on Tuesday, but Spanish authorities made clear that would not be enough. Spain says it will impose direct rule on Catalonia from Friday to prevent an illegal push for independence, invoking unprecedented powers to dismiss the regional government. Madrid said an election would not change those plans. The Catalan parliament meets on Thursday to agree on a response to Madrid, and many analysts believe the economically powerful region could formally declare independence.  Secessionists in Catalonia say their independence referendum on Oct. 1 - which attracted a 43 percent turnout and was mostly boycotted by those Catalans who want to remain in Spain - has given them a mandate for statehood. Catalonia said on Monday it was confident that its officials, including the police, would defy attempts by Madrid to enforce direct rule. Spanish political and business leaders, along with most Catalonian newspapers, have urged Catalan President Carles Puigdemont to call a regional election before he is stripped of his authority. They say direct rule from Madrid would be a humiliation for Catalonia and pose a serious risk of unrest. Puigdemont has so far remained silent on the matter of an election but an ally of his pro-independence government said he was actively considering this option.  We have evidence this is currently on the table,  Carles Riera, a Catalan lawmaker for the anti-capitalist CUP party, told a news conference. Calling an election would be a face-saving move for Puigdemont as it could either strengthen his mandate if pro-independence parties won or allow him a graceful exit if they did not. The Spanish government said a snap election would be a first step but Puigdemont would also have to withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence he made earlier this month. The government had moved to cancel Catalonia s autonomous status because it believed there had been a  serious failure  by Puigdemont to meet his obligations, Justice Minister Rafael Catala said in a radio interview.  Everything is not fixed just by calling an election.  Catala said that if Puigdemont appeared before the Spanish Senate, it would help to resolve the crisis. A top official in the Senate said that if Puigdemont decided to appear before the house, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would likely come to the chamber as well so that a proper debate could be organised between the two. The Senate said on Tuesday it had invited Puigdemont to appear before the chamber on Thursday at 5 p.m (1500 GMT) or Friday at 10 a.m (0800 GMT). The Madrid government has so far refused to meet the Catalan leader until he drops his call for independence and Catala said any appearance by Puigdemont had to be within a legal and constitutional framework.   If his appearance is within the constitution and the law we ll be delighted ... But if it s just to ratify his position on Catalonia s independence, sadly we will not be able to do anything else than continuing with the measures already set by the government,  Catala said. The political uncertainty has taken its toll on Spain s wealthiest region, with hundreds of companies moving their headquarters out of Catalonia. Volkswagen s Spanish unit SEAT, one of the biggest employers in the region, said it would move its registered office if it felt there was no longer legal security in Catalonia, although it had so far not made a decision.  Relocating the registered office would respond to the need to seek legal protection, and would make sense the moment we felt it was no longer afforded in the territory where we are located,  SEAT Executive Committee Chairman Luca de Meo said in a letter to the company s more than 14,000 employees in the region.

"French Catalans offer Puigdemont luxury safe-house, just in case","PARIS (Reuters) - French Catalans have a villa with a swimming pool and other safe houses ready in the event that Carles Puigdemont and other leaders of Spain s Catalonia region have to seek refuge from Madrid. While the idea of Catalan leaders fleeing Spain and setting up an underground network abroad still appears remote, French backers of Catalan independence are taking no chances. They say they have 52 houses and flats lined up near the Spanish border.  It s all ready. We have the logistics to be able to house about 200 people for now, and more if needed,  said Robert Casanovas, an activist and head of the Committee for the self-determination of North Catalonia   the French Catalan area.  Our aim is to be ready if there are arrest warrants issued against members of the Catalan government, and in particular its president,  he said in a phone interview. The Spanish government is threatening to impose direct rule on Catalonia, a region with its own language and culture, which held a referendum on independence on Oct. 1 that Spanish courts declared illegal. Thousands of Catalan speakers live across the border in France, mainly in the eastern Pyrenees region along the Mediterranean Coast, territory ceded to France by Spain in the 17th Century. Top Catalan officials sought refuge in France in the late 1930s from Spain s military dictator Francisco Franco. Catalan leader Puigdemont and his government have called for civil disobedience to defy the direct rule move. They have not publicly discussed exile.     Casanovas said his group had decided unilaterally to offer the safe-houses. He declined to say whether there had been an answer, saying it was too sensitive. Unlike their Spanish counterparts, French Catalan activists do not seek independence for their territory but ask for more autonomy, including on tax matters. Casanovas said his 30-strong committee leads a 300-strong French Catalan group. Around 400,000 people live in the area of France that activists call North Catalonia. Casanovas said among the safe-houses on offer was his own home in Theza, a short drive from the Spanish border.  It s a pretty nice house with a swimming pool, it s quite big, with a 7,000-square-metre garden, so it would work out really well,  he said.  We couldn t put him in a two-bedroom... We need something worthy of a head of government.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

Germany's Schaeuble elected Bundestag speaker to tackle far right,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was elected speaker of Germany s lower house of parliament on Tuesday, tasked with keeping order in a body where decades of conciliatory conventions are under threat from the arrival of the far right. In an inaugural Bundestag session following the Sept. 24 federal election, lawmakers from the other parties showed their disdain for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party by overwhelmingly rejecting its candidate for deputy speaker. Convention holds that each party represented in the Bundestag names a deputy speaker. But lawmakers spurned AfD candidate Albert Glaser in three rounds of voting. Still, the AfD, which has become the first far-right group represented in Germany s parliament for more than half a century, made clear its intention to shake up German politics on the national stage.  The people have decided, now a new era begins,  AfD parliamentary leader Bernd Baumann told the chamber.  Schaeuble, who won 501 of 705 votes for the post of speaker, shot back in his maiden speech:  Nobody on their own represents the people.  Germany s longest serving lawmaker, 75-year-old Schaeuble is one of the country s most respected politicians and seen as well qualified to tame recalcitrant lawmakers. By agreeing to move to the Bundestag, Schaeuble has opened the way for the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) to take over his powerful Finance Ministry, helping to unblock talks on an expected new three-way coalition with the Greens. The conservatives, FDP and Greens convene on Tuesday evening for coalition talks. FDP leader Christian Lindner told broadcaster n-tv that Schaeuble was an extraordinary figure in German politics:  He has gravitas, a clear position and a natural authority that will be good to have in a parliament that has just become more diverse, and where some manners may be called into question.  The AfD s Baumann shocked other lawmakers by suggesting that they had used Nazi-era tactics to prevent Glaser from taking a deputy speaker post. FDP politician Marco Buschmann said the comments were  beyond tasteless.  The AfD can nominate an alternative candidate for deputy speaker. Although there is precedent for a party s first choice being rejected, there is no precedent for a party failing to have any lawmaker accepted in the post.

"Turkish, U.S. businesses call for resolution of diplomatic rows","ANKARA (Reuters) - Leading Turkish and U.S. businesses urged the governments of Turkey and the United States on Tuesday to resolve a series of diplomatic rows that have prompted both countries to cut back on issuing visas to each other s citizens. Turkey has fumed over what it sees as U.S. reluctance to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of  orchestrating an abortive military coup last year, and over U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, seen by Turks as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).  Gulen denies any connection with the coup bid. The Turkish-U.S. Business Council (TAIK) called on the U.S. and Turkish governments to engage in talks to resolve the rows and prevent harm to both of their economies and citizens.  We call on the governments of Turkey and America to enter into discussions to reach a meaningful resolution to the existing differences   so that neither of our peoples or economies suffer,  TAIK said in a statement.  Relations sank to a new low with the arrest of a second U.S. consular worker earlier this month over alleged links to last year s coup attempt.  The statement by TAIK, a council comprised of leading Turkish and U.S. corporations such as Ford, Microsoft, and Turkish Airlines, was the latest in a series of appeals to the NATO allies to settle their differences. But President Tayyip Erdogan has not retreated from the row, castigating Washington over democracy issues in comments that may further dim hopes of a resolution. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
"UK sees swift deal on Brexit transition outline, still at odds with EU on trade","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain believes it can quickly agree a framework for a transitional agreement on exiting the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May s spokesman said on Tuesday, even as other stark differences over the Brexit timeline persisted. Britain is seeking a so-called implementation period of around two years following its departure from the EU in March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place. Businesses are keen to see the details of such a deal as soon as possible to end uncertainty over the trading rules they will face after Britain leaves the bloc.  In terms of the broad outline of an implementation period, we believe that we can agree that quickly,  May s spokesman said. He did not provide further detail on when Britain hoped to reach such an agreement.  We re clear that we want to achieve this implementation period, that we believe we can do so, and that our priority is to provide certainty for business,  he said. May left some businesses confused on Monday by saying any implementation period would not be agreed until a deal was struck on Britain s future trading relationship with the bloc. That countered expectations that a transitional deal would come well before any deal on trade. It also highlighted a clear difference between Britain and the EU over when a trade deal would be agreed. Britain is seeking an  ambitious  deal on trade with the EU to replace its existing arrangement at the end of an implementation period. It believes its current close ties with the bloc mean such a deal will be agreed by October 2018. But the EU s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it would take three years to negotiate a trade deal, meaning that if talks start in December it would be ready in time for the end of a transition period running until December 2020. In response, asked if it was Britain s position that it could still achieve a trade deal by the end of next year under the two-year exit process, May s spokesman said:  Yes . Commenting on the timeline set out by Britain, an EU official said the bloc wanted to  define a framework for our future relationship  by this time next year so that a withdrawal treaty could  take account  of that future under the terms of the  Article 50  legal exit process. However, the official said the EU will only negotiate on the details of a free trade deal after Britain has actually left in March 2019 because the EU s own laws do not allow it to negotiate trade agreements with its own members.  Article 50 says that the withdrawal agreement has to take into account our future relationship, so we will know the terms of our partnership with the EU by our exit,  a spokeswoman for May said when asked about the position set out by the EU official.  But as to the details, that s subject to negotiation and I can t pre-empt those.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Barnier says only off-the-peg deals open to Britain post-Brexit,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Britain must choose from a range of existing off-the-peg models for its relationship to the European Union when it leaves the bloc, Brussels  chief negotiator Michel Barnier has told a group of newspapers. Barnier, who is leading the EU s negotiations with Britain after last year s Brexit vote, told Handelsblatt that while it was in both sides  interest to maintain a close relationship, the range of possible relationships was limited.  The only way to do it without difficulties is by staying within the internal market. That would be the Norway model, but the British government rejects it,  he said.  Another option would be a free trade agreement like the CETA-deal with Canada.  Even a Canada-style deal would take several years to negotiate. Asked if there would be a specific British model after the country left on March 30, 2019, Barnier said:  No.  European leaders decided this weekend that Britain had not made enough progress on exit negotiations to begin work on devising a future relationship, leading to concern in Europe and the world that Britain could crash out of the bloc in disorderly fashion, with serious economic and political consequences.  A disorderly exit would bring enormous problems - mainly for Britain, but also for us,  he said in the interview with Handelsblatt and four further European newspapers. That would affect everything from food supply to healthcare. He added:  Britain would leave the single air traffic space, losing take-off and landing rights. It would no longer be a member of the Euratom treaty and could no longer import nuclear material from the EU for hospitals and power stations.  The process of designing a longer-term relationship with the EU was also fraught with difficulties, he added, warning that the EU would need to find ways to head off any British attempts to undercut European environmental or welfare standards.  We will have to arrange future co-operation on defense and security policy in a separate treaty,  he said.  We will have to ward off British attempts to influence our decision-making processes in this area.

Malawi vigilante arrests rise to 200 in vampire scare,"LILONGWE (Reuters) - Police in Malawi have arrested 200 suspected members of vigilante mobs that have been killing people they believe are vampires, a spokesman said on Tuesday. Nine people have been killed since mid-September in southern Malawi where there is a widespread belief in witchcraft. The violence has prompted the United Nations and the U.S. embassy to declare some parts of the country no-go zones. The attacks spread last week to Blantyre, Malawi s second largest city where a 22-year-old man was stoned then burned to death and another was stoned to death.  Both were accused of bloodsucking, although medical experts deny the existence of vampirism in Malawi. Amos Daka, head of the Medical Society of Malawi, said his group was not aware  that any one has adequate clinical evidence to support any of the many claims to date.  President Peter Mutharika has visited parts of the country affected by the violence. This month, the United Nations pulled staff out of two areas in southern Malawi.

Ireland welcomes home student who spent four years in an Egyptian jail,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish student Ibrahim Halawa was greeted by cheering crowds at Dublin Airport on Tuesday as he arrived home following his acquittal last month in a four-year mass trial. Halawa, who was born and raised in Dublin and is a son of the most senior Muslim cleric in Ireland, was 17 when he was arrested along with hundreds of others in 2013 as part of a crackdown on protests in Egypt.  It still feels like a dream, it s a moment I ve waited for four years. I m a free man. I m hoping I can get my life back, get back to college and get my career,  a smiling Halawa, draped in an Irish flag, told reporters upon his arrival home. Halawa thanked the Irish people, the government and his family for working hard to secure his release. A member of the Irish government, which had lobbied for his return, was among the well-wishers. Halawa and three of his sisters were charged along with nearly 500 others with crimes including breaking into a mosque, killing 44 people, and illegal possession of firearms in violence that followed the military s overthrow of Egypt s Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, in 2013. The Halawas said they were on vacation visiting extended family in Egypt and joined a protest against the military s ouster of Mursi while they were there.  The defendants had all faced the death penalty and though none received it, hundreds were given hefty jail sentences. Halawa s sisters were released shortly after their arrests.  This case has been one of the most complex, sensitive and difficult consular cases to which the Irish Government has ever responded. I and all of my colleagues are very pleased Ibrahim s ordeal is now at an end,  Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said in a statement. Halawa has said he was regularly tortured during his period in detention. The Egyptian authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of abuses from rights groups.  They all claim that (torture) and we have often denied (it took place),  a senior Egyptian interior ministry source said.  In the end, there is the prosecution and the court, they are decisive. Anyone who experiences assault in jail must report it to the prosecution or the court...and the prisons are all subjected to inspections.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Incoming New Zealand government to review central bank objectives,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s new government plans to review and reform the Central Bank Act to possibly include employment, alongside inflation, as a dual target, Labour Prime Minister-elect Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday. The populist New Zealand First, the junior partner in the new Labour-led coalition government, also wants to broaden the central bank s focus to include greater management of the local dollar s value against other currencies.  We have been looking at changing the objectives set out in the Reserve Bank Act,  Ardern told reporters in Wellington.  The objectives of the Act to possibly include employment is certainly part of our plans.  Labour flagged the monetary policy changes during its election campaign. New Zealand First has previously mentioned it would like the central bank to better manage the currency, without elaborating.  The New Zealand dollar suffered fresh falls on Tuesday as Ardern and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters confirmed their policy priorities. The kiwi dollar shed all its early gains to push below $0.6940, having briefly been as high as $0.7003 at one point. Rather than just focussing on inflation, Labour wants the Reserve Bank to have a full employment goal when devising policy settings, bringing it into line with the United States and Australia.  While unemployment in New Zealand is at near decade lows of below 5 percent, job growth was a hot political issue during the recent election. The unlikely alliance between the centre-left Labour and populist New Zealand First was brokered after a Sept. 23 election failed to deliver a majority to the governing National or opposition Labour.  Peters has been offered the role of deputy prime minister, which he is likely to accept, and Ardern indicated on Tuesday that Peters would also become foreign minister, putting a protectionist at the forefront of New Zealand s international relations. Peters was foreign minister in a Labour-led government in 2005, during which time he became among a handful of Western politicians to visit North Korea.   The general consensus is that he did a good job,  said Richard Shaw, politics professor at Massey University.  He wasn t particularly interested in restructuring departments. He s very good at working the room and is an affable character.  Labour and New Zealand First share similar policies designed to cut immigration, ban foreigners from buying existing property and raise the minimum wage. Many of the policies draw on voter concerns that immigration and foreign buyers of local homes are putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices, representing a shift in New Zealand s formerly open door policy.  Ardern said Labour s immigration policy remained in place, whereby net migration would reduce from by between 20,000 to 30,000. This represents a less dramatic cut than New Zealand First had proposed prior to the election. Net migration is running at just over 70,000 a year. While a  confidence and supply  agreement with the Greens is delivering policies across the political spectrum, such as a push to legalise cannabis for personal use. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1

France to discuss possible new Rafale sale with Egypt's al-Sisi: Le Maire,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will discuss the possible sale of more Rafale aircrafts with Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi during his visit to Paris this week, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Europe 1 radio on Tuesday. Under the previous government, France had concluded several major military agreements with Egypt, including the sale of 24 Rafale combat aircraft, a multi-mission frigate and two Mistral warships in contracts worth some 6 billion euros. The 2015 Rafale contract - the first export contract for the jet - included the option of selling another twelve aircrafts.  If there can be new contracts, so much the better. That will be discussed today by the President of the Republic (Macron) and the president (Sisi),  said Le Maire, when asked by Europe 1 radio to comment on reports that the sale of the extra 12 aircrafts was on the table but that his ministry was reluctant because of the payment terms asked for by Egypt.  It is normal that Bercy (the French finance ministry) would want to make sure Egypt should be able to pay its plane orders,  Le Maire said. Sisi is in Paris until Oct 25.  As far as human rights are concerned, of course we ll discuss that. I have no doubt that the President of the Republic will mention the issue of human rights when he has lunch with his Egyptian counterpart,  added Le Maire. Rafale-maker Dassault Aviation declined to comment.  France and Egypt have nurtured closer economic and military ties in recent years, and with Sisi s rise to power that relationship has improved with both sides concerned by the political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt. But human rights organisations at home and overseas have accused France under Macron of remaining silent in the face of increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi s government, as the 2018 presidential elections approach.

"Myanmar, Bangladesh agree to cooperate on Rohingya refugee repatriation","NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar and Bangladesh on Tuesday agreed to cooperate on the repatriation of Rohingya refugees and took steps to boost border security as relations between the neighbors have been strained by the continuing flow of refugees into Bangladesh. Over 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response by the Myanmar army that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing. At a meeting in Myanmar s capital Naypyitaw, attended by Myanmar s home affairs minister lieutenant general Kyaw Swe and his Bangladeshi counterpart Asaduzzaman Khan, the countries signed two agreements covering security and border cooperation. The two sides have also agreed to  to halt the outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh,  and  to form a joint working group,  Tin Myint, permanent secretary from Myanmar s home affairs ministry told reporters after the meetings.  After joint working group, the verification, (the) two countries have agreed to arrange different steps so that these people can return to their homeland safely and honourably and in secure conditions,  said Mostafa Kamal Uddin, secretary from Bangladeshi home affairs ministry. The officials did not elaborate on the specific steps the authorities would take for the repatriation, adding that the bulk of discussions was dedicated to border and security cooperation agreements which have been long in the making. Tin Myint said the two countries agreed  to restore normalcy in Rakhine to enable displaced Myanmar residents to return from Bangladesh at the earliest opportunity.  He also said Myanmar had sent a list of suspects who had fled to Bangladesh and requested the authorities there to investigate and return them to Myanmar. Thousands of refugees have continued to arrived cross the Naf river separating Myanmar s western Rakhine state and Bangladesh in recent days, even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5. The United States said on Monday it was considering a range of further actions over Myanmar s treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority. While on Tuesday the officials said the talks were friendly, tensions are still high between the two countries. Bangladesh last month accused Myanmar of repeatedly violating its air space and warned that any more  provocative acts  could have  unwarranted consequences .  On border and security, the two sides decided to establish border liaison offices, carry out regular meetings between two security forces, jointly combat drug trafficking across the border and set up a mechanism to communicate directly. Bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are seen as illegal migrants. It was already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya before the latest crisis. Though Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are denied citizenship and access to basic civil rights such as freedom of movement, decent education and healthcare. Hundreds in Rakhine on Sunday protested to urge Myanmar s government not to repatriate the Rohingya. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Turkey says doesn't want Greece to become 'safe haven' for coup plotters,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu urged Greece on Tuesday to not become a  safe haven  for plotters of last year s coup attempt, citing the 995 people who have applied for asylum since the failed putsch. Speaking at a joint news conference with his Greek counterpart, Nikos Kotzias, Cavusoglu said asylum seekers needed to be evaluated to determine those linked to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Turkey for masterminding the putsch.  We would not want our neighbor Greece, with whom we are improving our ties, to be a safe haven for Gulenists. We believe these applications will be evaluated meticulously and that traitors will not be given credit,  Cavusoglu said. Responding to Cavusoglu s comments, Kotzias said the decisions on asylum seekers were made by the Greek judiciary and had to be respected even if  it doesn t please some . Relations between Turkey and Greece were further strained in May after a Greek court ruled to not extradite eight Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece following last year s coup attempt. Turkey alleges the men, who fled to Greece in a military helicopter as the July coup unfolded, were involved in efforts to overthrow President Tayyip Erdogan and has repeatedly demanded they be sent back. Greek courts have blocked two extradition requests by Ankara, drawing an angry rebuke from Turkey and highlighting the tense relations between the NATO allies, who remain at odds over issues from territorial disputes to ethnically split Cyprus.  Unfortunately, the Greek courts did not extradite (the eight soldiers), and this has greatly disappointed us,  Cavusoglu said. He said two other soldiers, accused of trying to assassinate Erdogan on the night of the coup, had also fled to Greece, and that Turkey had demanded their extradition. In the aftermath of the coup, some 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and more than 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors. Rights groups and Turkey s Western allies have said President Tayyip Erdogan is using the failed coup as a pretext to crush dissent, but the government says the measures are necessary to fight the threats it is facing.

Dutchman put on trial for Ethiopian war crimes in 1970s,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A Dutch citizen will go on trial in the Netherlands next Monday on charges he committed war crimes in Ethiopia in the 1970s. The 63-year-old Dutchman, who was born in Ethiopia, is accused of the incarceration, torture and murder of opponents of former Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in the late  70s.  As Mengistu s representative in the Ethiopian province of Gojjam, the man is accused of ordering the killing of 75 young prisoners in 1978 and of being responsible for the incarceration and inhumane treatment of more than 200 people. An Ethiopian court has sentenced the man to death, in absentia, for his role in what was called the  red terror , which the communist military junta of Mengistu conducted after the ouster of the Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie, in 1974. The Ethiopian sentence can t be carried out in the Netherlands, making a new trial the best option to hold the man to account, the Dutch national prosecutor s office said on Tuesday. The trial in The Hague is based on an investigation by the International Crimes Team of the Dutch national police. It contains the statements of several Ethiopian witnesses, some of whom will be present at the trial, the prosecutor s office said.  The accused has been held in provisional custody in the Netherlands since 2015.   Mengistu was found guilty in absentia of genocide in 2007, after he and top members of his military government were accused of killing thousands during his 17-year rule. Mengistu was ousted in 1991 and fled to Zimbabwe, where he still lives. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

Liberia's ruling party alleges election irregularities,"MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia s ruling party, which came second in a presidential election first round on Oct. 10, has said the poll was marred by irregularities, following similar claims from other parties. Vice President Joseph Boakai, a member of outgoing President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf s Unity Party, won 28.8 percent of votes, versus 38.4 percent for former soccer star George Weah. A run-off vote between the two candidates is scheduled for Nov. 7.  International observers from the European Union, the Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute have said they saw no major problems with the vote, which was meant to usher in Liberia s first democratic transfer of power since 1944.   The Unity Party did not say whether it would petition the election committee for a re-run, as did the Liberty Party of the third-placed candidate, Charles Brumskine, over what it said were  gross irregularities and fraud .  We too have been gathering reports ... pointing to some anomalies and electoral management inefficiencies, which prevented some of our supporters and citizens from exercising their constitutional rights to vote,  the Unity Party said in a statement. It said it was still deciding what action to take  consistent with the laws of Liberia . Another candidate, Alexander Cummings of the Alternative National Congress, has also said there were problems during the polls, including the theft of ballot boxes, but his party has yet to file a complaint.  The communications director of the election commission, Henry Flomo, said the commission would respond to the Unity Party s concerns as quickly as possibly, adding that the party could challenge the commission s findings at the Supreme Court if it is not satisfied.

Suicide risk torture victim can be deported: EU court adviser,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European governments can refuse asylum to traumatized torture victims and deport them   even if a lack of healthcare in their home country means they may well kill themselves on return, a top EU court adviser said on Tuesday. An advocate general of the European Court of Justice gave the opinion in the case of a former Tamil rebel who was refused asylum in Britain and appealed on the grounds that he would not get treatment in his native Sri Lanka for mental stress caused by his previous torture by government forces. Yves Bot advised ECJ judges who will rule on the case later that the man, identified only as  MP , no longer risked torture in Sri Lanka. The LTTE rebels were defeated in 2009. ECJ judges typically follow the advice of the advocate general, although they are not bound to do so.  MP may not claim subsidiary protection ... even if it is unlikely that he could receive the necessary treatment to manage the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffers from, owing to shortcomings in the health system, and is likely to commit suicide if he is returned to his country of origin,  Bot said. Britain s Supreme Court had sought the ECJ s guidance. Bot said the British judges could still choose to rule that the man was entitled to protection as a  very exceptional case , but said MP did not appear to fit that category. Bot stressed that a broader reading of the relevant law, giving asylum to all those who had suffered persecution in the past, would  considerably increase the obligations  of EU member states and would go beyond the intentions of lawmakers. The European Union has faced deep political crisis in the past few years over large numbers of people seeking asylum; more than a million arrived in 2015. That has fuelled nationalist opposition to the EU as an institution and raised tensions among the member states, which have tightened controls on immigration. Immigration, and the power of the ECJ to overrule British law, were both among the reasons cited by campaigners when Britain voted to leave the bloc. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
U.S. officials will not label treatment of Rohingya as 'ethnic cleansing',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government officials declined on Tuesday to characterize the treatment of Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims as ethnic cleansing, but listed new measures including targeted sanctions Washington is considering to address the crisis.  I m not in a position ... to characterize it today, but to me this very closely resembles some of the worst kind of atrocities that I ve seen during a long career,  Mark Storella Deputy Assistant Secretary of State from the Bureau Of Population, Refugees and Migration said at a Senate hearing, when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar s Rakhine state since security forces responded to Rohingya militants  attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar, also known as Burma, rejects that accusation, insisting action was needed to combat  terrorists  who killed civilians. But it has left the world community counting the cost as international organizations and the government of Bangladesh, which has taken in the vast majority of the refugees, race to provide food, water and medical care. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for a strong U.S. response to the crisis and criticized government leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in Washington, for failing to do more.  She s an impressive person, but she s not taking on the challenge,  said Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin said he considered the treatment of the Rohingya genocide. The State Department said on Monday that Washington is taking steps and considering a range of further actions over Myanmar s treatment of the Rohingya, including targeted sanctions under its Global Magnitsky law. [L2N1MZ01T] At the foreign relations committee hearing, Patrick Murphy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian And Pacific Affairs, said broader sanctions were also being considered, but cautioned that doing so could lessen the U.S. government s ability to influence the Myanmar government to change.

Namibia dismisses U.N. expert's claims on North Korea ties,"WINDHOEK (Reuters) - Namibia s government on Tuesday rejected accusations by the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea who accused the southern African nation of not complying with UN Security Council sanctions against Pyongyang.  Namibia said that it rejected allegations that it had not submitted a report for more than a year to the Security Council s sanctions committee on North Korea.  The Government of Namibia wishes to categorically state that it has submitted reports to the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee as required, the last having been submitted on 8 April 2017,  Lineekela Mboti, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation, said in a statement.  Hugh Griffiths, who is the coordinator of the body charged with monitoring sanctions enforcement on North Korea, said Namibia had contracted North Korean workers and state companies to construct an ammunitions factory in clear violation of UN sanctions dating back nearly a decade.  Griffiths alleged in a report on CNN that the UN panel had not received responses from Namibia to specific queries for more than a year.  It is not enough to talk in the media. It is not enough to say you have been exonerated by the UN for North Korean sanctions violations because that is not true,  Griffiths was quoted by CNN as saying. Mboti said Namibia terminated the contracts with Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation and Mansudae Overseas Projects in the southern African nation,  which will remain in place  for as long as the UN Security Council sanctions continued. She said Windhoek was committed to complying with all relevant UN resolutions on North Korea, and had invited the UN experts to visit Namibia to see for themselves. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Saudi foreign minister says backs Trump's stance on Iran,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia supports U.S. President Donald Trump s stance on Iran after he decided not to certify that Tehran is complying with a nuclear accord, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump broke ranks with other major powers this month by refusing to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the deal, even though international inspectors say it is.     Jubeir said the nuclear deal had shortcomings, and that he agreed with Trump s assessment that Iran was working to destabilise the region and was funding militant organisations.  Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, has been at loggerheads with Iran, a Shi ite Muslim country, for decades, and the countries have fought a long-running proxy war in the Middle East.  (Iran s behaviour) is not acceptable, and there will be consequences to the Iranians. This is what President Trump has said, and we are very supportive of that,  Jubeir said at a conference in London.          Following Trump s decision, U.S. Congress has until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact. Jubeir said that new sanctions on Iran would be welcome, and that a delay could mean that by the time sanctions had impact, Iran could have already developed  a dozen  nuclear bombs.   The international community needs to support those (sanctions) in order to send a very strong message to Iran that your behaviour, your nefarious activities, have consequences,  Jubeir said. Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Protests called after Porto court agrees woman's adultery was factor in attack,"LISBON (Reuters) - A women s rights group has called a rally to protest against a Portuguese court ruling that upheld a light sentence for a woman s attackers on the grounds they may have been driven to it by her adultery, an offence punishable with death in the Bible.  Judges Neto de Moura and Maria Luisa Arantes rejected the prosecutors  appeal to toughen the suspended sentence and fine, saying the  depressive state  of the two defendants - the woman s former husband and her former lover - was a mitigating factor.     We read in the Bible that an adulteress should be punished with death,  the judges in the Porto Court of Appeal wrote. They also referenced the  symbolic sentences  given to men who murdered adulterous wives in the late 19th century in Portugal.  These references are merely intended to stress that the society has always strongly condemned adultery by a woman and therefore sees the violence by a betrayed, humiliated man with some understanding,  they wrote in their Oct. 11 verdict. The UMAR Women s Union for Alternative and Response called the verdict in Portugal s second-largest city  revolting  and said it perpetuated  the ideology of victim-blaming .   Evoking the Bible does not combine with the rule of law in our country and discredits the judicial norms,  UMAR said in a statement. In the 2015 attack, one of the men assaulted and held the victim while the other attacked her with a nail-spiked club. Her injuries were not life-threatening. Both were convicted and sentenced to pay large fines in addition to suspended time in prison of about a year each. UMAR and the feminist movement Por Todas Nos (For all of Us Women) called a protest rally in downtown Lisbon for Friday.

"Mugabe would have rejected WHO role, says spokesman after its U-turn","HARARE (Reuters) - Robert Mugabe would have rejected the role of World Health Organization goodwill envoy had he been formally asked, his spokesman said on Tuesday, days after state media cheered the Zimbabwean president s appointment. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus named Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador on Wednesday at a conference in Uruguay that both men were attending.  But the appointment was rescinded on Sunday following a backlash from Western donors, rights groups and opposition parties. Last Friday, the state-owned Herald celebrated the largely ceremonial appointment as a  New feather in President s cap , adding that Mugabe, 93, had accepted the role. His spokesman told the same newspaper on Tuesday that Zimbabwe s sole leader since independence from Britain in 1980 had only heard about the appointment via the media.  Had anything been put to the president ... (he) would have found such a request to be an awkward one,  Charamba was quoted as saying, citing Zimbabwe s role as a tobacco producer.  The WHO cannot take back what it never gave in the first place, and as far as he is concerned, all this hullabaloo over a non-appointment is in fact a non-event.  Charamba did not respond to calls seeking further comment. Mugabe s critics were outraged by Tedros  announcement, saying he was rewarding a man whose government had presided over the collapse of Zimbabwe s health system. In Geneva, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a U.N. briefing that there were  no fixed guidelines  for appointing a WHO goodwill ambassador, but that the director-general or his deputies had the power to select them.  On Tedros  decision to rescind Mugabe s appointment, he said:  I think in terms of transparency we were pretty good. A, it was tweeted and B it appeared on the website with the statements immediately.  Charamba said the fact that Zimbabwe was a producer and exporter of tobacco, mostly to China, would have meant Mugabe campaigning against a crop that underpins the economy. Tobacco is Zimbabwe s single largest foreign currency earner, bringing in an average $800 million annually in the last four years, according to official data.  To be seen to be playing goodwill ambassador in respect of an agency which has a well-defined stance on tobacco growing and tobacco selling, that would have been a contradiction,  Charamba said.  In other words, he was not going to oblige the invitation had it come his way anyway.  A Western diplomat in Geneva told Reuters:  It was a mistake, apparently there were no preparations or consultations.   It seems the idea was cooked up in a small group in Uruguay. He acted quickly to rescind it, some would have waited.  But it will be interesting to see what the damage is,  the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Australia expands security assistance to Philippines to combat Islamist militants,"CLARK FREEPORT ZONE, Philippines (Reuters) - Australia on Tuesday announced the expansion of its security support to the Philippines, which will involve training in urban counter-terrorism, to fight the rise and spread of Islamist militancy in the region. The announcement follows the end of the 154-day battle for Marawi city which stunned the Philippine s military inexperienced in urban combat, and fueled concerns Islamic State loyalists wanted to use the southern island of Mindanao as a base for Southeast Asia activity. The battle for Marawi ended on Monday. Philippines authorities said 920 militants, 165 troops and police and at least 45 civilians were killed in the conflict, which displaced more than 300,000 people. Australia, along with the United States, Singapore and China, provided weaponry and technical support, including surveillance aircraft.  All nations must learn from the recent Marawi conflict and the Philippines  experience,  said Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne, adding Canberra and Manila will host a post-conflict seminar to learn from the five-month Marawi conflict. About 80 soldiers from Australia s mobile training team will be deployed in local bases in the Philippines to train army and marine units in urban counter-terrorism warfare, said Payne on the sidelines of an ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting in Clark, a former U.S. air force base.  The practical training the Australian Defence Forces (ADF) will provide will ensure the Philippines defense force is better able to counter the brutal tactics being employed by terrorists,  Payne told a news conference.  The spread of Daesh-inspired (Islamic State) terrorism is a direct threat to Australia and its interests and we are committed to working with our partners and allies to ensuring Daesh cannot establish a geographic foothold in the region.  Payne said Australia was concerned with Islamic State fighters returning from Iraq and Syria to home countries in Southeast Asia and was working closely with Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore to monitor militant movements. Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said in the same briefing the government had been provided by Kurdish intelligence, through Manila s embassy in Baghdad, with a list of Indonesians, Malaysians and a few Filipinos who might return home. Lorenzana said the Philippines and Australia are now reviewing the deployment of surveillance planes, which flew four times a week over Marawi since late June. Apart from urban warfare training, Australia will also  enhance provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability, share information and intelligence and strengthen maritime security engagement and bilateral maritime patrols. An increasing number of Australian warships are expected to make visits to Manila. Canberra is also emerging to be the top source of education and training for local troops.

Russian presidential hopeful says she won't sling mud at Putin,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ksenia Sobchak, a Russian TV personality planning to run against Vladimir Putin in next year s presidential election, attacked his policies on Tuesday but said she would not personally insult him in the campaign because he was a family friend. Sobchak, 35, and the daughter of a former mayor of St Petersburg for whom Putin once worked, said she does not expect to beat Putin, who is a runaway favorite for re-election in March if he chooses to run again. But she said she wants to provide an alternative choice for Russian voters who are frustrated with mainstream politicians. Alexei Navalny, a fierce critic of Putin, has said he believes Sobchak is being used by the Kremlin to blunt protests by liberals alienated from the political process, though she has  denied doing the Kremlin s bidding.  I tell you honestly: I m running against everyone, and this refers to Vladimir Putin,  she said. But she added:  I personally will not insult Putin.   For some, he is a tyrant and dictator ... but for me this is a person who, first of all, helped my father in a difficult situation and de facto saved his life,  she told a news conference to unveil her campaign team. She did however state her opposition to Putin possibly running for a fourth term in power.  I am against the corrupt system which was built in our country during these years and I am against anyone, including Putin, being in power for 18 years.   The fact that the country has no fair elections is the result of those 18 years.  Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, a reformist Petersburg mayor who hired Putin as an official in City Hall in the 1990s. Sobchak became his mentor. Sobchak lost the mayor s job in a 1996 election. He later moved to France and became the subject of a criminal investigation in Russia for receiving bribes and abuse of office. He denied wrongdoing, saying the case was politically-motivated. The case against him was dropped in 1999, soon after Putin became prime minister. When Sobchak died in 2000, Putin attended his funeral.  Opinion polls show that Putin, 65, who has dominated Russian politics for nearly two decades, will comfortably win re-election if, as most analysts expect, he decides to seek a fourth term in March. He has so far kept silent about his plans. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Pakistan PM tells Tillerson it has 'produced results' in fighting terrorism,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday reconfirmed Pakistan s commitment to the  war on terror  during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, saying his country had  produced results  fighting the region s Islamist militants.  Relations between uneasy allies United States and Pakistan have frayed in recent years, with Washington accusing Islamabad of turning a blind eye or helping Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants who stage attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies doing so. President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough with Pakistan unless it changed its behavior, with U.S. officials threatening further reductions in aid and mooting targeted sanctions against Pakistani officials. Tillerson, on a tour of Asia and the Middle East, arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday afternoon and met with Abbasi, as well as Pakistan s powerful army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa.  We are committed in the war against terror, ,  Abbasi told Tillerson, as the two men sat facing each other on a long table.  We have produced results. And we are looking forward to moving ahead with the U.S. and building a tremendous relationship,  added Abbasi, who sat next to Bajwa. During a short part of the meeting available to media, Tillerson told the Pakistani delegation that the nuclear-armed nation was an important U.S. ally in the region.  (Pakistan is) important regionally to our joint goals of providing peace and security to the region and providing opportunity for greater economic relationship as well,  Tillerson said. As well as support for the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network, another sticking point in the relationship has been growing closeness by the United States to India, Pakistan s arch-foe and neighbor.  Tillerson said last week that the Trump administration wanted to  dramatically deepen  cooperation with New Delhi, partly to offset Chinese influence in Asia. Trump has also called for greater Indian role in Afghanistan. But this deepening in ties has alarmed Pakistan, which has rejected a greater political role for India for Afghanistan as a  red line  for Islamabad. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
French judiciary creaking under weight of terrorism cases,"PARIS (Reuters) - France s efforts to combat terrorism and prevent further attacks on its soil are generating so much work for investigators and law courts that further staffing will be needed to keep up, intelligence and justice officials say. The warning comes at a time when President Emmanuel Macron is trying to curb public spending while ensuring security is not compromised, a balancing act that has already prompted an army commander to resign over budget cuts. The workload of the anti-terrorism justice system has risen ten-fold in the past five years, ministry figures show, with a sharp increase since 2014, when followers of the Islamic State group specifically called for attacks targeting the French. More than 240 people have been killed in the past three years in France, including 130 by a group of IS-inspired gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris in November 2015.  Statistics collected by the justice services underscore the scale of the judicial challenge.  In all of 2012, the year Islamist militant Mohammad Merah killed three Jewish schoolchildren and three soldiers near Toulouse - an attack now regarded as a turning point, there were 10 cases of suspected terrorist activity. In 2016, 240 new terrorism-related cases were opened, while in the first three months of 2017 a further 130 were added.  The total workload as of Oct. 9 was 621 cases, of which 452 were either early-stage or full inquiries into suspected Islamist-militant activity, according to justice officials. The number of counter-terrorist investigators at the Paris prosecutor s office has doubled since 2012, but still stands at only 14. Alongside them, the number of so-called investigating magistrates and judges dedicated to counter-terrorism has risen to 11 from 7-8, with another beginning next year.  We are not at breaking point, but the question now is how long it can last like that,  said Pascal Gastineau, head of the French Association of Investigating Magistrates. The workload is piling up in the courts as France cracks down on those who leave for Iraq and Syria to join IS, a number estimated at between 1,800 and 2,000. In the past, terrorism-related convictions meant around 10 years in prison. Now many of those who finance, recruit, join or return from the wars in Syria and Iraq face 20 years in jail. But convictions and the heavier sentences in most cases now require trial by jury of professional magistrates, a slow process that compounds the backlog.  For affairs dating to 2016, a trial will not take place before 2018-2019,  said one judge, who argues for some form of streamlining to process cases more rapidly. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Italy ready to discuss calls for greater autonomy: Gentiloni,"VENICE (Reuters) - The Italian government is ready to open negotiations with Lombardy and Veneto after the two wealthy regions voted overwhelmingly for greater autonomy, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Tuesday. Unlike a recent referendum on independence in Catalonia, which sparked a political crisis in Spain, the Italian votes this weekend were legal, but not binding on Rome. Making clear he had no intention of making a drama out of the twin ballots, Gentiloni said he was ready to discuss how Lombardy and Veneto wanted to proceed.  Here we are talking about how to make Italy work better. We are not calling into question Italy and its unity,  Gentiloni said during a visit to an oil refinery close to Venice, the capital of the northeastern Veneto region.  The government is ready to look into the merits of this ... it will be a complex discussion that can t be done in five minutes,  he added. Regional governments have the right to ask for greater oversight in 23 policy areas, including the environment, infrastructure, health and education. The most delicate negotiations are likely to be over tax returns, with Veneto demanding that it be allowed to spend 90 percent of all the taxes raised on its own territory. Among Italy s 20 regions, Lombardy and Veneto account for just under a third of its economic output and are home to around 25 percent of its population. Italy s poorer, less developed southern regions are worried that they will receive less funding in future if Lombardy and Veneto get to keep more of their own tax take. Five regions in Italy   the islands of Sicily and Sardinia and three relatively small border areas with linguistic minorities   already have special autonomous status under the constitution. Veneto wants to join them. However, this would need a change to the constitution, which the government seems unwilling to accept.  We are ready (to grant greater powers) within the limits fixed by our laws and by our constitution,  Gentiloni said. Negotiations are likely to take many months and look certain to be interrupted by national elections due by next May. Any deal between the government and the regions will have to be approved by parliament.  The latest opinion polls suggest a hung parliament will emerge from the forthcoming election, making it impossible to predict the government formation that will carry on the negotiations.

"No 'bespoke' Brexit, transition means 'status quo': Barnier","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said Britain must accept the full economic and legal status quo in a transition period after it leaves the EU and should expect no tailor-made terms on trade in its future relationship. Suggesting a transition should run for 21 months from Brexit on March 30, 2019 until the current EU budget expires at the end of 2020, Barnier said Britain would  certainly  remain subject to EU laws and courts during that transition.  During this period, the EU legal framework including on jurisdiction would continue to apply to Britain,  Barnier said in an interview published on Tuesday in Germany s Handelsblatt newspaper.  We don t have time to invent a new model. So for a short time after the formal exit from the EU the economic status quo would continue to apply, which besides the internal market also includes the customs union and collective political decisions.  In a version of the interview in Belgium s L Echo, he said of the transition:  The only difference is that the British would no longer take part in decisions on European legislation.  British Prime Minister Theresa May has proposed a transition of around two years to give time to put a new free trade pact in place, although she faces opposition in London from some Brexit supporters who want a clean, quick break. Barnier noted that May had rejected the option of staying in the EU single market long-term   the  Norwegian model  as he called it, referring to Norway s membership of the EU internal market, accepting all its rules and costs without having a say.  So we must work on other hypotheses,  Handelsblatt quoted him as saying.  Another option would be a free trade treaty using the example of the CETA agreement with Canada. It would take several years, however, to negotiate such an agreement.  Asked if that meant there could be  a specifically British model  along the lines of the  bespoke arrangements  May has referred to without giving detail, Barnier replied simply:  No.  Quoted by L Echo, he said a trade deal could be agreed in three years   meaning that if talks start in December it would be ready just in time for a transition ending in December 2020. He said his staff were already working on drafting a withdrawal treaty that will include terms for transition. Barnier said he still hoped that May could provide more detail on her offer to meet financial commitments on withdrawal so that EU leaders could agree in December to end their refusal to negotiate a future trade deal. May told an EU summit last week that she could not agree a figure until she knows what trade terms the EU offers. Barnier said it was important to  de-dramatise  talks on the payment.

Austrian conservative Kurz and far right to hold coalition talks,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz will hold coalition talks with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), both sides said on Tuesday, bringing the anti-immigration party a step closer to power, which it last held more than a decade ago. Having won last week s parliamentary election with 31.5 percent of the vote, Kurz s party is far short of a majority, needing a partner to gain control of parliament and form a stable government. Only two parties have enough seats to do that with   the Social Democrats (SPO) and the FPO. Kurz, 31, took a hard line on immigration in the campaign that left little space between him and the FPO, and both parties capitalized on a widespread feeling that the country had been overrun during Europe s migration crisis in 2015 and 2016. He called for an end to the current coalition with the SPO when he took over as leader of the People s Party (OVP) in May, arguing in favor of a break with Austria s tradition of often deadlocked centrist coalitions. That left the FPO, a party founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, a more willing partner.  I have therefore decided to invite (FPO leader) Heinz-Christian Strache and the FPO today to take part in coalition talks,  Kurz told a news conference. Strache soon accepted, saying teams from both parties would meet on Wednesday but adding that the FPO would not strike a deal at any cost.  Being part of the government is not an end in itself and only makes sense if we can implement our correct and important policies,  Strache told a news conference.  Therefore no one should think that we will make it easy for the OVP.  Some European leaders have expressed concern about the possible return to power of the FPO, which first became a major force in the 1990s under the late Joerg Haider, who praised Hitler s employment policies.  The party has steadily increased its mainstream appeal in recent years. It says it has turned its back on its Nazi past, though it still frequently has to expel members for anti-Semitic statements. It has also dropped calls for Austria to leave the European Union as most Austrians back membership.  Kurz has sought to allay such concerns and repeated on Tuesday that any government must have a  clear pro-European orientation , though he also wants a streamlined EU that focuses on core tasks like trade and protecting external borders.  Strache said he backed that view of Europe, the fourth of five scenarios for the future of the bloc laid out by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in March, which Strache called  less but better .  Strache and Kurz on Tuesday both emphasized the importance of cutting taxes. Both believe in restricting benefits for foreigners and making the state more efficient, but the FPO also wants to increase some benefits like the minimum state pension.  In terms of content there are some things that unite us and others that divide us,  Kurz said in a typically vague answer on his expectations of a deal. He hopes to have an agreement by Christmas. The FPO has made control of the Interior Ministry a condition for any deal, but it did not mention that on Tuesday. The OVP and FPO went into government together in 2000, which prompted the rest of the EU to impose short-lived sanctions on Austria over the FPO s accession to power. Given the more guarded response to Austria s election in the aftermath of the migration crisis and the rise of other right-wing parties like France s National Front and the Alliance for Germany, a new tie-up between them is unlikely to provoke the same outrage.

"China says it has freed Swedish bookseller, his whereabouts still unknown","STOCKHOLM/BEIJING (Reuters) - A Swedish bookseller detained in China after publishing books on the personal lives of President Xi Jinping and other Communist Party leaders has been released, Chinese authorities said on Tuesday. The whereabouts of Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swede, could not be confirmed, however, and he has yet to contact his family.   Gui was abducted in Thailand while on holiday in 2015, one of five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing that year and later appeared in mainland Chinese custody. The four others have returned to Hong Kong. Chinese authorities say Gui was involved in a traffic accident in 2003, although that is questioned by his family.  According to what we understand, because Gui Minhai has served his sentence for the crime of causing traffic accident casualties, he was released on Oct. 17,  the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters. The Swedish Foreign Ministry said it had been informed by its Chinese counterpart of Gui s release and that it was working to confirm the information.  However, Gui s family questioned if he really was free. His daughter said he had made no contact with her or any other relatives.   Today it has been a week since October 17 and I still do not know where my father is,  Angela Gui said in a statement.  I am deeply concerned for his wellbeing.      The report of Gui s release coincides with the end of China s 19th Communist Party congress which has further consolidated President Xi Jinping s power. Lam Wing-kee, one of the other four booksellers, told Reuters he did not know Gui s whereabouts.   Lam said he feared the government of Xi would further erode the  one country, two systems  formula that is supposed to guarantee Hong Kong a large degree of autonomy under Chinese rule.   He (Xi) will continue to tighten things (for Hong Kong). There will be no loosening,  he said. Earlier this year, Gui won a prize for free speech and press freedom awarded by Swedish media organization Publicistklubben. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Dutch far-right politician Wilders appeals discrimination verdict,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch politician Geert Wilders questioned the objectivity of the judge hearing his appeal on Tuesday against a conviction last December for inciting discrimination, in a trial he said was politically motivated. On the first day of preliminary hearings Wilders confronted presiding judge Jeanne Gaakeer with her leading role in a foundation that awarded an academic prize in 2016 to someone he called  a left-wing activist .  This concerns me and raises the question whether you are the right person to judge me,  Wilders said, adding that the award winner  has helped organize a large anti-Wilders protest... and represents everything I fight against politically . The judge gave no immediate reaction to Wilders  remarks, but said she would discuss her position with the other members of the three-judge panel after the conclusion of the day s hearings.      Wilders  far right Party for Freedom came second in elections in March, but he was locked out of coalition talks with mainstream parties and now leads the opposition in parliament.     The case against the 54-year-old stemmed from a 2014 campaign rally at which he led chants calling for fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands. He was found guilty but received no sentence and was acquitted of a separate count of inciting hatred. The prosecution, which had sought a fine of 5,000 euros without a prison sentence, has also appealed against the verdict. Wilders  lawyer said the verdict had been a  fatal blow  to freedom of speech.   What should have been the trial of the century on the freedom of speech, became an absolute low point , lawyer Geert-Jan Knoops said in court. This week judges will hear the grounds for appeal from both parties before the full case commences in May. The hearings are being held at a special high-security courtroom. Wilders has lived in safe houses under 24-hour guard since 2004 to protect him from Islamist militants who threatened to kill him. At the 2014 rally, Wilders led a group of supporters chanting that they wanted  Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!  in reference to the number of people of Moroccan origin in the Netherlands.  There are around 400,000 people of Moroccan origin among the Netherlands  population of 17 million people.  As in other EU states such as Germany and France, anti-immigration sentiment in the Netherlands has risen in recent years. Wilders has called for the borders to be closed to immigrants from Muslim countries and mosques to be shut down.  A previous attempt to prosecute Wilders for anti-Islam remarks, such as likening the religion to Nazism and calling for a ban on the Koran, ended in acquittal in 2011.

Iraqi Kurdistan parliament delays presidential elections by eight months,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Elections for the presidency and parliament of Iraq s Kurdistan region set for Nov. 1 have been delayed by eight months, the regional parliament announced on Tuesday. The decision came after the electoral commission said on Monday that political parties had failed to present candidates for both elections amid turmoil in the region following the independence referendum it held on Sept. 25. The proposal to delay the two elections was approved by 60 of 68 MPs who attended the parliamentary session in the Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil, Rudaw TV said. Eight MPs opposed the proposal and 43 didn t attend, mainly politicians opposed to Kurdistan Regional Government President Masoud Barzani, one of the MPs said. Last week, Iraqi forces captured the oil city of Kirkuk and other territory claimed by the Kurds in retaliation for holding the referendum, dealing a severe blow to Barzani. The current KRG presidency, held by Barzani since 2005, and parliament, elected in 2013, are expected to continue until new votes are held. The loss of Kirkuk prompted calls from Gorran, the main opposition party, for Barzani to resign. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
UK Supreme Court hears attempt to change Northern Ireland abortion law,"LONDON (Reuters) - An attempt to change the law in Northern Ireland to allow abortions in cases of rape, incest or serious malformation of the fetus started in the UK Supreme Court on Tuesday with harrowing accounts of women s experiences. A socially conservative province where the Catholic and Protestant faiths exert strong influence, Northern Ireland allows abortion only when a mother s life is in danger. The penalty for undergoing or performing an unlawful abortion is life imprisonment. As a result, women facing tragic circumstances such as a pregnancy resulting from rape or a diagnosis of fatal fetal abnormality, meaning that a baby will not survive outside the womb, have been forced to carry their pregnancies to term.  The impact of the criminal law in Northern Ireland does amount to inhuman and degrading treatment by the state,  said Nathalie Lieven, lead counsel for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission which is spearheading the legal action. The commission, an independent body, launched legal action against Northern Ireland s government in 2014, arguing that the law violates the human rights of women and girls. The case has been working its way through the courts ever since. A panel of seven Supreme Court judges in London will hear arguments for and against the proposed changes during a three-day hearing. They will give their judgment at a later date. Lieven began by giving the judges an overview of detailed evidence provided by several women and girls. One of them, Ashleigh Topley, was told when she was four-and-a-half months pregnant in 2013 that her baby s limbs were not growing and she was going to die. Topley was told there was nothing to be done and she had to carry on with the pregnancy until her baby died inside the womb, or until she went into labor which would cause the baby to die. Topley had to endure 15 weeks of anguish as the pregnancy progressed. She has described how people would ask her if it was her first child, if she wanted a boy or a girl, and other well-meaning questions which exacerbated her suffering. In the end, Topley went into labor at 35 weeks and the baby girl s heart stopped. Other cases described to the judges included that of a girl under 13 years old who was pregnant as a result of sexual abuse by a relative. After police and social services got involved, the distraught girl had to be taken outside of Northern Ireland for the first time in her life to have an abortion. Northern Ireland s elected assembly voted against changing abortion laws in February 2016. The law is far less restrictive in the rest of the United Kingdom, and hundreds of Northern Irish women travel to England every year to have unwanted pregnancies terminated. As well as the parties in the case, the court will hear from organizations that support changing the law, such as Humanists UK, Amnesty International and a United Nations working group on discrimination against women.  It will also hear from groups who oppose any reform, such as Catholic bishops from the province and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which describes the legal action as a  crusade against disabled babies .

Six crew from German ship kidnapped in Nigerian waters,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Six crew from a German container vessel have been kidnapped in Nigerian waters, a shipping company said on Tuesday. Four of those taken are Filipino, and one is a Ukrainian national, according to the Philippines department of labor and Ukrainian foreign ministry. Kidnapping for ransom is a common problem in parts of Nigeria. A number of foreigners have, in the last few years, been kidnapped in the Niger Delta, source of most of the crude oil which is Nigeria s economic mainstay.  The vessel was attacked by pirates on early Saturday morning when it was approaching one of the ports of Nigeria,  said a spokesman for Peter Doehle Schiffahrts KG.  Six of the crew were taken off the ship and they are now held by kidnappers in Nigeria,  he said. There were no German nationals among the kidnapped but the spokesman declined to say where those abducted were from. Those kidnapped comprise four Filipinos, one Ukrainian and one Hungarian, officials from the countries involved told Reuters. At the time of the statement there was no official contact with the kidnappers and the vessel had moved away from Nigerian waters with the 12 remaining crew safe, the spokesman said.  The top priority is to try and establish contact with the kidnappers and try to have a quick and safe release of our seafarers,  he said. Germany s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Four of the six abducted crew members are Filipinos, the Philippines labor secretary told Reuters. An official at Ukraine s foreign ministry said preliminary information indicated a Ukrainian citizen was among those kidnapped. He gave no further details.     One Hungarian national was also taken, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the rescue operations. The Hungarian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Chaotic scenes as suspects wheeled around airport where North Korean leader's brother killed,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Handcuffed, wearing bulletproof vests and under heavily armed guard, the two women accused of murdering the half-brother of North Korea s leader were pushed around a Malaysian airport in wheelchairs on Tuesday during a court visit to the crime scene. Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical nerve agent, at Kuala Lumpur s budget international terminal on Feb. 13. Defense lawyers say the women thought they were involved in a prank for a reality TV show when they encountered a man at the airport and did not know they were handling poison. The two women were brought back to the scene as part of an entourage of court officials, led by trial judge Azmi Ariffin and accompanied by over 200 police officers and dozens of journalists, on a visit to retrace the events that unfolded before, during and after Kim Jong Nam s death. Defense lawyers requested the visit after video recordings of the women on airport closed-circuit television were screened in court. Gooi Soon Seng, Siti Aisyah s lawyer, said the visit was necessary to verify the surroundings and locations where the prosecution say the murder took place.  The CCTV footages were taken from various cameras and various places, so from there we couldn t get a complete picture on how (the incident) took place,  Gooi told a news conference after the visit. The site visit covered various locations in the terminal shown in the videos, such as a restaurant where Siti Aisyah was seen meeting an unidentified man, the toilets where police witnesses said both women had gone to after the attack on Kim Jong Nam, the clinic where the victim sought medical aid and the taxi stands where both suspects were seen after the attack. Huong appeared unwell midway through the three-hour site visit, while Siti Aisyah broke down in tears. Both women were then provided wheelchairs. Defense lawyers later said both Huong and Siti Aisyah were exhausted from being weighed down by their bulletproof vests. Recordings on Feb. 13 show Huong approaching Kim and grasping his face from behind near the airport s check-in counters before quickly leaving. Siti Aisyah could not be seen but was identified by a police witness as a figure running in another direction. The videos also show the women heading to separate bathrooms to wash their hands. Both women were seen meeting with two men, identified only as Mr. Chang and Mr. Y, before Kim Jong Nam s death. According to police, the men had applied liquid on the women s hands, and were among four suspects-at-large charged together with the women for the murder.  CLOSELY-WATCHED TRIAL      The airport visit comes as the high-profile trial entered its third week. Twelve witnesses have testified so far. Forensic and chemical weapons experts said Kim Jong Nam had died of nerve agent poisoning, and that VX had been found on Siti Aisyah and Huong s clothes. Traces of the poison were also found under Huong s fingernails. Prosecutors say Siti Aisyah and Huong conspired with four others who are still at large to kill Kim Jong Nam. South Korean and U.S. officials have said that Kim Jong Un s regime was behind his half-brother s death. Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had ordered his execution, according to some South Korean lawmakers. The hearing resumes in court on Wednesday. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Egypt security forces arrest 12 suspected militants south of Cairo: ministry,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian security forces have arrested 12 suspected members of the Islamist militant Hasm Movement in the province of Fayoum 60 km (40 miles) south of Cairo, the Interior Ministry said on Tuesday. A ministry statement said police also confiscated a number of weapons and explosive devices. Hasm, a group that emerged last year and has claimed several attacks on security forces, including the fatal shooting of a policeman and injuries to three others in the province. Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the country s oldest Islamist movement which Cairo outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this and says it strives only for peaceful political change. An insurgency led by Islamic State militants in Egypt s rugged Sinai Peninsula has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen since the Egyptian military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013 - although no official death toll has been released to date. Attacks have increasingly moved to the mainland in recent months, targeting Coptic Christians as well as security officers and checkpoints in and around major Egyptian cities.

Indian state ruled by PM Modi's party defers media curbs until next year,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India s western state of Rajasthan on Tuesday deferred until next year a measure requiring government permission for the publication of details regarding judges and public servants who face accusations over action taken in the course of their duty. The measure, which prescribes jail terms of up to two years for violations, aimed to minimise frivolous complaints against officials, said the government of the state, ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi s Hindu nationalist party. In recent years many journalists reporting corruption and attacks on minorities in India have complained of being targeted by online smear campaigns, although there have been no reports of measures elsewhere similar to what Rajasthan proposed. The Editors  Guild of India and the opposition Congress party called Rajasthan s move an attempt to curb media freedom and shield corrupt individuals, criticisms that forced the state to delay discussion on the bill.  The government has agreed to refer the bill to a panel of legislature members,  a state government spokesman told Reuters by telephone, adding that the bill could be introduced, following amendments, in the next assembly session early next year. When introduced this week in the state assembly, it set a six-month deadline for courts to secure the government s permission for any investigations into the actions of judges, magistrates or public servants. In the absence of such permission, it also sought to block publication of the identity, or other personal, or family details of those being investigated. ""No one shall print or publish, or publicize in any manner, the name, address, photograph, family details, or any other particulars which may lead to disclosure of identity of a judge or magistrate or a public servant,"" it added. (bit.ly/2i0w5GZ) The bill s passage by the state legislature would have helped turn into law an executive decree on the subject issued in September that would otherwise have lapsed within six months. When asked about the status of the decree, the state government spokesman declined to comment. Rajasthan was only trying to  shield honest officers so that they can perform their duty , Indian Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters on Monday, but declined further comment,  saying it was a state matter. India has slipped three places to 136 in the 2017 world press freedom rankings of 180 countries, amid growing ""self-censorship"" and attacks by right-wing groups. (rsf.org/en/india)  In a statement, Raj Chengappa, president of the Editors  Guild of India, described the Rajasthan bill as  a pernicious instrument to harass the media, hide wrongful acts by government servants and drastically curb the freedom of the press .

Former Finance Minister Schaeuble elected to head German parliament,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Former German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was elected president of Germany s Bundestag or lower house of parliament, on Tuesday at its first session after Sept. 24 elections. Schaeuble, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, agreed last month to step aside as finance minister, clearing the way for another party to take the job as part of tricky negotiations to forge a new coalition government. Schaeuble, 75, is known for his hardline insistence on a balanced budget and his leadership during the euro zone crisis, but he faces new challenges in leading the Bundestag, which will include a far-right party - the Alternative for Germany (AfD) - for the first time in decades.

Indonesia passes law to ban organizations deemed against its ideology,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Around 1,000 Indonesians, led by hardline Islamist groups, protested outside parliament on Tuesday as lawmakers approved a presidential decree banning any civil organizations deemed to go against the country s secular state ideology. Tuesday s approval puts into law a policy President Joko Widodo set in a decree in July. The policy was aimed at containing hardline groups who have cast a shadow over the long-standing reputation for religious tolerance in the world s largest Muslim-majority nation.      We have seen mass organizations that are against the Pancasila (state ideology) and have created social conflict,  said Arya Bima, a lawmaker in favour of the policy.  This law doesn t impede freedom of organization or assembly, it strengthens it.   In late 2016 and early this year, groups such as Hizb-ut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) and the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), which call for Islamic law to be imposed in Indonesia, led mass street rallies attacking Jakarta s governor, a Christian, whom they accused of insulting Islam.  Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who in April lost an election to get a new term, was jailed one month later after being convicted of blasphemy, in a court ruling widely criticized in Indonesia and overseas as unjust.  The presidential decree Widodo signed in July ordered the disbanding of all organizations deemed to be in conflict with the secular state ideology. HTI, which seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate, was the first organization to be disbanded under the policy. Pancasila or  five principles  is Indonesia s state ideology, which includes belief in god, the unity of the country, social justice and democracy, and which enshrines religious diversity in an officially secular system. Under the new law, anyone who  embraces, develops of spreads ideology that is in conflict with the (state ideology) Pancasila  can face imprisonment of six months to life, according to a copy of the draft law reviewed by Reuters. Rights activists and civil organizations have decried the move, saying it harks back to the era of authoritarian ruler Suharto, who demanded loyalty to Pancasila and took repressive measures against some opponents. Opposition lawmaker Al Muzamil Yusuf said the new law could  violate democratic rights and remove checks and balances on the government .     During the protest outside parliament on Tuesday, around 5,200 police and military personnel stood guard around the complex in central Jakarta.  A hashtag supporting Widodo s policy was a top trending topic on Indonesian Twitter.  This policy is not about (Widodo) or any political party, it s about safeguarding the unity of the country,  said user @Senopati.     ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Pressure on as Xi's 'Belt and Road' enshrined in Chinese party charter,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping s vast  Belt and Road  infrastructure project was unexpectedly included in the ruling Communist Party s constitution on Tuesday, giving it greater policy heft and added pressure to succeed. The party s amended charter, approved at the close of its twice-a-decade congress, pledged to  pursue the Belt and Road initiative , a further sign of Xi s expanding power and evidence that the ambitious  Silk Road -like initiative will endure beyond Xi s tenure. It also underscores how the Communist Party has increased its attention to foreign policy and reflects Xi s growing desire for China to take a global leadership role, analysts said.  Everyone knows that the Belt and Road is very important to Xi, it has his personal stamp and authority,  said Peter Cai, a non-resident fellow at Sydney-based think tank Lowy Institute.  But to have major policy, especially an external engagement policy, to be written into a party constitution, at least in recent memory, it is something quite significant,  he said. First mentioned during a speech Xi gave to university students in Kazakhstan in 2013, the plan is a vehicle for China to take a greater role on the international stage by funding and building global transport and trade links in more than 60 countries. Xi has heavily promoted the initiative, inviting world leaders to Beijing in May for an inaugural summit at which he pledged $124 billion ( 94 billion) in funding for the plan. Local Chinese governments as well as state and private firms have rushed to offer support by investing overseas and making loans.  Some critics argue that China is exporting excess industrial capacity to spread its influence, and that the initiative, which has seen developing countries take on heavy debt, needs higher standards of governance and transparency.  China has made commitments and pledges to many developing countries and it will take that length of time, 10 years or more, to complete the initiative,  said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit.  This has also strengthened China s soft power globally, so it wouldn t make sense for China s point of view to suddenly pull away from all of this,  he said.   Other analysts said its inclusion could be a double-edged sword that adds pressure for the initiative, which remains broadly defined and leaves much to interpretation, to succeed.  The danger of having given it greater visibility is that actually there are going to be more of those efforts to play to the policy in a political way rather than considering carefully the costs and benefits of each portion of what one is doing,  said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago. Many private investors have jumped on the bandwagon to describe their projects as Belt and Road-related, while local governments have rolled out individual Belt and Road plans.  The heads of Chinese firms including China Communications Construction Co and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation [SASAAI.UL] told Reuters during the week-long congress that they would place greater focus on developing their overseas businesses in support of the Belt and Road initiative. The party congress saw Xi cement his power ahead of a second five-year term and put him in the same company as the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, with the enshrinement of his political thought into the country s constitution.

Poland's PM Szydlo to reshuffle cabinet soon,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s Prime Minister Beata Szydlo will announce a cabinet reshuffle in coming days, she said on Tuesday, declining to respond to talk that her own job might be at risk. Media and market speculation about a reshuffle has been rife, with the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party thought to be planning to get rid of some ministers weighing on the party s broadly positive popularity ratings as it prepares for regional elections in 2018. On Monday, weekly Sieci Prawdy suggested Szydlo, 54, might herself be replaced by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who heads the right-wing PiS to which they both belong. Tabloid Fakt said on Tuesday that Szydlo was likely to keep her job, but that others including Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski and Environment Minister Jan Szyszko    both relatively unpopular among the electorate   might be replaced.         Kaczynski, 68, a divisive figure who is one of the least trusted politicians in Poland, exerts huge influence behind the scenes and media have said he might be targeting Szydlo s job ahead of national elections due in 2019.   I do not want the speculation regarding changes in the government to continue. My decisions will be announced soon,  Szydlo told private broadcaster TVN 24.  This decision has been taken - there will be changes in the government. I have discussed this decision with Jaroslaw Kaczynski, which is a natural thing.  Asked about her own possible departure, Szydlo said she did not want to speculate, adding she was not tired or burned out. Opinion polls show Szydlo is the second most trusted politician in Poland, just behind President Andrzej Duda.  If the reshuffle is limited to a few ministers, then it will done out of the natural desire to get rid of the weakest links (in the cabinet),  said Jaroslaw Flis, a sociologist at the Krakow-based Jagiellonian University. The PiS government has divided opinion, putting Poland on a collision course with the EU with policies including increasing control over the judiciary and state media that critics say undermine the rule of law. But the party continues to enjoy strong backing from voters. In a survey released (when) by state pollster CBOS, 44 percent of respondents described themselves as supporters of the government, the largest share in six years. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

Philippines environment minister hopeful for end to open-pit mining ban,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines  environment minister said he was hopeful that a ban on open-pit mining would be lifted before the end of the year after a government panel recommended its removal on Tuesday. Lifting the ban would allow the development of some big-ticket mining projects including the $5.9 billion Tampakan copper and gold mine. Open-pit mining is allowed under the mining laws of the Southeast Asian country, the world s top nickel ore exporter. However, the former environment minister Regina Lopez banned it during her 10 months in office, saying the environmental degradation ruined the economic potential of places where it was done. A staunch environmentalist, Lopez stepped down in May after she failed to win congressional confirmation. Roy Cimatu, a former soldier, replaced her and was confirmed in his post by lawmakers earlier this month. The Mining Industry Coordinating Council said in a statement that a majority of the panel voted to recommend that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources  lift the ban on open pit mining provided that mining laws, rules and regulations are strictly enforced.  Cimatu, who co-chaired the council with Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, said he will follow the recommendation and present it at a Cabinet meeting in the first week of November.  Asked whether the ban will likely be lifted before the end of the year, Cimatu said:  Hopefully.   We will strengthen the regulatory environment surrounding the implementation of open-pit mining,  he told reporters. The Tampakan project in South Cotabato province on the island of Mindanao is the nation s biggest stalled mining venture. Its development was halted after South Cotabato banned open-pit mining in 2010, prompting operator Glencore Plc to quit the project in 2015.  Lopez has said the project would cover an area the size of 700 soccer fields in what otherwise would be agricultural land. Removing the ban would may also lead to the resumption of development of the $1.2 billion Silangan copper and gold mine , also in Mindanao, by Philippine miner Philex Mining Corp. Miners praised the panel s recommendation, saying it is a positive step for the industry.  Open-pit mining is an accepted method worldwide to extract shallow mineral deposits and a lot of our minerals are exactly that,  Ronald Recidoro, executive director of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines, told Reuters by phone.  The challenge is for it to be done safely and the environment is protected during and after the mining is accomplished.  However, President Rodrigo Duterte said last month he supported the open-pit mining ban given the environmental damage it causes though he would give mining firms time to find other ways to extract minerals. Lopez, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said open-pit mines pose  very high risks in tropical and archipelagic countries like the Philippines  where strong typhoons are normal.  The Philippines is not a fit and proper place for open pit mining,  she said. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

UK lawmakers ask Facebook for any evidence of Russian-linked Brexit activity,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British parliamentary committee has written to Facebook s Mark Zuckerberg asking for information on any paid-for activity by Russian-linked Facebook accounts around the 2016 EU referendum and the 2017 UK election. The request was made by Damian Collins, chair of parliament s Digital, Media and Sport Committee as part of its effort to gather evidence for an inquiry it is conducting into fake news.  Part of this inquiry will focus on the role of foreign actors abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations,  Collins wrote in a letter to Zuckerberg circulated to media by the committee. He asked Facebook to provide examples of all adverts bought by Russian-linked accounts, of all pages set up by Russian-linked accounts, information on the targeting of such adverts and pages and how many times they were viewed.  I believe that the information I have requested is in line with that already supplied to Facebook to several United States Senate Committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, in relation to the 2016 U.S. presidential election,  wrote Collins. The committee of British lawmakers launched its inquiry into fake news in January but it was suspended when a general election was called for June. The closing date for submitting evidence is Nov. 7. The inquiry aims to shed light on issues such as the impact of fake news on public understanding of the world and response to traditional journalism, the responsibilities of social media platforms and how people can be educated to assess news sources. The issue of whether and how much Russia intervened in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is a huge issue in Washington, where it is the subject of multiple investigations. Facebook said on Oct. 2 that some 10 million people in the United States saw politically divisive ads on its network that were purchased in Russia in the months before and after the presidential election. In Britain, interest in whether Russia also played a part in domestic political processes such as the June 2016 referendum on withdrawing from the European Union and the June 2017 general election has been increasing in recent weeks. Last week, another member of parliament, Ben Bradshaw, called on the government to get to the bottom of reports of opaque funding sources for some elements of the pro-Brexit campaign, citing  widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference . Russia has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
"China, Southeast Asia aim to build trust with sea drills, Singapore says","CLARK, Philippines (Reuters) - China and Southeast Asian navies aim to hold an inaugural joint maritime exercise next year, Singapore s defense minister said on Tuesday, as they try to build trust amid conflicting claims over the South China Sea. China claims almost the entire strategic waters through which about $3 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims, with tensions exacerbated by Beijing s island-building and Washington s increasing freedom of navigation patrols.  Singapore supports it,  Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen told reporters when asked about China s offer to hold maritime exercises.  We will push it ... for the very reason that all ASEAN and China want that. If you exercise, you at least build understanding and trust.  The exercises were discussed at a meeting between China and Singapore on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Defense Ministers  Meeting at the former U.S. air force base at Clark, north of the capital Manila.  We ll work out the details. See the logistics... and find a suitable area where ASEAN and China navies can exercise together,  Ng said. Singapore and China have not always seen eye to eye in recent months. Singaporean troops have trained in self-ruled Taiwan, an island China claims as its own, which had been an irritant in ties. Last November, Chinese-controlled Hong Kong impounded nine Singaporean armored military vehicles being shipped home from Taiwan, inflaming tension. Hong Kong later released the vehicles. Ng said Singapore also had a proposal to  reduce risk of actual conflict  by agreeing to a new code of unexpected encounters in the air after ASEAN adopted a code to avoid sea encounters.  ASEAN and its eight regional partners, the United States, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand, had agreed to set up a  direct communications link  among them to ease tension. Ng said the United States and Japan also welcomed the idea of exercises.   Secretary (of Defense Jim) Mattis welcomed the exercises together with ASEAN countries,  he said. Ng also hoped for the early conclusion of a code of conduct in the South China Sea after a framework agreement was reached this year to reduce conflicts and misunderstanding.

"Saudis set $500 billion plan to develop border region with Jordan, Egypt","RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia announced on Tuesday a $500 billion plan to create a business and industrial zone extending across its borders into Jordan and Egypt, the biggest project yet in a series of efforts to free the kingdom of its dependence on oil exports. The 26,500 square km (10,230 square mile) zone, known as NEOM, will focus on industries including energy and water, biotechnology, food, advanced manufacturing and entertainment, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said. Adjacent to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba and near maritime trade routes that use the Suez Canal, the zone will power itself solely with wind power and solar energy, said the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia s top sovereign fund.  NEOM is situated on one of the world s most prominent economic arteries ... Its strategic location will also facilitate the zone s rapid emergence as a global hub that connects Asia, Europe and Africa.  The Saudi government, the PIF, and local and international investors are expected to put more than half a trillion dollars into the zone in coming years, Prince Mohammed said. There was no immediate comment on the plan from Jordan and Egypt, both of which are close allies of Saudi Arabia. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Recovering from severe malnutrition in Yemen,"HODEIDAH, Yemen (Reuters) - Smiling and sitting down to bread and milk with her family, Yemeni teenager Saida Ahmed Baghili is barely recognizable a year on from the photo of her emaciated frame that came to symbolize the country s humanitarian crisis. Baghili now weighs 36kg (80 lb), according to her father, more than triple the 11kg she weighed last October when Reuters first met her at the al-Thawra hospital in Sana a, where she was undergoing treatment for severe malnutrition. There the 19-year-old was unable to talk, let alone carry her ghostly, skeletal frame, which is now stronger after weeks of specialist care and time at home.  Saida s body got better because she s eating better, but she s still having trouble swallowing,  her father Ahmed Baghili said at their home in Hodeidah this month.  She can only eat milk, biscuits and juice.  Baghili s plight reflects that of many families in the Arabian Peninsula s poorest country, where a two-and-a-half-year war between a Saudi-led Arab coalition and the Iran-allied Houthi movement has claimed 10,000 lives. A quarter of the 28 million population are starving, according to the United Nations, with half a million children under the age of 5 severely malnourished and at least 2,135 people killed by cholera. Ahmed Baghili is only able to supply the basics for his family of 10, who live in a parched village on the Red Sea coast. Saida, whose illness began before the war, is able to help her father tend to a farmer s cattle in exchange for milk, with their income boosted by Ahmed making deliveries on his motorcycle and donations from humanitarian organizations.  However, he says he doesn t have enough money to send Saida for further treatment and still fears for her health. Her last appointment with a doctor was in December.  We re worried she might relapse and then we wouldn t be able to do anything because we have nothing. We don t have the transportation fee, we don t have the fee for anything,  he said.

"South Korea to resume building two new nuclear reactors, but scraps plans for 6 others","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will resume the suspended construction of two new nuclear reactors from midnight, its energy ministry said on Tuesday, but has torn up plans to build six more reactors as Seoul seeks to meet pledges to cut reliance on nuclear power. The move will restart work on the two reactors that was frozen after President Moon Jae-in came to power in May on a ticket calling for scaling back nuclear power. It comes after results of a survey unveiled last week found a majority of South Koreans actually backed the projects. The world s fifth-biggest nuclear energy user currently runs 24 nuclear reactors, generating a third of the country s total electricity needs.  Construction work (for the two new nuclear reactors) will begin immediately after midnight,  Paik Un-gyu, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy, told a news briefing in the capital.  But in a bid to press on with Moon s commitment to boost use of natural gas and renewable sources in the nation s energy mix, the ministry said Seoul will also cancel all plans to construct a further six nuclear reactors. The number of nuclear reactors operating in South Korea will be cut to a net 14 by 2038 it said. The ministry said it will use alternative fuels such as solar and wind power to replace the six nuclear reactors with a projected combined capacity of 8.8 gigawatts (GW).     Additionally, the Asia s fourth-largest economy will not allow extending the lifespan of 14 aging nuclear power stations, totaling 12.5 GW of capacity, the statement said. The energy ministry said it will reflect changes in the country s long-term energy mix plan, which is expected to be finalised in November.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
"Tillerson urges Iraq, Kurds to resolve conflict through dialogue","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan region on Monday to resolve their conflict over Kurdish self-determination and disputed territories through dialogue. Tillerson laid out his position at the start of a meeting in Baghdad with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who in turn defended the role of an Iraqi paramilitary force backed by Iran against criticism the secretary of state made on Sunday.  We are concerned and a bit sad,  Tillerson said in his opening remarks.  We have friends in Baghdad and friends in Erbil and we encourage all parties to enter into discussion ... and all differences can be addressed,  he said, referring to the Iraqi and Kurdistan region capitals. The U.S. administration sided with Abadi in rejecting the validity of the referendum held last month in the Kurdish region, which produced an overwhelming yes for Kurdish independence. The administration also called on the two sides to avoid further escalation, after Abadi retaliated against the vote by isolating the Kurdistan region and ordering his troops to seize the oil city of Kirkuk from Kurdish fighters.  We don t want to enter into any battle against any Iraqi component,  Abadi said.  When we entered Kirkuk we sent a clear message that the citizens of Kirkuk are important to us.       It was Tillerson s second meeting with Abadi in as many days. After Sunday s meeting, alongside Saudi Arabia s King Salman, Tillerson said it was time for Iranian-backed militias that had helped Baghdad defeat Islamic State to  go home .  Abadi told Tillerson the paramilitary force called Popular Mobilisation  is part of the Iraqi institutions,  rejecting accusations that it is acting as Iran s proxies.  Popular Mobilisation fighters should be encouraged because they will be the hope of country and the region,  he said. A few hours earlier, Abadi s office published a statement rejecting Tillerson s comments.  No party has the right to interfere in Iraqi matters,  it said [nL8N1MY1UJ]. Washington, which also backed Baghdad against Islamic State, is concerned Iran will use its increased presence in Iraq, and in Syria where it supports President Bashar al-Assad, to expand its influence in the region. Shi ite Muslim Iran s influence in Iraq, where the population is also predominantly Shi ite, has grown since the U.S. invasion of 2003 that overthrew dictator Saddam Hussein, a Sunni.  Iraq s Sunni Muslim neighbours, including Saudi Arabia, share Washington s concern about rising Iranian influence. Tehran has trained and armed the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation forces that have fought, often alongside Iraqi government units, against Islamic State, which was effectively defeated in July when a U.S.-backed offensive captured its stronghold, Mosul. The United States has over 5,000 troops deployed in Iraq and provided critical air and ground support in the offensive on Islamic State. It is also the main backer of the Kurdish-led Syrian coalition that captured the IS stronghold of Raqqa earlier this month. Of the closest groups to Iran within Popular Mobilisation, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, reacted to Tillerson s comment by saying it would be the Americans who will be forced to leave Iraq.  Your forces should get ready to get out of our country once the excuse of Daesh s presence is over,  said Asaib s leader, Sheikh Qais al-Khazali, according to the group s TV channel, al-Aahd.

Hong Kong democracy activists granted bail as they seek to appeal against jail terms,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong s highest court granted bail to two prominent young pro-democracy activists, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, on Tuesday pending an appeal over their jail terms for unlawful assembly linked to the city s mass pro-democracy protests in 2014. Hong Kong s appeals court jailed Wong, 21, Law, 24 and Alex Chow, 27, leaders of the Chinese-ruled city s democracy movement, in August. Their sentencing came as a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompted accusations of political interference. The trio helped lead the largely peaceful  Umbrella Movement  that blocked major roads for 79 days in 2014, demanding Beijing grant Hong Kong full democracy. Hong Kong has been governed under a  one country, two systems  formula since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997, allowing freedoms not enjoyed on mainland China that include an independent judiciary. Hong Kong Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, who heads the Court of Final Appeal, granted Wong and Law bail of HK$50,000 ($6,408) each while they appeal against their respective six-month and eight-month jail terms.  There s no flight risk,  Ma told the court. Chow did not apply for bail.  Ma said a Court of Final Appeal hearing would be held on Nov. 7 to consider the trio s applications for appeal. The next legal steps will likely be scrutinised closely, with the jailings having shaken confidence in Hong Kong s vaunted rule of law. Wong, Chow and Law were sentenced last year to community service for unlawful assembly. However, Reuters reported that Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen had overruled other senior colleagues to re-open the case and push for a harsher sentence that eventually led to their imprisonment.

"Deadly air strike hits Syrian government-held Deir al-Zor: state TV, monitor","BEIRUT (Reuters) - An air raid in the government-held Qusur district of Deir al-Zor city in eastern Syria killed more than a dozen people, Syrian state television and a war monitor said on Monday.  State television said jets from a U.S.-led international coalition battling Islamic State carried out the air strike and that it killed 14 civilians and wounded 32 others.  A spokesman for the coalition said on Tuesday it had not carried out such a raid, and that its only strike in the vicinity in recent weeks took place in September across the Euphrates from the city. The war monitor, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported that it was not known which aircraft carried out the strike, but that at least 22 people were killed.  The Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran and Shi ite militias, is fighting Islamic State in the city of Deir al-Zor, as well as in parts of the surrounding countryside. Both Syrian and Russian jets have been hitting Islamic State in that area.  The U.S.-backed coalition has been conducting air strikes against Islamic State in support of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias to the east of Deir al-Zor across the Euphrates.  The rival U.S.-backed and Syrian army offensives against Islamic State have clashed several times over recent months as they have pushed the jihadists from territory in eastern Syria.  The U.S. and Russia have said they communicate with each other to prevent possible points of conflict of violence between the two offensives.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
India drags feet on GM mustard permit amid powerful opposition,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has frozen requests to commercially release a locally developed genetically modified mustard, an environment ministry document released on Tuesday showed, amid stiff opposition to lab-altered food from domestic activists and politicians. The mustard variety would have been the first transgenic food crop to be allowed for commercial cultivation. But the environment ministry's Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has deferred approval despite a panel the ministry supervises giving the genetically modified (GM) mustard technical clearance last year. (bit.ly/2cnUOkZ) ""Subsequent to receipt of various representations from different stakeholders, matters related to environmental release of transgenic mustard are kept pending for further review,"" the GEAC said in minutes of a meeting released on the environment ministry's website marked ""confidential and restricted circulation"". (bit.ly/2yJrRLU) Cotton is the only GM crop currently allowed to be sold in the world s second most populous country where arable land is shrinking. U.S. company Monsanto Co dominates the cotton seed market in India, and often faces resistance from local companies over its position. The environment ministry told parliament on July 31 that GM mustard had been recommended by GEAC to it for ""consideration for environmental release and cultivation"". (bit.ly/2gCNc54) An environment ministry spokesman directed Reuters to GEAC head Amita Prasad, whose office said she was not available. Another GEAC official named on the ministry s website, Madhumita Biswas, did not respond to requests for comment. The decision on the mustard represents a setback for Deepak Pental and his colleagues at the Delhi University, who worked on developing and testing the variety for years. Pental, who earlier acknowledged that getting a go-ahead for GM food would be difficult, declined to comment on Tuesday. GM food has been opposed by activists and politicians in India due to fears that it could compromise food safety and biodiversity. Some experts have also questioned claims that GM crops are more productive than normal varieties. Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh - Hindi for ""national volunteer organization"" and the ideological parent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party - also opposes GM food and instead wants to promote local varieties. (reut.rs/2y1iytL) Even the previous government, led by the current opposition Congress party, in 2010 placed a moratorium on GM eggplant, also after an experts panel had given its clearance - effectively bringing the regulatory system to a deadlock before Modi revived it.

Unlikely allies eye vote to legalize cannabis in New Zealand,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand could become the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalize cannabis for personal use after an unlikely alliance of populist, centrist and leftist parties put drug policy immediately on the agenda of the incoming government. Recreational marijuana use is legal in several U.S. states and European nations including the Netherlands and Spain, but countries in the Asia-Pacific tend to have strict prohibitions. Australia recently introduced laws freeing up access to cannabis for medicinal use, but does not allow recreational use. Labour s prime minister-designate Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday she agreed with a Greens proposal for a referendum to legalize use of recreational cannabis.   We agreed that what we are doing now simply isn t working, so we have said yes to having that referendum,  Ardern told reporters in Wellington. There is no timeframe for possible legalization, which would represent the first major reform of drug laws since the 1970s, but would depend on the public first voting to back reforms.      Anything that helps shift New Zealand drug laws out of the dinosaur age is going to be a good thing,  Ross Bell, executive director of the charitable NZ Drug Foundation, told Reuters.   Arguably it is better for the sustainability of the reform to have a broad church like we ve got with this government, so that it is not just seen as some sort of fringe liberal policy,  Bell said in a telephone interview. Drug law reforms figured in talks to form New Zealand s new government after a Sept. 23 election failed to yield a majority for either the governing National Party or opposition Labour, although neither major party had such a campaign plank. The center-left Labour will govern with support from its new junior coalition member, the populist NZ First, which supports holding referendums on controversial issues. The Greens have offered  confidence and supply  and the diverse group of parties is already starting to deliver a melange of policies, from potential relaxation of drug laws to tighter immigration controls. New Zealand s drug use ranks among the world s highest, a study by the NZ Drug Foundation shows. Too much money is spent on enforcement and convictions, rather than on health policies, says the body, which gets government and private funding. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
U.S. coalition denies deadly strike in Syria's Deir al-Zor city,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition on Tuesday denied striking Deir al-Zor city in eastern Syria after Damascus accused its jets of killing more than a dozen people.  Syrian state television had said the U.S.-led coalition hit the government-held Qusur district, killing 14 civilians and wounding 32, on Monday.  The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was unclear which aircraft carried out the raid, but that it killed at least 22 people. Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, said on Tuesday that its jets had not conducted air strikes on any part of the eastern city. The coalition says it investigates any such allegations and is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and neighboring Iraq.  The Syrian army controls much of Deir al-Zor city, after pushing into it last month with the help of Russian air strikes and Iran-backed militias. That advance broke an Islamic State siege of an enclave there which had lasted nearly three years. Syrian troops and allied forces are now fighting Islamic State militants in a few remaining districts of the city, and in nearby parts of Deir al-Zor province. The U.S.-led coalition has been striking Islamic State targets to back an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias in other parts of the province across the Euphrates river. The United States and Russia have said they communicate with each other to prevent possible points of conflict between the two separate offensives. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

Najib will aim to win over voters in last budget before elections,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak will aim to reduce unhappiness over rising costs of living when he unveils his 2018 budget on Friday, ahead of an election that must be held within 10 months. Prices rose sharply in Malaysia - where household debt is among the highest in Asia - after Najib cut subsidies and in 2015 imposed a broad-based consumption tax, denting his popularity.  The leader also faces a political challenge from his mentor-turned-foe, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who called Najib a thief in connection with a scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Najib has denied any wrongdoing. Najib will bank on the new budget to shore up support before his five-year tenure ends in June. Given the coming election,  it will be more surprising if he announces something not people friendly,  said Brian Tan, a Singapore-based economist with Nomura. Stronger global commodity prices have aided the oil-dependent economy and given Najib some room to boost spending. But progress in narrowing the fiscal deficit - expected at 3 percent this year compared with 6 percent in 2009 - would plateau next year if the government focuses on pre-election spending, said Moody s analyst Anushka Shah.  It depends on what they do... whether they spend it on handouts and be seen as more populist or whether they save it, in which case we should see a reduction in the deficit,  Shah said. Most economists expect the new budget s fiscal deficit target will be slightly below 3.0 percent.  Any widening of the deficit would disappoint foreign investors. They have gradually returned to Southeast Asia s third largest economy as the ringgit currency, after a tumultuous period, strengthened 6 percent against the dollar this year. Najib, who has pushed a pro-business stance since becoming premier in 2009, dismantled decades-old fuel subsidies after narrowly winning the 2013 elections, to stave off the threat of a sovereign rating downgrade. To bolster government revenue in 2018, Najib will likely broaden the scope of the goods and services tax imposed in 2015 to include e-commerce transactions, though he is unlikely to change the 6 percent rate. The extra revenue is expected to fund  goodies  for Malaysia s 1.6 million civil servants - a key vote bank for his Barisan Nasional (BN) ruling coalition - to mitigate the strain from pricier goods and services. Civil servants saw a salary hike between 7 and 13 percent in 2012, ahead of the 2013 polls. But the recent sharp price increases may be eroding support among them. The opposition naturally anticipates that the coming budget will have handouts to help the BN win votes in the election.  Malaysians can expect many goodies... budgets are one of the political tools for Barisan Nasional to prepare them for general election,  said Kerk Chee Yee of the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP).  Najib, who is also finance minister, has already rolled out billions of ringgit worth of handouts for palm plantation settlers and armed forces veterans, and affordable housing projects, new schools and hospitals across the country.  We have to ensure quality of life of Malaysians (by) introducing more affordable housing, steady level of income growth, managing cost of living and certain initiatives that can supplement income,  Najib said on the government s official budget website. He is likely to maintain cash handouts to low income earners, provide tax breaks for middle income earners and expand policies to provide affordable housing.

"Factbox: Malaysia 2018 budget seen lifting cash aid, making GST change","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia s Prime Minister Najib Razak presents the government s 2018 budget on Oct. 27. Below are some items that it could feature, according to analysts  research notes and Malaysian media reports. OCBC Bank expects another year of cash handouts, estimating that the allocation will rise to 7.5 billion ringgit ($1.78 billion) from the 6.8 billion ringgit spent in 2017. The government may consider expanding the scope of the goods and services tax, which was introduced at 6 percent in April 2015, to cover e-commerce transactions, according to a note by UOB. Middle income earners could get tax breaks as Najib looks to soften the blow from rising living costs, according to Nomura economist Brian Tan. The last time the government announced tax cuts was 2014. Najib has said that civil servants can expect  good news  in the 2018 budget. Salaries were last raised between 7 and 13 percent in 2012, and in July 2016 the minimum wage was raised from 832 ringgit to 1,200 ringgit, according to data from HSBC. The government announced in April that minimum wage will be reviewed for a possible adjustment in 2018. The current rate is 1,000 ringgit in the peninsula and 920 ringgit in Sabah and Sarawak. The government is expected to raise its allocation to develop affordable housing for 2018. In this year s budget, 700 million ringgit was allocated to build affordable options such as Rent-To-Own schemes offering properties for as low as 35,000 ringgit to low-income earners.

Canada's Liberals win Quebec seat in sign of pre-election strength,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada s ruling Liberals won a special election in Quebec on Monday, picking up a parliamentary seat in a province where insiders say the party needs to do better if it is to retain power in a 2019 federal election. Provisional results showed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s Liberals won the constituency of Lac-Saint-Jean with about 36 percent of the vote, with the separatist Bloc Quebecois in second place and the opposition Conservatives close behind in third. The Conservatives had held the seat before the sitting legislator retired earlier this year. The Liberals, who now hold 41 of Quebec s 78 seats, privately say they need to win another 12 in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere and maintain their majority in the House of Commons in an election in October 2019. Quebec polls show the party far ahead of the Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois in province-wide support. National opinion surveys though show Trudeau s government is slipping in popularity amid an alleged conflict-of-interest problem involving Finance Minister Bill Morneau. Provisional results also showed the Conservatives easily retaining the seat of Sturgeon River-Parkland in the western province of Alberta, the party s stronghold. ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
"Trump to press China on North Korea, trade on Beijing visit","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to pressure North Korea when he visits China next month, a senior White House official said on Monday, stepping up a strategy to have Beijing help rein in Pyongyang. Isolating North Korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for Trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date. Trump will call on Xi to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang and take other steps to pressure North Korea.  China, North Korea s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. China has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North.      But a senior White House official who briefed reporters ahead of Trump s trip said China needs to do more to comply with two U.N. Security Council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with China s support.  We would like to see China follow through on those commitments. We would like to see China do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those U.N. Security Council resolutions,  the official said. Though China has been angered by North Korea s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region. South Korea, the United States and Japan started a two-day missile tracking drill on Tuesday, South Korea s military said in a statement, in preparation for any missile or nuclear threats from North Korea. The exercises will be held in waters off the coasts of South Korea and Japan, South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, with four Aegis combat system-equipped ships from all three countries participating in the drill. China s special envoy for the North Korea nuclear issue, Kong Xuanyou, met his U.S. counterpart, Joseph Yun, in Beijing on Monday, China s Foreign Ministry said, where they had a  deep exchange of views on the Korean peninsula issue . The ministry did not elaborate. Trump, who has threatened to  totally destroy  North Korea, has frequently asked China to help rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But this strategy has so far failed to stop Pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the Pacific Ocean over Japan. The threat from North Korea has grown to a  critical and imminent level  and the United States, Japan and South Korea must address the matter, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told his U.S. and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday. Onodera s remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo about North Korean weapons tests as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States. The White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the North Korea standoff. Asked by reporters whether an offer by former President Jimmy Carter to serve as a U.S. envoy to North Korea would be accepted, the official said:  There s nothing planned.  Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday he outlined for Trump his country s efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program but also advised the U.S. leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict.  There is no quick and easy solution. Pressure is necessary but so is dialogue. The U.S. will need to work with others, including China, South Korea and Japan and Russia to resolve the issue,  he said. With Xi consolidating power in the wake of a Communist Party Congress in Beijing, Trump believes the Chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against North Korea, senior administration officials said last week. Trump s Nov. 3-14 trip will include visits to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Trump will also be tough on trade during talks with Xi as he seeks to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, the White House official said.  We have huge barriers that Americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the Chinese market. The president is intent on rectifying that situation,  the official said.    Despite Trump s fierce criticism of China s trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with Beijing on North Korea. China has insisted it is doing all it can, and some Chinese diplomats say the Trump administration has overestimated how much influence Beijing has over its defiant neighbor. Even as China has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to U.S. demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the United States to negotiate with Pyongyang.

"Venezuela governors sworn in, showing opposition disunity","CARACAS (Reuters) - In another setback for Venezuela s dispirited opposition, four of its five state governors broke with their coalition s official stance on Monday to swear themselves in before a pro-government legislative superbody. The Democratic Unity coalition went into the Oct. 15 gubernatorial polls as favorites for a big win against President Nicolas Maduro s candidates because of voter anger at a brutal economic crisis in the OPEC member. But it ended up taking just five of 23 states. Initially alleging fraud, the opposition later acknowledged that abstentionism in its ranks played a big part in the defeat, which shed doubt on its ability to beat the ruling socialists in next year s presidential vote. After the regional ballot, the coalition said none of its winning candidates would  kneel  before the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly body, which it has refused to recognize since its establishment in an election in July.   But the newly elected governors for Tachira, Merida, Nuevo Esparta and Anzoategui - all from the Democratic Action party, one of Venezuela s biggest and oldest - swore themselves in before assembly directors as a prerequisite to taking office. After presiding over the ceremony, Constituent Assembly head Delcy Rodriguez chided the one winning opposition candidate, Juan Pablo Guanipa of oil-rich Zulia state, who held out.  These actions will have consequences,  she said. Maduro previously warned there may be a new election in any state where the winner does not swear loyalty to the assembly. Guanipa, of the Justice First party, which has a militant line against Maduro, said he would not legitimize the  fraudulent  Constituent Assembly whose election the opposition boycotted.  Zulia will never kneel before the dictatorship,  he added. Critics see the creation of the Constituent Assembly, which has superseded all powers including the opposition-led congress, as the cementing of dictatorship in Venezuela. Major Western and Latin American nations have refused to recognize its legitimacy. But Maduro said it was the only way to bring peace back after four months of opposition protests this year that led to 125 deaths, thousands of arrests and injuries, and widespread damage to property and infrastructure. Appearing on state TV late on Monday, Maduro said he had congratulated the four Democratic Action governors by telephone and would meet with them, possibly as soon as Tuesday.   I ve told them:  Let s turn the page ... and get down to work,  he said. Democratic Action is one of the biggest parties in the opposition coalition, and its decision on Monday infuriated many opposition supporters who viewed it as a sellout. The move could presage a complete reformulation, or possible breakup, of the coalition, which consists of more than two dozen parties and has long suffered from infighting.  We are going to see a new unity. In the worst crises and circumstances, opportunities always crop up,  wrote opposition leader Henrique Capriles, of the Justice First party, hinting at imminent changes.    The coalition s biggest triumph was a resounding victory at December 2015 legislative elections. But it has been in the doldrums since Maduro survived this year s protests, and many Venezuelans perceive its leaders as elitist.  Further pummeling his foes, Maduro named five senior officials as  protectors  for the states won by the opposition, undermining its influence on the ground by granting new funding and parallel responsibilities to government figures there.

India's Gandhi scion seeks revival in PM Modi's backyard,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Rahul Gandhi, the scion of India s most fabled political dynasty, will within weeks be crowned leader of the Congress party, handing him a freer rein to prove if he can mount a credible challenge to the dominance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The great-grandson of India s founding prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, has struggled to convince voters - and many in his party - that he is leadership material, especially after a drubbing in the 2014 general election.  Modi s depiction of the 47-year-old as an undeserving  prince  has helped sideline Gandhi since the last national vote, during which time Congress has suffered some of its worst ever local election results. But this year the economy has stumbled, and Congress politicians hope a round of state elections, beginning in Modi s home state of Gujarat, offer them - and their leader - a shot at revival ahead of the next national poll in 2019. Gandhi will soon take over as Congress president from his 70-year-old mother, Sonia Gandhi, a symbolic promotion that three Congress officials said they hoped would free his hand to shift the narrative from a clash of personalities - which Modi has so far resoundingly won - to a debate about policies.  You will see many changes and every change will be a reaffirmation of what Congress s core beliefs are,  said party MP and senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, who works closely with Rahul Gandhi.  The right time has come to strike a chord with the masses against Modi s governance style, and we will not miss it.  Congress insiders acknowledge their leader has sometimes made it easy for Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to question his commitment to politics.  The key problem with Rahul Gandhi has been his lack of consistency,  said a senior party figure, who declined to be identified.  He frequently takes a break after few roadshows and it is this inconsistency that has been a huge issue.  But Congress officials say Gandhi has recently been finding his stride criticizing Modi for failing to create jobs, while the party has won a handful of recent by-elections.  Gandhi is traversing Gujarat, the western state where Modi made his name, to fire up his party workers.  He has ditched some of the party rallies for one-on-one meetings with trade unions, dairy workers and small traders - a traditional Modi powerbase that has been hit hard by recent economic reforms championed by the prime minister.  Modi has taken notice. Last week he told workers from his Hindu nationalist BJP that the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty would  destroy Gujarat . His party president, recently dispatched to the Gandhi family heartland in northern India, said this month that Gandhi needed to swap his  Italian  glasses for  Gujarati  spectacles to see the economic development the BJP had brought to the region, in a jibe at his Italian-born mother s roots.  BJP would love it to be a war of personalities. Congress has to frame it as a war of two different approaches, even ideologies,  said Sandeep Shastri, a political scientist and Congress expert at Jain University.  Gandhi, who rarely talks to the media, declined a Reuters interview request.   Rahul s father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all prime ministers in post-independence India. But critics deride Gandhi as a political lightweight who depends on his family name for power. Bursts of political energy have been followed by lengthy absences. In 2015 he took nearly two months of leave, prompting Modi s party to accuse him of  holidaying  while parliament was in session.  Congress now governs states home to less than 10 percent of India s 1.3 billion population, its powerbase shriveled under the onslaught of Modi s popularity. Congress insiders acknowledge the party is unlikely to win the December election in Gujarat, but cutting into the BJP majority in the state would send a powerful signal that Congress under Gandhi has a fighting chance against a still-popular Modi. Gandhi has set up a new social media team in New Delhi to work on his image, and officials say he has been forging better ties with regional parties that are often key powerbrokers in India politics. On a recent tour of Gujarat, Gandhi reached out to the frustrations of the state s powerful business community with a new tax regime, including small traders such as those selling dry fruits. Different tax rates on almonds and cashews, imposed under a new national sales tax Modi s government launched in July, had left traders confused and damaged sales during the peak festival season.  We have to show him as the face of the party before Gujarat elections,  said a close aide, who declined to be named.  BJP leaders say they are untroubled, and that any small bounce in Gandhi s standing will die down once the economy strengthens. Modi has called the slowdown a blip.  What does his claim to fame rest on?,  said Nalin Kohli, a national spokesman for the BJP.  Two months of campaigning does not make him an active politician.   ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1

U.N. says Sri Lanka's delay in post-war reconciliation involves risks,"COLOMBO (Reuters) - Long delays in Sri Lanka s post-war reconciliation is not without cost, and its government should implement measures to resolve outstanding issues, the United Nations said on Monday.  President Maithripala Sirisena s government in 2015 agreed with the U.N. to investigate alleged war crimes in the final phase of a 26-year civil war. It then requested a two-year extension to fulfill that commitment. Both sides in the conflict - the government military and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - were equally responsible for war crimes, according to the U.N. The government has agreed to establish a special court to investigate the alleged crimes and return land occupied by the military in the north.  However, much of the process has been delayed by the government amid worries it will lose popularity among Sinhala Buddhists, Sri Lanka s majority community, analysts say.  After a two-week fact-finding mission, U.N. special rapporteur Pablo de Greiff said such delays raise questions about the determination of the government to undertake a comprehensive transitional justice program.   Long delays between the acknowledgment of obligations to establish transitional justice measures and the fulfillment of these involves risks: no one should be under the impression that waiting is a costless alternative,  he told reporters in Colombo after concluding his mission. He also said the process has been increasingly ethnicized.   As a result, transitional justice is represented as if it were essentially a threat to the majority community, of interest to one of the minorities only   and all others left at the margins,  he said. Many Sri Lankans oppose foreign involvement, and supporters of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa believe the U.N. resolution on the need to investigate war crimes aims to punish the military unfairly. The international community has urged a judicial process to hold out a realistic prospect of punishment for senior figures in Rajapaksa s government and military, as well as Tamil Tiger rebels, who waged a bitter final battle in which the U.N. has said up to 40,000 people were killed.

But Myanmar continued to issue  propaganda projecting Rohingyas as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh , Ahsan said, adding:  This blatant denial of the ethnic identity of Rohingyas remains a stumbling block.  Myanmar considers the Rohingya to be stateless, although they trace their presence in the country back generations. Filippo Grandi, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, later told journalists that the two countries had begun talks on  repatriation . Conducive conditions have to be  recreated  in Rakhine, he said.  This must include a solution to the question of citizenship, or rather lack thereof for the Rohingya community,  Grandi said. Khaled al-Jarallah, deputy foreign minister of Kuwait, called on Myanmar authorities to  cease the practice of stripping the Rohingya minority of their right of citizenship, which as a result deprives them of the right to property and employment . Jordan s Queen Rania visited Rohingya refugee camps on Monday and called for a stronger response from the international community to the plight of the Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh to escape  systematic persecution  in Myanmar.   One has to ask, why is the plight of this Muslim minority group being ignored? Why has the systematic prosecution been allowed to play out for so long?  she asked after touring the camps. The United Nations has appealed for $434 million to provide life-saving aid to 1.2 million people for six months. A total of $344 million has been raised so far, a final U.N. statement said.  We need more money to keep pace with intensifying needs. This is not an isolated crisis, it is the latest round in a decades-long cycle of persecution, violence and displacement,  U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told the talks. An estimated 1,000-3,000 Rohingya still enter Bangladesh daily, William Lacy Swing, head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. He called them:  these most rejected and vulnerable people in the world.  Joanne Liu, president of the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) or Doctors Without Borders, described them as  the walking dead .  There are only 210 hospital beds for 1 million refugees, malnutrition is on the rise and latrines are lacking to prevent contamination, she said.  The camp is a time-bomb, ticking towards a full-blown health crisis.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
China court uses social media to shame debtors: China Daily,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A local court in the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou is using social media to shame people into repaying their debts, the China Daily reported on Tuesday. Citizens who ignore court repayment orders have been subjected to targeted advertisements on the popular Chinese social media app WeChat, notifying their contacts about the amount of money they owe, the paper said. It said the court in Wenzhou s Ouhai district had released the names and photos of 20 local defaulters owing a total of 10.7 million yuan ($1.61 million). Though China has sought to make more credit available to individuals in a bid to develop a consumer economy, officials have expressed concern about surging levels of household debt, which is estimated to have doubled in less than a decade to reach around 50 percent of gross domestic product.  China s outstanding household consumer loans surged nearly 30 percent by the end of September from a year earlier, and the country s central bank governor recently issued a strong warning about the risks of rapidly rising debt. With no reliable nationwide credit rating system, authorities across the country are looking for ways to crack down on people who fail to repay.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Brazil seeks to revoke asylum of Italian ex-guerrilla convicted of murder,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian government told the Supreme Court on Monday that President Michel Temer has the authority to revoke the asylum status a former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in Italy and extradite him at his country s request. Cesare Battisti committed four murders in the 1970s when he belonged to a guerilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism, according to the Italian government. He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited to Italy. Brazil s Supreme Court authorized Battisti s extradition in 2009, but he was not sent back to Italy because former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva granted him refugee status on his last day in office in 2010. In a note to the top court, the government s chief lawyer Grace Mendon a argued that extradition was a political decision that only the president could make.  She reminded the court that it had approved Battisti s extradition in 2009 and asked the justices to reject a habeas corpus writ issued ten days ago by one of its members. Battisti was arrested on Oct. 4 as he tried to cross the border into Bolivia in a taxi, apparently fearing that Brazil s government was about to revoke his asylum status at Italy s request. He was freed two days later. Lula s refusal to extradite Battisti upset relations between Brazil and Italy. Temer, a center-right president who took office when Lula s handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached last year, decided it was time to remove that thorn.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1
Politically charged murder trial of Mexican immigrant starts in San Francisco,"(Reuters) - The trial of a Mexican man accused of murdering a woman while illegally in the United States began in San Francisco on Monday, a case that President Donald Trump has cited as an example of the dangers posed by lax border security. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, also known as Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, has said he shot Kate Steinle by accident on a pier in the California city on July 1, 2015. He has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, a charge that can bring between 15 years to life in prison. Court officials confirmed the trial had started but did not offer further details of the proceedings.   He did not know the object in his hand was a gun,  Matt Gonzalez, an attorney for the defendant, was quoted as saying by NBC Bay Area before he headed into the courtroom.  He does not bear criminal responsibility.  Assistant District Attorney Diana Garcia declined to comment on the case. Prosecutors have accused the defendant of recklessly pointing a stolen gun at people on the pier. Prosecutors and defense attorneys were in court and not immediately available for comment. Garcia Zarate had been deported to Mexico five times since first entering the United States as a juvenile, the San Francisco Chronicle and other local media reported.  Steinle has been frequently invoked by name by Trump as part of his signature pledges to halt illegal immigration and crack down on so-called  sanctuary cities  that refuse to comply with certain federal immigration laws. In June, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 228-195 to pass the  No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,  which would withhold some federal grants to sanctuary cities. By a vote of 257-167, the chamber also passed  Kate s law,  named for Kate Steinle, to increase penalties for illegal immigrants who return to the United States. Under the laws, immigrants in the country illegally would face mandatory detention for past convictions of an expanded number of offenses. San Francisco, like other sanctuary jurisdictions, has defended its approach as making the city safer, saying its practice of not inquiring about immigration status makes immigrants, including those in the country illegally, more willing to report crimes.

Liberia party submits complaint over alleged vote fraud,"DAKAR (Reuters) - The Liberty Party that placed third in the first round of Liberia s presidential elections on Monday submitted a complaint to the elections commission (NEC), calling for it to annul the result won by former soccer star George Weah, the document showed. If the contents of the Liberty Party (LP) complaint, which was seen by Reuters, are deemed valid, it could force a re-run of what is expected to be the West African country s first democratic transfer of power since 1944. Its candidate lawyer Charles Brumskine placed third after Weah placed first and the ruling party s Joseph Boakai second. The complaint was filed by the presidential and vice-presidential candidates as well as all representative candidates of the Liberty Party. International observers, including The Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute, said they did not see any major problems with the vote. In its complaint, the Liberty Party alleges various problems ranging from the late opening of polls to the absence of queue controllers but also included fraud allegations, including by NEC officials.  NEC officials were not immediately available outside of normal office hours.  In one case, the LP alleges that an NEC officer had pre-marked ballots in his possession. In another, the LP said an official misrepresented the number of ballots for the party s candidate.  These elections were characterized by gross irregularities and fraud, which undermined the integrity of the elections and deprived thousands of Liberians of their constitutional right to vote,  the document said. The second round run-off is scheduled for next month. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Most EU states push reform of labor rules sought by France's Macron,"LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Most European Union states agreed on Monday on reforming the bloc s labor rules that poorer countries value for giving them a competitive edge but French President Emmanuel Macron criticizes for undercutting his workers. The issue of the so-called posted workers pits wealthier countries against poorer peers keen to preserve current rules that allow their citizens to work elsewhere in the bloc for salaries higher than they would get at home but still lower than the local labor force. Macron has put reforming the so-called posting of workers directive high on the EU s agenda and is backed by Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, among others. After some 12 hours of negotiations among labor ministers in Luxembourg, most of the EU s 28 members backed a compromise that would cap posting workers abroad at 18 months and introduce a four-year transition between reaching a final agreement on the reform and its taking effect. Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland said they could not back the proposal, while Ireland, Britain and Croatia abstained over concerns that the new rules would hurt their transport industries.  Europe is moving forward, I salute the ambitious agreement on posted workers: more protection, less fraud,  Macron said in a post on Twitter late on Monday.  The Dutch minister praised the deal, saying all workers deserved protection from unfair competition. His Hungarian colleague said the final text was vague and left too much scope for interpretation. Most EU countries were taking the floor on the matter throughout the day of negotiations on the politically sensitive reform, with one key point of contention being whether to keep international road transport covered by any new posting rules, as sought by Berlin and Paris among others.  Spain, Ireland, Portugal and several states on the EU s eastern flank wanted that exempted and subject to a separate law. In the latter group, Poland is the biggest exporter of cheap labor force in the EU.  The bloc s executive Commission in the end declared that part of the transport sector, namely transit, would not be regulated by the posting rules.   The transport sector is a special case because of the industry s mobile nature, (and) there are several texts on the sector being discussed which will detail exactly how it will be applied,  an official at the French president s office said.      While one camp says cheap workers  easy access to their countries is weighing on salaries and undermining the labor market, the other says tightening rules amounts to protectionism and weakens competition.  It s about fairness on the labor market,  said the EU s top jobs official, Marianne Thyssen.  I am all in favor of freedom of movement but it must be organized in a fair way ... The internal market is based on rules, it s not a jungle.  Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and other easterners say they should be allowed to compete with lower wages to catch up with the wealthier west after decades of communist malaise. Macron embarked on a tour of eastern Europe over the summer as he tries to get countries on board, and some such as Bulgaria and Slovakia backed the agreement.   The 18-month agreement   written down as a 12-month cap with a possible 6-month extension   bridged most differences over the maximum period allowed for sending workers abroad under posting rules before they fall under the host country s labor laws. The ministers gave a green light to opening negotiations on the reform with the European Parliament, which will likely bring more changes to any final agreement.  Apart from the future of transport, other themes still open include exact remuneration rules for the posting of workers, which is profitable for companies because of the wage gap in the EU.  While the estimated 2 million posted workers only make up a tiny fraction of the bloc s workforce, the issue has driven a wedge between the richer states at the center and their poorer peers on the peripheries. For Macron, the reform is seen as crucial to convince his voters of a need for difficult economic reforms at home by showing he stands up for their interests in the EU.  European lawmakers last week agreed their own stance on the matter, including by proposing a 24-month limit on working abroad under posting rules, and ensuring that such mobile workers are entitled to the same bonuses as the locals.

Morocco arrests six suspected Islamic State militants,"RABAT (Reuters) - Moroccan authorities said on Monday they had arrested six suspected Islamic State militants who had been planning attacks. The arrested belonged to a group linked to Islamic State that was dismantled this month which had been active in eight towns and cities and which had planned terrorist operations, an official statement said. One of the six arrested was an expert in explosives, the statement said. Eleven other militants had already been arrested earlier this month. Moroccan authorities say they have dismantled dozens of jihadist cells since 2002, including about 50 with alleged links to Islamic State.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Austrian conservative Kurz says needs more time on coalition,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz said on Monday he needs more time to decide which party he will hold coalition talks with but did nothing to dampen expectations that he will turn to the far right. Kurz s People s Party (OVP) won last week s parliamentary election with 31.5 percent of the vote, well short of a majority, which means it needs a partner to form a stable government. He had been expected to announce which party he would be inviting to coalition talks on Monday after spending the weekend talking with the leaders of all parties entering the new parliament.  It has yet to be decided with whom we want to start negotiations. I will clarify that in the coming hours or days,  Kurz said after meeting President Alexander Van der Bellen.   There are certain issues that I would like to discuss again informally or clear up before I start negotiations,  he told reporters, declining to elaborate. European leaders have expressed guarded concern about the possible return to power of the Freedom Party (FPO), which was founded in the 1950s by ex-Nazis and was last in government more than a decade ago. The FPO once argued against membership in the European Union but has become steadily more mainstream, dropping those calls and expelling members for anti-Semitic statements.      Kurz, who is just 31, has maintained that any future government will be pro-European. But he campaigned on an anti-immigration platform that was very similar to the FPO s, after Europe s migration crisis left many voters feeling Austria was being overrun. Only two parties   the Social Democrats (SPO), who came second in the election, and the FPO, which came third   have enough seats to give Kurz a majority if they go into coalition with him. But a partnership between the two centrist parties has never been considered the most likely outcome, even though they have governed together for 44 of the 72 years since World War Two.  Kurz forced last week s election when he called an end to the current coalition with the SPO after he took over as OVP leader, and the two sides are now at loggerheads. The Social Democrats said on Monday they were planning on going into opposition. In principle, however, any tie-up between two of the top three parties could take place. And none of those options have been fully ruled out, including a  coalition of losers  between the FPO and Social Democrats. Kurz has also said a minority government is an option if coalition talks fail. The head of Austria s main Jewish group earlier on Monday warned Kurz not to do business with  the wolf  of the FPO.  When the nationalist wolf puts on a blue sheep skin it does not change its nature, only its appearance,  the head of Austria s main Jewish group, Oskar Deutsch, said in an open letter to both centrist parties. Blue is the colour of the FPO, which is staunchly anti-Islam but now openly courts Jewish voters, with limited success.  If OVP and SPO believe they can tame the wolf, they are deceiving themselves,  Deutsch said. The FPO s Davis Lasar, a Jewish lawmaker, responded by saying in a statement:  The FPO has always been committed to the safety of Austria s Jewish population.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
"UK certain Iran nuclear deal to be preserved, U.S. says remains committed","LONDON (Reuters) - There is absolutely no doubt that a deal between Western powers and Iran to curb its nuclear program will survive despite the U.S. decision not to recertify the deal, Britain s foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Monday. Johnson was giving a speech on foreign affairs in London. U.S. President Donald Trump broke ranks with other major powers earlier this month by refusing to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), even though international inspectors say it is. The U.S. Congress now has 60 days since Trump s action to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

Egypt authorities challenge Reuters on casualties in western desert attack,"LONDON (Reuters) - Egyptian authorities have accused Reuters and the BBC of inaccurate coverage of clashes in the western desert between security forces and armed militants in which police officers and conscripts were killed on Friday.  In a statement, Egypt s State Information Service (SIS) said Reuters had made  grave professional mistakes  by relying on unidentified security sources and not  resorting to official security authorities to get correct information .  The Ministry of Interior in an initial statement on Friday did not give any casualty figure for Friday s clashes. On Saturday, a ministry statement said 16 police and conscripts were killed and another 13 wounded in a remote western desert area after they came under heavy fire from the armed group.   However, three security sources told Reuters as many as 52 police had been killed in gun battles, which security sources said involved militants firing rockets at a police convoy.    We take seriously our obligation to report the news fairly and accurately, and were careful here to report both the Interior Ministry s account of the situation as well as information we received independently from other sources,  a Reuters spokesperson said.     The SIS also criticized the use of the word militant in the English version of the story that Reuters published.    Reuters English exchanged the term  terrorists , which is only accurate and realistic description of those elements, with the term  militants , a matter that may give a positive connotation to the reader,  the statement said. The BBC issued its own report on the Egyptian statement. here ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
"Nicaragua will join Paris climate pact, leaving U.S., Syria isolated","(Reuters) - Nicaragua is set to join the Paris climate agreement, according to an official statement and comments from Vice President Rosario Murillo on Monday, in a move that leaves the United States and Syria as the only nations outside the global pact. Nicaragua has already presented the relevant documents at the United Nations, Murillo, who is also first lady, said on local radio on Monday.   It is the only instrument we have in the world that allows the unity of intentions and efforts to face up to climate change and natural disasters,  Murillo said.  U.S. President Donald Trump said in June he would withdraw the United States from the accord, and Nicaragua s decision to enter the pact means only two countries will now be outside it - the world s No. 1 economy and war-torn Syria. Nicaragua, a poor Central American nation that is often threatened by hurricanes, was the only nation to reject the agreement in 2015, and has argued for far more drastic action to limit rising temperatures. The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries two years ago, seeks to limit planetary warming by curbing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists believe drive global warming. The administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama had pledged deep emissions cuts as part of the deal, but his successor, Trump, has said the accord would cost America trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and hinder the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries. Island nation Fiji will host the next round of U.N. climate talks from Nov. 6-17 in Bonn, Germany, where environment ministers from around the world will work on a set of international guidelines for the Paris accord. The latest round of negotiations take place after a string of powerful hurricanes ravaged Caribbean island nations and caused billions of dollars in damage along the Texas and Florida coastlines. Climate scientists have said warmer air and water resulting from climate change may have contributed to the severity of the storms. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has disputed such claims as an attempt to  politicize  natural disasters. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
"U.S. mulls South Sudan pressure, cutting aid may not work: U.N. envoy","ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The United States is considering how to pressure South Sudan s President Salva Kiir into peace, but withdrawing aid may not work, U.S. envoy to the United Nations Nikki Haley said ahead of a visit to South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia on Tuesday.  Haley plans to visit Gambella in western Ethiopia, where nearly 350,000 refugees have flooded across the border from South Sudan since the country spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after it gained independence from Sudan.   You have to really think hard before you pull U.S. aid because President Kiir doesn t care,  Haley said.  He doesn t care if his people suffer and that s the concern we have as we don t know that will make a difference.   That s a conversation we will have and we will try and see exactly what will move President Kiir so that he does ... start to really look at creating a safe position for his people,  she told reporters in Addis Ababa late on Monday. Haley will this week be the most senior member of U.S. President Donald Trump s administration to visit South Sudan, where she is due to meet with Kiir. But first, she will see how the conflict has threatened to spillover through deadly cross-border raids into Gambella, Ethiopia by gunmen from South Sudan.  Trump s new aid administrator, Mark Green, visited South Sudan last month, telling Kiir that Washington was reviewing its policy toward his government. He called on Kiir to end the violence and implement a  real  ceasefire.  The war in South Sudan was sparked by a feud between Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar. It has plunged parts of the world s youngest nation into famine and forced a third of the population - some 4 million people - to flee their homes. Machar fled and is now being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.  A fragile peace deal broke down last year amid gun battles between soldiers and rebels in the capital Juba. International efforts to bring warring sides to new talks have not succeeded.  We can t see any more deaths, we can t see anymore famine, we ve got to start seeing the situation start to get better and I think that the pressure is only going to continue until President Kiir makes a difference,  Haley said.  The Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief for their role in the conflict, atrocities against civilians and attacks against international missions in South Sudan.

"Spanish tourist shot, killed by police in Rio de Janeiro slum","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Police shot and killed a Spanish tourist in a Rio de Janeiro slum on Monday after the car she was riding in failed to stop at a police road block, authorities said.  Rio s police confirmed in a written statement that Maria Esperanza Ruiz Jimenez, 67, died after being shot by a police officer in the Rocinha slum.  The Rio state security secretariat, which oversees all police forces, said the shooting would be investigated.  Rocinha has been the scene of severe violence for a month as rival gangs have clashed with each other for control over the drug trade. Intense shootouts between the gangs and also with police have taken place almost daily. Several other slums in the city that hosted the 2016 Olympics have also seen increased shootouts.  For several months police have struggled to maintain control of the city. President Michel Temer in July authorized the use of about 9,000 army soldiers to help patrol Rio, but it has had little effect on tamping down the violence. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Abadi defends role of Iranian-backed paramiltaries at meeting with Tillerson,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi defended the role of an Iranian-backed paramilitary force at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday in Baghdad. Tillerson arrived on Monday hours after the Iraqi government rejected his call to send home the Popular Mobilisation, an Iran-backed force that helped defeat Islamic State and capture the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk. In his opening remarks at the meeting with Tillerson, Abadi said Popular Mobilisation  is part of the Iraqi institutions,  rejecting accusations that it is acting as an Iranian proxy.  Popular Mobilisation fighters should be encouraged because they will be the hope of country and the region,  he added.    Iraq is one of the few countries allied closely to both the United States and Iran, and Tillerson s effort to drive a wedge between Baghdad and Tehran appeared to have backfired, drawing a sharp statement from the prime minister s office. Tillerson visited Iraq a day after a rare joint meeting with Abadi and Saudi Arabia s King Salman in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. After that meeting, he called on Iraq to halt the work of the Tehran-backed paramilitary units, which have operated alongside government troops in battles against Islamic State and, since last week, in a lightning advance that seized the oil city of Kirkuk from Kurdish security forces. At his meeting with Abadi in Baghdad, Tillerson urged the Iraqi government and Masoud Barzani s Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil to resolve their conflict on Kurdish self-determination and disputed territories through dialogue.   We are concerned and a bit sad,  Tillerson said.  We have friends in Baghdad and friends in Erbil, and we encourage all parties to enter into discussion ... and all differences can be addressed.    Iraqi forces are deploying tanks and artillery just south of a Kurdish-operated oil pipeline that crosses into Turkey, a Kurdish security official said, the latest in a series of Iranian-backed operations against the Kurds.  Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close, those militias need to go home,  Tillerson said on Sunday in Saudi Arabia. Abadi s office responded sharply.  No party has the right to interfere in Iraqi matters,  a statement from his office read. It did not cite the prime minister himself but a  source  close to him. It referred to the mainly Shi ite Popular Mobilisation as  patriots . One of the closest groups to Iran within Popular Mobilisation, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, reacted to Tillerson s comment by saying it would be Americans who will be forced to leave Iraq.  Your forces should get ready to get out of our country once the excuse of Daesh s presence is over,  said Asaib s leader, Sheikh Qais al-Khazali, according to the group s TV channel, al-Aahd. The international battle against Islamic State fighters in northern Iraq since 2014 saw the United States and Iran effectively fighting on the same side, with both supporting the Iraqi government against the militants. Washington has 5,000 troops in Iraq and provided air support, training and weapons to Iraqi government forces. At the same time, Iran armed, trained and advised Shi ite paramilitaries that often fought alongside the army. The latest twist in the Iraq conflict, pitting the central government against the Kurds, is trickier for U.S. policymakers. Washington still supports the central government but has also been allied to the Kurds for decades. Iran is the pre-eminent Shi ite power in the Middle East. Shi ites, including Abadi, are the majority in Iraq, but it also has large Sunni Arab and Kurdish communities. In the campaign for the Kurdish referendum, Iran backed the government against the Kurds. Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards, repeatedly warned Kurdish leaders to withdraw from the oil city of Kirkuk or face an onslaught by Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed fighters, Kurdish officials briefed on the meetings said. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed Tillerson s remarks. The paramilitaries could not go home because  they are at home  already, he was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. Abadi has asserted his authority with the defeat of Islamic State in Mosul and the Iraqi army s sweep through Kirkuk and other areas that were held by the Kurds. The buildup at the Kurdish oil export pipeline is taking place northwest of Mosul, an official from the Kurdistan Regional Government s security council said. The loss of Kirkuk dealt a major blow to the Kurds, who had been steadily building an autonomous region in northern Iraq since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein, who oppressed them for decades.  We are concerned about continued military build-up of Iraqi forces and Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces towards the Kurdistan Region,  said the Kurdistan Region Security Council in a statement. Elections for the Iraqi Kurdistan region s presidency and parliament set for Nov. 1 will be delayed because political parties failed to present candidates, the head of the electoral commission, Hendrean Mohammed, told Reuters. Parties have been unable to focus on the elections in the turmoil that followed the referendum, a Kurdish lawmaker said on condition of anonymity. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
U.N. condemns arrests of Congo opposition members,"LUBUMBASHI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo on Monday condemned the arrest of about 30 opposition members amid a crackdown on dissent by President Joseph Kabila s government.  The arrests occurred in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi on Sunday when police broke up a meeting by the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party on the eve of a return to the city of opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi, party members told Reuters.     Such security incidents are threatening to spiral out of control in Africa s largest copper producer because of Kabila s refusal to hold elections when his presidential mandate expired nearly a year ago.  From now, we no longer consider Joseph Kabila as president,  Tshisekedi told journalists on Monday in Lubumbashi, where a planned rally was banned by the government. He is usually in the capital, or in Europe.  Congo s government has banned opposition demonstrations since last year, when security forces killed dozens of protesters demanding Kabila s departure.    The election commission said this month that an election to replace Kabila, who came to power after his father s assassination in 2001, would not be possible before April 2019 at the earliest - raising the prospect of long-term unrest.  I urge the Congolese authorities to release immediately and unconditionally those arbitrarily arrested yesterday in Lubumbashi,  said Maman Sidikou, head of the U.N. MONUSCO peacekeeping mission. MONUSCO also demanded an end to restrictions imposed on Kyungu wa Kumwanza, president of the National Union of Federalists of the Congo (UNAFEC) party, who has been under de facto house arrest for several months without being charged with a crime. In another sign of discontent with election delays, the Union for the Congolese Nation(UNC)opposition party said in a statement on Monday it was withdrawing its representative in a power-sharing government, Budget Minister Pierre Kangudia. The latter could not immediately be reached for comment. Kabila s political opponents are weak and divided. Many joined a power-sharing government earlier this year following the death of opposition figure, Etienne Tshisekedi, Felix s father, and they enjoy limited credibility with the population.  However, an economic crisis that has seen inflation spike to over 50 percent, increased militia activity, and a series of prison breaks have highlighted Kabila s tenuous hold on power.

Macri's coalition sweeps Argentina's mid-term vote,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Candidates allied with Argentine President Mauricio Macri enjoyed sweeping victories in Sunday s mid-term election, strengthening his position in Congress while dimming prospects for a political comeback by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez. A free-spending populist who nearly bankrupted the country during her 2007-2015 rule, Fernandez came in a distant second in her race for the Senate representing Buenos Aires, Argentina s most populous province. With 98 percent of ballots counted by the interior ministry, Macri s former education minister, Esteban Bullrich, had 41.34 percent versus 37.27 percent for Fernandez in the province that is home to nearly 40 percent of Argentine voters. Macri s  Cambiemos  or  Let s Change  coalition won the top five population centers of Buenos Aires City, and Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Santa Fe and Mendoza provinces. No single party had won all five in a mid-term vote since 1985.  Today the change elected in 2015 has been consolidated,  Vice President Gabriela Michetti told voters.  The election results, largely in line with pre-vote opinion polls, robbed the opposition of the two-thirds majority needed to block presidential vetoes, said Ignacio Labaqui, a local analyst with New York-based consultancy Medley Global Advisors.  This is a significant boost for the Macri administration, particularly because of the defeat of Cristina in Buenos Aires province,  Labaqui said. Fernandez s second-place showing still grants her one of the province s three Senate seats under Argentina s list system. One third of the Senate and half of the house were elected, and Macri s coalition will not have a majority.  The private sector has worried about a political resurgence by Fernandez, who is loved by millions of low-income Argentines helped by generous social spending during her administrations.  Fernandez thanked voters at her campaign headquarters and said her Citizen s Unity party would remain a firm opposition to Macri s economic model. Critics say Fernandez s growth-at-all-costs policies stoked inflation and distorted the economy through heavy-handed  currency controls. She has been further isolated politically by graft accusations. Fernandez, who as a senator will have immunity from arrest but not from trial, says there may have been corruption in her government but denies personal wrongdoing. Bullrich and Fernandez were tied in a non-binding primary in August but Bullrich pulled ahead in polls soon after, helped by a burst of economic growth as Fernandez failed to unify the Peronist opposition behind her.  People are more confident in the future, the economy, in making investments. They are tired of corruption and populism,  said Cecilia de Francesca, a 50-year-old writer who was celebrating at the Cambiemos campaign headquarters.  Argentina s Merval stock index and its peso currency have strengthened on bets Fernandez would not get enough support to launch a serious bid for the presidency in 2019. Investors, particularly in Argentina s vast agriculture and budding shale oil sectors, have said they want to see Macri push through labor and tax reforms aimed at lowering business costs in Latin America s third-biggest economy.

Public works blitz helps Macri coalition in Argentina midterm vote,"LANUS, Argentina (Reuters) - Adriana Rodriguez, a 59-year-old vendor at an open-air market in an industrial city in Argentina s Buenos Aires province, never imagined her home would be connected to the sewage system. But as business-friendly President Mauricio Macri invested in infrastructure ahead of Sunday s legislative election victory, sewage construction in her hometown of Lanus advanced to within two blocks of Rodriguez s house. She expects pipes to reach her home soon.   My husband and I thought we would die without getting connected to the sewage system,  she said.  It is a step forward.   Like many of the working-class suburbs surrounding Argentina s capital that collectively make up the country s most important electoral region, Lanus has long been a bastion of support for the Peronist movement, which generally emphasizes strong unions and redistributive policies. Macri s coalition, which initially struggled to appeal to the working class, went after those votes with a 150 billion peso ($8.7 billion) public works plan in Buenos Aires province, home to more than a third of Argentine voters. It paved roads and built express bus lanes after a decade of stagnant infrastructure investment under former populist President Cristina Fernandez. That helped Macri s  Let s Change  coalition defeat Fernandez in the province s Senate race on Sunday. In Lanus, Macri s candidate beat Fernandez with 40.8 percent of votes versus 38.9 percent. That compared to a virtual tie in an Aug. 13 primary.  People now identify  Macrismo  with public works,  said Marcos Buscaglia, founding partner at Buenos Aires political and economic consultancy Alberdi Partners.  It has given them a lot of hope to actually see paved roads, sewers, and the like.   When a Macri ally took over as Lanus mayor in December 2015 from a Peronist, just 35 percent of the city s residents were connected to the sewage system. The municipality is aiming for 100 percent connection by 2019, and state-run water service company AySA says it has invested 5.6 billion pesos ($321.7 million) in Lanus, including 60 sewage pipe projects benefiting nearly 300,000 residents. Some remain skeptical. Many of the projects are being financed with debt, a hot button issue in Argentina due to still raw memories of the country s 2001 debt default and economic crisis. In August, the Inter-American Development Bank pledged $305 million to fund water projects, including sewerage in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area.  The moment will come when the lenders want to collect,  said Alberto Francisco, a 46-year-old shopkeeper in Lanus, a Fernandez supporter.  We will end up like in 2001: without money.

Gambian ministry says up to Togo to resolve crisis,"BANJUL (Reuters) - Gambia s Foreign Ministry said on Monday it was up to the people of Togo to decide whether President Faure Gnassingbe should stay in power after the minister told Reuters at the weekend that mediators should persuade Togo s leader to step aside.  Gnassingbe took power in 2005 on the death of his father who had ruled since 1967. Togo is mired in a political crisis in which at least 10 people have been killed during protests since August.  At this moment, there is no reason warranting the government of the Republic of The Gambia to take a position, since the Togolese people continue to make efforts to find a solution to the crisis,  the Foreign Ministry said in a statement after the Reuters interview was published. Two days previously, Gambia s Foreign Minister Ousainou Darboe told Reuters:  I think the African Union and ECOWAS should engage Togo and persuade the president to step down,  referring to the pan-African body and West African regional bloc.   When it goes against accepted norms I don t think it should be treated as an internal affair,  he added. Currently, Gambia and Togo are the only countries in the 15-nation ECOWAS bloc without time limits on mandates. ECOWAS sought to make this law across the region in 2015 but Togo and Gambia voted against it, although Gambia is now changing its constitution.  The Gambian ministry statement on Facebook said that whether Togo s president should remain in power was the sole and sovereign decision of the people of Togo. It said the two countries remained bonded by strong ties.     Gnassingbe is currently in his third term. Opponents have organized mass protests since August amid growing frustration over delays to constitutional reform and are seeking an end to his rule.  Security forces have repressed protests, firing on demonstrators, and raised the chances Gnassingbe could be toppled as a result of popular anger, as happened in Burkina Faso in 2014. Criticism of Gnassingbe s government by foreign powers and other ECOWAS countries has so far been muted, perhaps because the Togolese leader holds the ECOWAS chairmanship until June 2018.     Darboe was the main opponent of former President Yahya Jammeh during his 22-year rule which ended in January as ECOWAS troops marched into Gambia to uphold an election result. He was imprisoned for most of last year for joining a series of protests on electoral reform and repressive measures against Jammeh s opponents. He told Reuters in the interview he thought regional talks with Gnassingbe should begin after a planned referendum in Togo on term limits. A date for the vote has yet to be set. The planned referendum has failed to appease the opposition who say that it would not be retroactive, meaning that Gnassingbe could stay until 2030.  In a statement, the AU and ECOWAS have welcomed the proposed reforms, called for peace and encouraged dialogue.    Gambia s government plans a constitutional review to cap a president s tenure to just two four- or five-year terms, among other reforms, Darboe said.  No national assembly should have the power to nullify that law as we ve seen elsewhere in Africa,  he said.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
"Despite apology, Indonesia asks why U.S. blocked military chief's travel","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia said on Monday it had made urgent requests for an explanation why its military chief was barred from traveling to the United States, as anger simmered in the world s largest Muslim-majority country over the diplomatic incident. Armed forces commander General Gatot Nurmantyo was stopped on Saturday from boarding an Emirates flight to the United States, despite having a visa and an official invitation to a conference from his counterpart, the chairman of the U.S joint chiefs of staff, General Joseph Dunford. Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said she had accepted an official apology from the deputy U.S. ambassador in Jakarta but awaited a detailed explanation.  We conveyed that we still await clarification, an explanation why this happened,  Marsudi told reporters after meeting the U.S. envoy.  There is a sense of urgency to this that we have conveyed to them,  she said, adding that U.S. officials were  trying to coordinate with relevant authorities in the U.S. to find out what really happened.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis apologized for the incident to his Indonesian counterpart, Ryamizard Ryacudu, on the sidelines of an ASEAN meeting in the Philippines, and the two were photographed shaking hands.  I can confirm that he did a pull-aside with the Indonesian minister and expressed regret and apologized for the inconvenience,  Captain Jeff Davis, a spokesman for Mattis, told Reuters.  In a statement, the U.S. embassy in Jakarta said:  This issue has been resolved. There is no restriction on General Gatot s travel and we look forward to welcoming (him) to the United States.       Indonesia generally enjoys good ties with the United States. But relations have sometimes been strained over U.S. resource companies operating in Indonesia or alleged rights abuses involving Indonesia s military. It was not immediately clear whether Nurmantyo, who has made official visits to the United States before, would attend the conference as scheduled on Monday and Tuesday. In Washington, U.S. Homeland Security Department spokesman Dave Lapan said the U.S. embassy in Jakarta had told Nurmantyo s office that he might be delayed in boarding his flight because of unspecified  U.S. security protocols.  Lapan said the U.S. government was unable to resolve the problem before Nurmantyo arrived at the airport and he was denied boarding. The general was eventually cleared and booked on another flight but  he chose not to travel,  Lapan added.  The U.S. government is dedicated to ensuring that all persons traveling to the United States are screened and properly vetted. We regret that the passenger and his wife were inconvenienced,  Lapan said in an emailed statement. The spokesman declined to respond to a question about the security protocols that led to Nurmantyo being denied boarding, saying:  We re not able to discuss the specifics of individual cases.  Some Indonesians reacted indignantly to the incident, putting up banners around the capital calling for the U.S. ambassador to be expelled and for Americans to be  sent home .  Former Indonesian Ambassador to the United States Dino Patti Djalal called for a stronger government reaction.   The government should not be asking for a clarification, but rather conveying a protest to the U.S. side,  he said on Twitter. Nurmantyo has frequently courted controversy in Indonesia over what analysts perceive to be his political ambitions. He has been accused of whipping up nationalist sentiment by promoting the notion that Indonesia is besieged by  proxy wars  waged by foreign states looking to undermine the country.  This month, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said the armed forces should stay out of politics and ensure their loyalty was only to the state and the government - a statement many believed referred to Nurmantyo s actions. Nurmantyo is due to retire next March and many expect him to run for vice president or even president in 2019. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Israeli brass casts doubt on blaming shelling on Hezbollah,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli military officials were quoted on Monday rowing back from an assertion by the defense minister that Hezbollah was behind a spate of shelling from Syria, which could increase tension on Israel s northern frontier. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been warning that Israel, which has largely stayed out of the six-year-old Syrian civil war, could step up attacks in retaliation for shelling across the frontier, or to block Damascus s Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah reinforcements from setting up bases. That could thrust the Israelis into confrontation with Syria and potential run-ins with its big-power backer, Russia. Israel last battled Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006, and has occasionally fired on Syria to attack what it said were Hezbollah or Iranian targets during the civil war, but has mainly avoided direct fighting against Syria since their last war in 1973.    Twice last week, mortar rounds or rockets launched from Syria hit areas of the Israeli-held Golan Heights, causing no casualties but drawing Israeli artillery fire against Syrian army posts. Addressing his parliamentary faction on Monday, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, a far right politician, said the Golan shelling was carried out by a Syrian cell on Hezbollah s orders without Damascus having been informed, to stoke Israeli-Syrian fighting. Lieberman did not detail the source of his information.  There was a personal instruction by (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah to compartmentalize Assad and his regime from the execution of this shooting ... with the goal of dragging us into the Syrian mire,  Lieberman said in the televised remarks.  Therefore I call here both on the Assad regime ... and also on the Russian forces that are present there, to restrain Hezbollah.   Within hours, every major Israeli media outlet aired remarks attributed to unnamed military officers casting doubt on Lieberman s account.  We have no information supporting Lieberman s statement purporting that the (Syrian shelling) cell was run by Hezbollah personnel,  the top-rated Channel 2 television quoted  sources in the IDF (Israel Defence Forces)  as saying.  Lieberman s office   did not immediately respond to  the comments contradicting him. A Lieber man confidant who requested anonymity told Reuters :  The defense minister spoke based on his own judgment and assessment.  Hezbollah did not respond to Lieberman s allegations, but its affiliated TV station Al-Manar noted the Israeli media dissent. In what appeared to be a reference to Israel s efforts to coordinate its actions in Syria with Moscow, Lieberman said Russian military commanders in Syria  have received all the (information) that they need on this matter . There was no immediate comment from officials in Moscow. Syria s Foreign Ministry said after Saturday s exchange of fire on the Golan that Israeli strikes would have  grave consequences . Lieberman says Israel is doing everything in its power to stave off military confrontation on the northern front. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Ankara mayor quits in Erdogan purge of local government,"ANKARA (Reuters) - The mayor of Ankara said on Monday he will step down this week, the fifth mayor from the ruling party to quit in recent weeks in the face of demands for a purge of local politics by President Tayyip Erdogan. Melih Gokcek, a staunch Erdogan loyalist who has been mayor of Ankara for 23 years and won five consecutive elections, said on Twitter on Monday that he would leave office on Saturday, after meeting with Erdogan at the presidential palace. Four other mayors from the ruling party have already stepped down in recent weeks, including Istanbul s Mayor Kadir Topbas, following demands that they resign from Erdogan, who says he is seeking a renewal of his ruling AK Party.  Three mayors from our party have handed in their resignations so far, and there are three more. I believe they will hand theirs in as soon as possible,  Erdogan told a news conference in Ankara last week before Gokcek and one other mayor resigned. Erdogan decision to target the mayors follows his narrow victory in a referendum to grant himself sweeping powers last year, which was more popular with rural than urban voters. Seventeen of the country s 30 largest cities voted against it. Since then, Erdogan has spoken of the need for renewal in local government and the ruling AK Party, citing signs of  metal fatigue  within administrations. Gokcek, generally regarded as a staunch Erdogan loyalist, is well known in Turkey for tweets in which he has engaged in spats with journalists and with other senior members of the AKP. In February he suggested the U.S.-based cleric blamed by Erdogan for a failed coup last year might be plotting an earthquake, with the help of foreign powers. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Rwandan leader's would-be rival Rwigara and her mother denied bail,"KIGALI (Reuters) - A Rwandan court denied bail on Monday to a vocal critic of President Paul Kagame who was barred from running against him in an August election and later jailed on charges of incitement and forgery that are widely seen as politically motivated. Diane Rwigara and her mother, Adeline, who was also refused bail, said they planned to appeal. Her sister Anne, who is a  U.S. citizen, was granted bail.  All three women are charged with inciting insurrection while Diane is also accused of forging the signatures of some people  she said backed her run for president. Rwigara has said the charges are intended to silence her family and supporters as punishment for her political ambitions. Rejecting the bail request, the lead judge on a three-member panel said there was  strong evidence  to prosecute Rwigara.  Both Diane Rwigara and Adeline Rwigara must be remanded for 30 days,  she said. The 35-year-old accountant has repeatedly accused Kagame of stifling dissent and criticized his Rwandan Patriotic Front s near total grip since it fought its way to power to end a genocide in 1994.  She had planned to run against Kagame in the August poll but her candidacy was blocked by the electoral board on the grounds that she had not submitted enough supporters  signatures and some of the names she did send in belonged to dead people. Kagame won the election with 98.8 percent of the vote.  Adeline and Anne Rwigara had earlier told the court that they and Diane were tortured and deprived of food while in jail awaiting trial, including being kept in solitary confinement and  handcuffed day and night . On Friday, a U.N. subcommittee on the prevention of torture suspended a visit to Rwanda, citing obstructions by authorities. The Rwandan government denied impeding the investigators  work and said the allegations were baseless. Diane s brother Arioste Rwigara said the bail denial was   absurd  and the charges against his mother and sisters were like those used by  tyrannical governments of the middle ages .  Kagame won international praise for restoring stability in Rwanda and presiding over a rapid economic recovery after the genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and politically moderate ethnic Hutus were killed. But human rights groups say he has muzzled independent media and suppressed potential democratic opponents. Some critics of the government have been imprisoned or killed.

Czech election winner Babis calls minority government 'unrealistic',"LANY, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Czech billionaire Andrej Babis, the runaway winner of last weekend s parliamentary election, said on Monday he wanted to form a governing coalition with a stable partner, and a minority government was an unrealistic plan. Babis s search for government partners is running into trouble. He faces fraud charges - which he denies - that have led other parties to rule out working with him, even though his ANO party got 29.6 percent of the vote, nearly triple its closest competitor. The anti-establishment party scored at polls with pledges to clean up corruption and bring a businessman s touch to governance, winning over voters who shunned mainstream parties. Babis s popularity has grown during his time in the current center-left government, which has been marked by fast economic growth, a balanced budget, falling unemployment and rising wages. Babis said after talks with President Milos Zeman at a presidential chateau on Monday that the president would ask him next week to begin leading talks on forming a new cabinet. Traditionally, the president asks the leader of the winning party to lead talks before formally appointing a prime minister. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker sent a congratulatory letter to Babis, saying that the new government should keep in mind the European Union s common values.  I wish you all the best for the challenge ahead in terms of forming a stable government that will be able to position the Czech Republic as an important participant in the efforts to make the European Union more united, stronger and more democratic on the basis of our common values,  he said. Babis told reporters he preferred having as few parties as possible in the next government.  A single-color government is not realistic ... We want to negotiate a coalition government,  Babis told reporters.  We of course prefer a stable partner in government for the whole term.  ANO will control 78 seats in the 200-member lower house. Babis said a link with the election runner-up, the center-right Civic Democrat party, made sense based on seats in the lower house - together, the two would have a majority. The party, though, has so far refused to cooperate.  In other options, more partners would be needed. Babis s current partners, the leftist Social Democrats of Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka and the centrist Christian Democrats, have rejected a government with ANO unless it pledges Babis will not be part of it. Babis said he did not want a government that would include Communists and the anti-EU, anti-immigration SPD party, which made surprisingly a strong showing in the election. His position against a minority government also seemed to rule out seeking their support in a less formal arrangement.     Police are looking at whether Babis, the country s second richest person, hid ownership of a convention center to receive a 2 million-euro EU subsidy in 2008. He has said the investigation was part of efforts to kick him out of politics. Opponents see Babis, worth an estimated $4 billion, as a danger to democracy, fearing his business and media power could pose conflicts of interest. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Germany's coalition-seeking Greens and liberals find common ground on tax,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The two parties that are in talks to join German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives in government inched closer together in one of the most bitterly contested policy areas on Monday, brightening prospects for a coalition. Merkel opened what promise to be marathon coalition talks on Friday, hoping to bring three opposing political camps into a stable government despite signs there would be less money to paper over differences. Further talks to discuss tax, finances and Europe are planned for Tuesday. Merkel said she was hoping to complete exploratory talks   an initial stage during which parties decide whether to go ahead with full-blown coalition negotiations   by Nov. 17 or 18, participants in a meeting of her conservative bloc said. At that point the conservative sister parties, the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens should have a document that lays out the rough outlines of what a coalition would work on, the participants cited Merkel as saying. Cem Ozdemir, leader of the environmentalist Greens, welcomed a proposal by the FDP for global action to make it harder for large technology companies to book their taxes in more favorable jurisdictions.  I m pleased that FDP leader Christian Lindner has moved on this, saying that Internet companies for example should be more strongly and fairly taxed,  said Ozdemir, highlighting progress made in an area where the two parties had been far apart.  It cannot be right that Amazon and Apple use Europe as a location and use its infrastructure, but refuse to contribute appropriately to its financing even as every bookseller is chased down if he doesn t pay tax on time,  he added. Lindner, whose party advocates low tax and fiscal discipline, also called for deeper cooperation within the European Union and the Group of 20 leading economies to make global firms pay more tax. The ability of international companies to minimize their tax liabilities by booking profits in lower-tax jurisdictions has come under the spotlight in recent years as cash-strapped states struggle to finance expanding social and security liabilities.  I can imagine tax increases for companies like Apple,  Lindner told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, in an apparent sacrifice of one of his party s shibboleths to smooth the path towards an unprecedentedly tricky three-way coalition. Merkel s conservatives suffered punishing losses in this month s national election, forcing them to patch together a heterogeneous three-way coalition with few precedents in Germany s post-war history.  The potential three-way pact has been dubbed a  Jamaica  coalition because the three parties  colors   black, yellow and green   match those of the Jamaican flag. The Greens want to boost infrastructure and environment spending, but the FDP and fiscal hawks in the conservative camp view spending proposals with concern. The talks, which continue tomorrow, are set to drag on until at least the end of the year.  Merkel s Christian Democrat party estimates that the smaller parties  tax and spending proposals would cost as much as 100 billion euros ($117.37 billion) over the next four years, three times what its expert reckon is available.   Senior conservative Volker Kauder said if the three-way alliance agreed to govern together it would stick to the  black zero    or balanced budget   that was a hallmark of outgoing Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble s tenure.  You can assume that we will of course make the balanced budget an object of coalition negotiations if they happen,  he said ahead of a meeting of the conservatives in parliament.  And in the exploratory talks it was not disputed at all: There will be no new debt. We ll stick to the black zero.  German newspaper Handelsblatt cited an internal finance ministry paper as saying the new government should  preferably  use the roughly 30 billion euros of leeway for tax cuts, infrastructure investment   especially expanding the broadband network   and tackling the causes of migration. It said all further measures should completely come out of the budgets of the sector they relate to and should be financed either by higher revenues or cuts in other areas. The Finance Ministry was not immediately available to comment on the report.         Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt, a conservative, told Bild newspaper that immigration limits, social benefits and the future of Europe remained big areas of conflict. Lindner maintained the hard line on Greece that his party is known for, saying that any country that took a debt haircut would need to leave the euro zone. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
"After U.N. troubles, Haiti wary of new justice mission","PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Reuters) - A new United Nations-backed mission to support Haiti s justice system has had a mixed reaction from local politicians and civil society groups after long-standing criticism of its predecessor. President Jovenel Moise s government has welcomed the deployment of the U.N. mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) in the face of opposition skepticism. A U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti intended to restore stability after a 2004 coup ended in October after 13 years.  Known as MINUSTAH, the departing mission was dogged by controversies, including the introduction of cholera to the island and allegations of sexual abuse. The new mission will focus specifically on the justice system and the police. Mamadou Diallo, deputy special representative of the U.N. Secretary General in Haiti and acting head of the new mission, said its aim was to build on MINUSTAH s work to strengthen the security, bolster democracy and the country s institutions. That would enable a  social contract  to be established between Haiti s rulers and the people, Diallo said. However, MINUJUSTH has quickly come under fire.  The country should expect nothing positive from this new mission which is only a tactic to continue with the occupation that the Haitian people have rejected,  former presidential candidate Eric Jean-Baptiste said. Retired army colonel Himmler Rebu, a former cabinet minister and one-time contender for the presidency, also had harsh words.  The U.N. stabilization mission has been here for the past 13 years and they have done nothing, except for preventing armed thugs from taking over the presidential palace,  Rebu said. The new mission, which officially launched last week, has a six-month renewable term ending April 15, 2018. It will include 1,275 UN police officers and will train Haiti s national police. Lucien Jura, a spokesman for Moise, said the president expected MINUJUSTH to help correct flaws in the justice system, and several civil society organizations expressed hope that the mission can make a difference. However, much will depend on Haiti s leaders, they say.  The mission may have all the good will you can imagine, but if Haitian authorities don t play their part in efforts ... we may not have the expected results,  said Pierre Esperance, head of the National Network to Defend Human Rights, known as RNDDH. The U.S. State Department said in a statement that the transition to MINUJUSTH marked a turning point in Haiti  from stability efforts to a focus on justice and the rule of law .

"As Tillerson heads to Pakistan, Islamabad wary of deepening U.S.-India ties","ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - As U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson heads to Pakistan on Tuesday to pressure Islamabad to act over militants targeting Afghanistan from its soil, anxious Pakistanis may be equally interested in dissuading Washington s deepening ties with India. Nuclear-armed Pakistan, a staunch U.S. Cold War ally and key player in the U.S.-backed invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, has watched warily as Washington has in recent years pivoted towards its arch-foe. Islamabad views its much-bigger neighbor as an existential threat and the two nations have fought three wars since their violent separation at the end of colonial rule in 1947. Tillerson, due to meet Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Pakistan s powerful military chiefs in a one-day visit, is expected to urge Pakistan to do more to root out Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants operating on its soil. But he is also expected to hear Pakistani officials warn him that drawing nuclear-armed India deeper into Afghanistan would destabilise the region and do little to end the 16-year war that is now America s longest military conflict.  Bringing India into the mix is like adding kerosene to fire,  said Miftah Ismail, a state minister and close ally of Prime Minister Abbasi.  It s a complete red line. India has no political role to play in Afghanistan as far as we are concerned.      Many Pakistanis feel betrayed that its traditional ally is now cosying up to India over Afghanistan. But the anger runs both ways. The United States accuses Pakistan of playing a double game since 2001, offering public backing to Washington while turning a blind eye, or even at times assisting, the Afghan Taliban and other militants who carry out deadly attacks against U.S. forces and their allies in Afghanistan. Pakistan supported the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s as a hedge to Indian influence in Afghanistan, and analysts say its military and security services maintained ties long after the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001. Pakistan denies providing a safe haven for Afghan Taliban and other militant fighters. Tillerson, during a visit to Afghanistan on Monday, said Washington has made some  very specific requests of Pakistan in order for them to take action to undermine the support the Taliban receives and other terrorist organizations receive . U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis earlier this month said the United States would try  one more time  to work with Pakistan in Afghanistan, before opting for more punitive measures. President Donald Trump has vowed to be tougher on Pakistan than his predecessors. The United States has threatened further military aid cuts and U.S. officials have mooted targeted sanctions against Pakistani military figures, but in the past two weeks there have been hints of a slight thawing in ties. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Tillerson last week called Abbasi to thank Pakistan after its army rescued a U.S.-Canadian couple who were held hostage by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network for nearly five years, along with their three children born in captivity. Relations were further boosted when Omar Khalid Khorasani, leader of the lethal Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) group who Islamabad had been trying to catch for years, was killed by a U.S. drone strike last week. India has increased aid to Afghanistan in recent years and last year promised to ship more arms. Such moves have aggravating fears in Pakistan that it will find itself wedged between two hostile neighbors.  Islamabad bristles at the idea that India holds the key to ending the Afghanistan conflict, and fears U.S. meddling could unsettle a delicate balance of power in South Asia.  Promoting a higher involvement of India in Afghanistan will only worsen the historic strategic rivalries playing out in the region,  said Sherry Rehman, Pakistan s former ambassador to United States and a senior member of the opposition Pakistan People s Party. Pakistan points to the 3.5 million Afghan refugees it hosts as proof that it has more than anyone else to lose from chaos in Afghanistan, and has emphasized the need for greater cooperation and intelligence sharing with United States and Afghanistan. But while Pakistan may not like it, India looks set to continue playing a role in Afghanistan, according to Sushant Sareen, a foreign policy analyst at the Vivekananda International Foundation, a think-tank with ties to the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.   The message is very clear that India is an important player when it comes to coordinating policies between Afghanistan and Washington,  said Sareen. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Factbox: U.S.-Pakistan ties falter as Afghanistan war drags on,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Ties between the United States and Pakistan have veered between extremes over the past four decades. Here are some of the key moments in their turbulent relationship:  1980s: United States pumps weapons, money and foreign fighters into Afghanistan, with the help of Pakistan s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, to support mujahideen fighters defeat Soviet Union troops in Afghanistan. 1990: The United States imposes sanctions on Pakistan over Islamabad s covert nuclear program. With the Soviet Union routed in Afghanistan and the Cold War ending, Pakistan had lost its importance as a regional ally. 1998: The United States imposes sanctions on Pakistan and India over their nuclear tests. 1999: Washington imposes more sanctions on Pakistan after army chief Pervez Musharraf topples a democratically elected government in a military coup. 2001: After the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, the United States asks Musharraf to help track down al Qaeda and remove the Taliban from power. Pakistan turns on its former Taliban allies and arrests al Qaeda leaders.  * Washington removes all sanctions against Pakistan in the wake of Pakistan s support for its war against al Qaeda and other Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan. 2004: George W. Bush s administration designates Pakistan a  major non-NATO ally , boosting Islamabad s diplomatic prestige and giving Pakistan greater access to U.S. military technology. 2011: CIA contractor Raymond Davis kills two Pakistanis in the eastern city of Lahore in January 2011. Davis was acquitted of murder and allowed to leave Pakistan after a $2.3 million payment was made to the men s families. * U.S. troops kill Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil in May 2011. The raid, kept secret from Pakistani authorities, was a humiliation for Pakistan s powerful military and again raised questions about whether it was harboring militants. * NATO helicopters and fighter jets attack Pakistani military outposts by accident, killing 24 soldiers. Pakistani retaliated by blocking a NATO supply route through its territory to Afghanistan for more than seven months. 2016: U.S. Congress blocks the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan. Military aid to Pakistan reduced. 2017: U.S. President Donald Trump outlines a new South Asia policy.

Tillerson pays flying visit to Afghanistan to discuss U.S. strategy,"BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday discussed with Afghan leaders the U.S. strategy for ending America s longest war, in a brief, unreported visit that underscored the challenge of quelling the country s insurgency. Tillerson spent almost three hours in a heavily guarded building in the main U.S. military facility in Afghanistan, most of the time in talks with President Ashraf Ghani, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah and other U.S. and Afghan officials. A small group of U.S. media accompanying the former ExxonMobil CEO on his first official visit to Afghanistan were prohibited for security reasons from filing dispatches, photographs and video until they returned to Qatar. While there have been no recent attacks on the airbase by Taliban insurgents, the sprawling facility north of Kabul has been regularly hit since the 2001 U.S. invasion by rockets, mortars and explosives-laden vehicles. A recent visit to Kabul by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was greeted by a rocket attack on the city s main airport. Speaking at a brief news conference after his meeting with Ghani and Abdullah, Tillerson said he would be flying to Pakistan on Tuesday to reinforce the Trump administration s demand that Islamabad move against the Taliban and other extremists based inside its borders or face the consequences.  We have made some very specific requests of Pakistan in order for them to take action to undermine the support the Taliban receives and other terrorist organizations receive,  he said.  U.S. policy toward Islamabad  will be based upon whether they take action that we feel is necessary to move the process forward for both creating opportunity for reconciliation and peace in Afghanistan but also ensuring a stable future for Pakistan,  he continued. Tillerson said he would then travel to India to discuss a request that it expand its economic and development assistance to Afghanistan. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Slain sergeant's widow says Trump call 'made me cry even worse',", (Reuters) - The widow of a U.S. Army sergeant killed in Niger this month said on Monday that President Donald Trump had  made me cry even worse  in a condolence telephone call when he said her husband  knew what he signed up for.  Myeshia Johnson s comments in an ABC interview, her first to the media about the call from Trump, fueled a controversy that has raged for a week over how the president has handled consoling relatives of slain service members. After the interview aired, Trump again defended himself, saying in a Twitter post that his conversation with Johnson had been  very respectful.  In the  Good Morning America  interview, Johnson also said she has been told little about how her husband, Sergeant La David T. Johnson, was killed and has not been allowed to see his body.  La David Johnson was one of four U.S. Army special forces soldiers killed during an Oct. 4 ambush in the West African nation.  Last week, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and friend of Johnson s family, Frederica Wilson, said she listened to the call on speakerphone in a car as she rode with them to receive the late sergeant s body at a Miami airport, and that Trump had upset the relatives. That drew a rebuke from the president, who dubbed Wilson  wacky  and denied her account.  I didn t say what that congresswoman said,  Trump told reporters last week.  I had a very nice conversation with the woman, with the wife who ... sounded like a lovely woman.  In Monday s interview, Myeshia Johnson said,  The president said that he (her husband) knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway ... And it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he couldn t remember my husband s name.  In his tweet after the interview aired, Trump said,  I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!  Johnson said the military has told her little about what happened to her husband and his comrades in Niger, where about 800 U.S. troops are engaged in counter-terrorism operations against an affiliate of the Islamic State militant group. She also said she was upset she has not been allowed to see his body.  I don t know what s in that box,  said of the coffin.  It could be empty for all I know.  Johnson said she did not say anything during the call with the president, adding that afterward, she was  very upset and hurt. It made me cry even worse.  Asked what she might now tell Trump, she said she had  nothing to say to him.   Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, a veteran who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam and who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Monday that lawmakers want answers about the ambush in Niger.  We should not be fighting about a brave American who lost his life serving his country. That should not be a topic in America today,  he told ABC s  The View  program, adding that his committee needed more information about the incident.  Unless you learn the lessons, then you re going to repeat them,  he said. In separate interviews on Sunday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer both said they backed McCain s efforts to get more details, and that they had not been aware that the United States had so many military personnel in Niger. U.S. forces do not have a direct combat role in Niger, but they help its army with intelligence and reconnaissance in the government s efforts to target violent extremist groups. The current controversy erupted after Trump said a week ago that some of his predecessors as president  didn t do anything  to console the relatives of fallen soldiers. He did not back up the claim and it was shown to be false. [nL2N1MS0M9] The acrimony generated around his call with Johnson echoed a controversy last year during the presidential campaign, when Trump sparred with Khizr Khan and Ghazala Khan, whose son was killed while serving in Iraq in 2004.

New school offers education 'salvation' for Syrian girls in Lebanon,"BAR ELIAS, Lebanon (Reuters) - A new girls  school for Syrian refugees in Lebanon s poor Bekaa region is aiming to give girls from conservative backgrounds  the chance at a formal education.  Gaining access to education in general is difficult for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, but for girls from socially conservative families who disapprove of mixed schools, it is even harder.       Zahra al-Ayed, 14, and her sister Batoul, 17, were from a village in Syria s northern Idlib province where women were expected to marry young.  But the experience of fleeing war and living in harsh poverty woke her parents to the life-changing importance of education, the girls  mother Mirdiyeh al-Ayed said.   My eldest daughter tells me that she will not marry until after she finishes her education. She even wants to travel abroad and learn,  she said.      Human Rights Watch organisation said in its latest report in April that more than half a million refugee children are out of school in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. In Lebanon, international donors paid for 200,000 public school spaces for Syrian children in 2015-2016, according to the HRW report, but only 149,000 children actually enrolled. Lebanese and international non-governmental organizations have been striving to fill the gap, and to eliminate the legal, financial and language barriers preventing refugee children from getting their education.     For the al-Ayed family, used to Syria s system of gender segregation after the age of 12, one big barrier to enrolling the girls was the lack of single-sex schools in Lebanon that accept refugees.  The new school that Zahra will attend is in Bar Elias in the Bekaa valley and was opened on Thursday by the Kayany Foundation, a Lebanese charity. It educates 160 Syrian girls aged from 14-18 who have missed school for several years.  Those who manage to pass the Lebanese system s eighth grade exams - usually taken at the age of 14 or 15 - can join the local Lebanese public school in Bar Elias, which Batoul al-Ayed has done.  The Kayany Foundation school teaches the official Lebanese curriculum, which includes science, mathematics, Arabic and English, in addition to vocational skills.  The school, built from colorful pre-fabricated classrooms, is its seventh in the Bekaa valley, where the majority of the Syrian refugee communities are located in Lebanon. It was meant to address the Syrian parents  concerns about sending their teenage daughters to schools for both girls and boys. All its teachers are women and it provides transportation for students between home and school.  Education is salvation for the refugee girls,  said Nora Jumblatt, head of the Kayany Foundation, at the opening ceremony.  Funding for the school was secured for this year from international charity Save the Children and the United Nations Women For Peace Association, according to Kayany officials.  I have a dream to become a pharmacist,  Rama, 19, who is preparing to apply for the eight grade exams at Kayany school said. In normal times, Rama would already have been applying for university at that age.  I still want to go back to Syria and fulfill my dream there, in Damascus University,  she added.

Catalonia warns of civil disobedience as Madrid readies direct rule,"MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia said on Monday it was confident all officials including police would defy attempts by Madrid to enforce direct rule on the region in a dispute that is raising fears of unrest among Spain s European allies. The Spanish government has invoked special constitutional powers to fire the regional government and force elections to counter an independence drive. A vote in the national Senate to implement direct rule is due on Friday. But leaders of the secessionist campaign said a referendum on Oct. 1, in which 43 percent of the electorate voted, gave them a mandate to claim independence from the rest of Spain.   It s not that we will refuse (orders). It is not a personal decision. It is a seven million-person decision,  Catalonia s foreign affairs chief Raul Romeva told BBC radio. Romeva was asked whether he believed all institutions, including the police, would follow orders from Catalan institutions rather than obey the Spanish government.  And from that perspective, I have no doubt that all civil servants in Catalonia will keep following the instructions provided by the elected and legitimate institutions that we have right now in place (in Catalonia),  he said. Catalan authorities said about 90 percent of those who took part in the referendum on Oct. 1 voted for independence. But only 43 percent of the electorate and 1 in 3 Catalans participated, with most opponents of secession staying at home. The crisis over the wealthy Catalan region has raised fears among European countries of a spillover to other parts of the continent. Two wealthy regions of northern Italy voted overwhelmingly on Sunday for greater autonomy, though those referendums were held in line with the constitution and were not binding on Rome. Separatists are active in Belgium s Flanders region, and France s Corsica has long been home to a secessionist movement. At a European Union summit last week, leaders sought to minimize Spain s crisis with Catalonia and described the secession bid as a domestic issue. Civil disobedience was also backed by the far-left party CUP, a key support for Catalonia s pro-independence minority government in the regional parliament, which has called Madrid s actions an aggression against all Catalans.   An aggression which will be met with massive civil disobedience,  the CUP said in a statement. Several hundred Catalan municipalities said they were against direct rule from Madrid and asked the Catalan parliament to vote on a motion rejecting it. Some teachers and firemen also said they would not recognize Spain s authority.  We will not recognize as valid interlocutors those people who are not representatives of popular legitimacy,  the teachers  union USTEC said in a statement.  We will be where we should be in this moment: with the Catalan institutions and with democracy as it fights for its survival.  Spain has said it would fire top Catalan officials if they did not comply with orders but it has remained vague on how it plans to implement direct rule if lower ranking civil servants decide not to follow instructions. Foreign minister Alfonso Dastis said the central government was not planning any arrests. Around 4,000 national police who had been shipped in for the referendum have remained in Catalonia. This comes on top of 5,000 state police already based in the region. They usually act as a back-up to Catalonia s own 17,000-strong police force, the Mossos d Esquadra, though they have also been seen reinforcing security at some official buildings in Catalonia s capital Barcelona. Catalan president Carles Puigdemont has called the Catalan parliament to meet this week to agree on a response to Madrid, something many observers said could pave the way for a formal declaration of independence. The assembly will meet on Thursday to agree a response to direct rule. Puigdemont was also considering appearing before the Spanish Senate to explain his position. The Cercle d Economia, an influential Catalan business association, called on Puigdemont to resolve the crisis by calling a snap election before direct rule becomes effective. Catalonia risked heading into prolonged and uncontrolled insecurity and civil unrest, it said.   Its consequences are unpredictable but, in any case, dramatic in terms of self-government, coexistence, economic growth and employment,  it said in a statement. More than 1,300 companies have decided to transfer their legal headquarters out of Catalonia due to the current uncertainty, according to the national companies registry. However, Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull said calling a snap election was not an option. An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot, in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government. Spain s Deputy Prime Minister said Puigdemont would be out of a job once direct rule was enforced and Madrid would install its own representative. The Spanish government has said it would call a regional election within six months.  They are president of the regional government and senior figures in that government because of the constitution,  said Soraya Saenz de Santamaria during a radio interview.  They are not entrusted with that role by any divine authority,  she said. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1

EU calls report on May-Juncker talks a smear,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said a newspaper report that Jean-Claude Juncker had disparaged Theresa May s  despondent  demeanor after a dinner last week was a deliberate smear intended to disrupt Brexit negotiations. It was the second time in six months that a correspondent for Germany s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung who is respected for his access to Juncker s team has published an account of the EU chief executive s reactions after a dinner meeting with the British prime minister on Britain s EU withdrawal.  But unlike in April, the Commission hotly denied leaking the story, which painted an unflattering picture of a British leader worn down by party in-fighting and  pleading  for the EU s help.  Nothing is true in all of this,  President Juncker told the BBC, adding that May had been  in good shape  and  not tired . The denial came after Juncker s chief-of-staff got into a Twitter spat with his former counterpart in May s team, denying the Briton s allegation that he was the source and pointing a finger at unnamed interests out to hurt relations with London.  It seems some have interest in undermining constructive relations @JunckerEU & PM May,  Martin Selmayr tweeted after the accusation by Nick Timothy.  Who? is the real question.      Timothy, who resigned as May s chief-of-staff after an election upset in June, had accused Selmayr, the German head of Juncker s office, of briefing the FAZ to undermine improved relations between May and EU leaders after a summit last week.      After constructive Council meeting, Selmayr does this,  he tweeted.  Reminder that some in Brussels want no deal or a punitive one.  Selmayr said neither he nor Juncker made the reported comments.  This is false. I know it doesn t fit your clich , @NickJTimothy. But @JunckerEU & I have no interest in weakening PM ... It s an attempt 2 frame EU side & 2 undermine talks.  Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters:  Some people like to point at us to serve their own political agendas ... or even to undermine our own negotiating position. We would appreciate if these people would leave us alone.  He declined to say who might wish the Commission ill. The newspaper stood by its story. Some of the most vocal opponents of May s negotiations have been fellow Conservatives urging her to reject EU demands for money and other concessions and just walk away without a deal. May s spokesman declined comment but recalled that May and Juncker had described the dinner as  constructive and friendly . London was irritated that after the earlier dinner, at 10 Downing Street in April, the FAZ reported that Juncker told aides he thought May was  in another galaxy  with her demands for favors from the European Union after Britain leaves. At the time, EU officials did not contest the thrust of that story. May, who was then expecting the election to strengthen not weaken her, dismissed it as  Brussels gossip . But officials on both sides said the April report had been a setback to creating an atmosphere of trust needed to reach a deal. It prompted reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was also irritated by the leak for the same reason. On Friday, EU leaders moved to speed up talks and spoke of opening a new phase in December. Some said they understood May s difficulties in forging consensus in London.

Two Somali soldiers wounded in gun fight with fellow troops,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Two Somali soldiers were wounded in a gun fight with other troops on Monday, a police officer said, a worrying internal rift for a military with a history of factionalism that is fighting a resurgence by militant Islamists  The al Shabaab group is suspected of being behind the country s single deadliest attack on civilians this month that killed at least 358 people. Nur Ali, a police officer, told Reuters the brief fighting took place in the Yaqshid district of the capital Mogadishu and was triggered by a misunderstanding between the district commissioner and security forces.      The district commissioner s home guards and security forces exchanged gunfire,  Ali said, adding that soldiers briefly seized the commissioner s office.  The dispute was resolved, Ali said, but not before two soldiers were wounded.  Somali s military is often troubled by low morale caused by missed salaries, factionalism and defections. The country has been virtually lawless since the early 1990s after dictator Siad Barre was deposed. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for the twin bombing on Oct. 14 that flattened several buildings but it has carried out attacks on security targets over the years as it fights to topple the western-backed government, often also killing civilians.

"After question on foreign meddling in Brexit, UK says democracy secure","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s democracy is one of the most secure in the world and will remain so, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday in response to a question about a suggestion that there may have been foreign interference in the Brexit vote. Opposition lawmaker Ben Bradshaw last week urged the government to look into reports by advocacy group Open Democracy suggesting that the origin of some Brexit campaign funds was unclear. Bradshaw said in parliament the issue should be investigated  given the widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference in Western democracies . At a briefing with reporters, May s spokesman was asked if the prime minister was concerned about the reports.  I am not aware of those concerns,  he said.  More broadly, as we ve always said, the UK democratic system is amongst one of the most secure in the world and will continue to be so.  Open Democracy, which describes itself as an independent media platform aiming to challenge power and encourage debate, had raised questions about the finances of businessman Arron Banks, one of the main financial backers of the Brexit cause.  The only people concerned are those that still can t come to terms with the fact that they lost the referendum so will come up with more and more ludicrous excuses,  Banks said in a statement texted to Reuters by a spokesman. Banks dismissed Open Democracy s report without addressing it in detail and accused Bradshaw of peddling a  tedious myth  about Russian meddling in the Brexit debate. The Electoral Commission, which regulates political finance in Britain, said in April it was investigating campaign spending by Leave.EU, one of the pro-Brexit organizations funded by Banks. It gave no details of what its probe was about.  I m not remotely worried. We did nothing wrong,  Banks said in the text. A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said the investigation was still going on and it would not provide any further information until it was complete. Open Democracy had also raised concerns about a large donation to Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is now propping up May s minority Conservative government. Open Democracy said the origin of the money, which was spent on campaigning for Brexit, was unclear.  The DUP, which was earlier reported to have said the funds came from  an organization in England that wants to see the union (between the UK s constituent parts) kept , did not respond to repeated requests for comment. During a debate in parliament later on Monday, May was asked whether EU leaders had discussed the issue of Russian interference at a summit last week. She said it had not come up.

Syria's Assad meets once dissident footballers in Damascus,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met two former dissident footballers who returned to the national team for its World Cup qualifying campaign after years in exile, photographs posted by his office showed on Monday. Syria s football team outdid expectations in its campaign to qualify for the World Cup finals, reaching a play-off against Australia on Oct. 10 that they lost 2-1.  The photographs published on the presidency s social media feed showed him apparently in amicable conversation with Firas al-Khatib and Omar al-Soma, players who were both pictured with the Syrian opposition flag early in the conflict. Other photographs showed Assad posing with the whole team and signing a player s jacket. Syria s war, which began with demonstrations against Assad in 2011, has killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians and left more than half the population homeless. The army has gained momentum over the past two years, with military support from Russia and Iran.  The government says its policy is to pardon any Syrians who joined the opposition unless they have  blood on their hands . However, many exiles have said they fear arrest if they return.  The football team s unexpectedly strong performance in the qualifiers was hailed by many government supporters as a unifying moment for the country. But some opposition supporters identified the team with Assad s government, and declined to back it. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Turkey to investigate Galatasaray's 'Rocky' poster over coup links,"ANKARA (Reuters) - The Turkish government has launched an investigation into a poster unfurled by fans of Istanbul s Galatasaray soccer team that pro-Turkish media said was clearly linked to organizers of the 2016 attempted coup. Just before Sunday s match kicked between Galatasaray and local rivals Fenerbahce, the home fans opened a giant red and yellow poster behind the goal showing Sylvester Stallone s famous fictional boxer  Rocky , with the caption  Stand Up  and  They look big because you are kneeling.  Pro-government Turkish media linked the poster and its caption to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of masterminding the July 2016 failed coup attempt. Pro-government daily Takvim said the poster was a reference to a speech by Gulen, where he was quoted reading from a poem that ends with the words  Stand Up Sakarya . Sakarya is a province in northwest Turkey. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim on Monday ordered authorities to carry out an investigation into the poster, sources from his office said. The game between Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, Turkey s biggest fixture, ended in a 0-0 draw after a match that was marred by violence in which a referee was injured. In a statement, Galatasaray said the accusations were  a pathetic attempt  to discredit the club, adding that the same poster was used at a match in May.  We will use all our legal rights against any institution, person and social media account who tried to put the Galatasaray name next to that of the red-handed leader of the heinous terrorist organisation by using the choreography as an excuse,  the club said on its website. Some 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over suspected links to last year s failed coup and more than 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors. Rights groups and Turkey s Western allies have said President Tayyip Erdogan is using the failed coup as a pretext to crush dissent, but the government says the measures are necessary to fight the threats it is facing. Following the statement from Yildirim s office, Galatasaray s shares were down 4.89 percent as of 1535 GMT. Current league leaders Galatasaray are Turkey s most decorated soccer club, with 20 league championships, and became the first Turkish club to win a major European trophy when they won the 2000 UEFA Cup, the predecessor to the Europa league.

Egyptian air force says strikes arms convoy at Libya border,"CAIRO (Reuters) - The Egyptian military said on Monday its air force hit eight four-wheel-drive vehicles carrying arms and explosives at Egypt s western border with Libya, killing the militants on board. A military statement gave no details of the number of fatalities or about which militant group it suspected was transporting the arms. Last Friday Egypt s security forces suffered one of their deadliest attacks, when militants killed police officers using rockets and explosives in a remote area about 135 km (85 miles) southwest of Cairo.    Egyptian security forces have been battling an insurgency by Islamic State that was largely concentrated in the Sinai Peninsula but has in recent months extended to other parts of the country. Egypt has carried out air strikes in Libya occasionally since its neighbor descended into factional fighting in the years following the 2011 civil war that ousted Muammar Gaddafi. In a separate statement, Egypt s armed forces said they had  raided a terrorist stronghold in northern Sinai, killing six very dangerous takfiris  - a term used by hardline Muslims to accuse other Muslims of apostasy.  The statement added that in the raid, which was carried out after the military received information of the stronghold, security forces confiscated  a large amount of arms and ammunition.

Philippines declares battle with Islamist rebels over in Marawi City,"MARAWI CITY/CLARK, Philippines (Reuters) - The Philippines on Monday announced the end of five months of military operations in a southern city held by pro-Islamic State rebels, after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that has marked the country s biggest security crisis in years. Offensive combat operations were terminated after troops put a stop to the last stand of rebel gunmen who clung on inside several buildings in the heart of Marawi, and refused to surrender. Artillery and automatic gunfire were still heard on Monday and Reuters journalists saw flames behind a mosque. The bodies of 40 fighters and two of their wives were found there and in two buildings close by.  Ernesto Abella, spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said the Philippines had prevailed against  the most serious threat of violent extremism and radicalism in the Philippines and in Southeast Asia .  Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the security forces had  nipped the budding infrastructure  of extremist groups.   In crushing thus far the most serious attempt to export violent extremism and radicalism in the Philippines and in the region, we have contributed to preventing its spread in Asia,  Lorenzana said in Clark at a meeting of regional defense ministers. The rebel occupation stunned a military inexperienced in urban combat and stoked wider concerns that Islamic State loyalists have gained influence among local Muslims and have ambitions to use the island of Mindanao as a base for operations in Southeast Asia. Those fears are compounded by the organization of the militant alliance and its ability to recruit young fighters, lure foreign radicals, stockpile huge amounts of arms and endure 154 days of ground offensive and air strikes. The authorities said 920 militants, 165 troops and police and at least 45 civilians were killed in the conflict, which displaced more than 300,000 people. The center of the picturesque lakeside town is now in ruins due to heavy shelling and aerial bombing. The deputy task force commander in Marawi, Colonel Romeo Brawner, said troops would secure the city from militant  stragglers  who might still be alive.  If we find them and they will attack our soldiers or even the civilians, then we will have to defend ourselves,  he told reporters.    After months of slow progress, the military has made significant gains in retaking Marawi in the week since Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State s  emir  in Southeast Asia and Omarkhayam Maute, a leader of the Maute militant group, were killed in a nighttime operation. Another leader and possible bankroller of the operation, Malaysian Mahmud Ahmad, was likely killed also, the military said. Military spokesman, Major General Restituto Padilla, confirmed there was still gunfire ongoing, but there were  no more terrorists  and the army s last battles were with an enemy decimated by the loss of its leadership.  They were formless, they had no place to run,  he said.      Duterte had declared Marawi City liberated six days ago, even though fighting was not actually over. On Sunday, he said it was important to be vigilant because no country could escape Islamic State s  clutches of evil .  I m not trying to scare you, but let s just be prepared for any event,  he said. Lorenzana said six battalions of troops would remain in Marawi and though the battle had been won, the enemy s radical ideology had not been completely annihilated.  He thanked the United States, Australia, Singapore and China for providing weaponry and technical support, including surveillance aircraft, and said the conflict would be a catalyst for closer international cooperation against extremism. The government estimates the rebuilding of the heart of Marawi could cost in excess of $1 billion.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
"Two dead, two wounded in shooting incident on Myanmar-Bangladesh border","YANGON (Reuters) - Two hunters from a remote village in the north of Myanmar s troubled Rakhine state were killed and two others were injured by unidentified gunmen after crossing the border into Bangladesh, Myanmar s government said on Monday. The incident took place on Sunday evening near the village of Aung Thabyay, which is located some 2 kilometers (1.24 miles)from Myanmar s border with Bangladesh.   The four crossed the border fence while searching for a boar and got shot by 15 people wearing civilian clothes with guns 100 yards from the border fence,  Myanmar said in a statement that gave no other details. The wounded hunters were treated at a hospital in the regional town of Maungdaw, some 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of where the incident took place. The hunters belong to a small ethnic group from northern Rakhine called the Daingnet that is mostly Buddhist. Unlike the Rohingya Muslims, they are recognized among Myanmar s 135  national races . About 600,000 people have crossed the border since Aug. 25 when Rohingya Muslim insurgent attacks on security posts were met by a counter-offensive by the Myanmar army in Rakhine.

Turkish soldier killed in PKK attack in southeast: sources,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish military vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device in the southeastern province of Hakkari, killing one soldier, security sources said on Monday. The device was detonated by militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) as the vehicle was passing the road near Turkey s border with Iraq, the sources said.  Turkey s largely Kurdish southeast has been rocked by violence following the collapse of a 2-1/2-year ceasefire between the state and the PKK in 2015. The autonomy-seeking PKK took up arms in 1984, and more than 40,000 people have died in the conflict. It is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.

Save the Children suspends migrant rescues in Mediterranean,"ROME (Reuters) - International humanitarian group Save the Children said on Monday it had suspended migrant rescues in the Mediterranean Sea as departures from Libya slow and security conditions worsen. Save the Children has operated a ship, the Vos Hestia, since September last year, rescuing more than 10,000 migrants from dangerous and overcrowded boats launched by people smugglers.  For too long we have been the substitution for the inexistent and inadequate European policies for search and rescue and for hosting migrants,  Save the Children Director General Valerio Neri said in a statement.   Italian police searched the Vos Hestia on Monday as part of a wider investigation into the role non-government organizations are playing in picking up migrants off the Libya coast and bringing them to Italy. Save the Children said its decision to halt rescues was already planned before the police search. Earlier this year, the government asked humanitarian groups to sign a  code of conduct . The government said the rescuers were providing an incentive for smugglers to put migrants to sea. Police in August seized a migrant rescue boat operated by a German aid group Jugend Rettet. The chief prosecutor in the Sicilian city of Trapani said he had evidence of encounters between traffickers, who escorted illegal immigrants to the NGO boat, and members of its crew. Jugend Rettet denied any wrongdoing. Save the Children said in a statement it was not under investigation and was cooperating with authorities. The documents seized by police on Monday concerned  presumed illegal actions committed by third persons , it said. Several months ago some 10 rescue ships took turns patrolling the North African coast, picking up migrants who reached international waters and bringing them to Italy.  Now only one large ship and a few small ones remain, with many organizations   including Doctors Without Borders   pulling out for various reasons, including security concerns and unhappiness with the attitude of the Italian authorities. The Libyan Coast Guard, funded and trained by Italy, has taken a hostile stance toward the humanitarian boats in a series of incidents on the high seas.  In August, a Libyan vessel intercepted a charity ship and ordered it to sail to Tripoli or risk being fired on. Departures from Libya have fallen dramatically since July, when an armed group that had been deeply involved in smuggling from the city of Sabratha began blocking departures. So far in October sea arrivals to Italy are down more than 75 percent compared with the same month last year. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Four Yemeni soldiers killed by suspected al Qaeda truck bombing,"ADEN (Reuters) - Suspected al Qaeda militants attacked a military checkpoint in the southern Yemen province of Abyan on Monday, killing four soldiers and wounding 10, a military official said. Four men wearing explosive vests emerged from their truck at the checkpoint in the town of Mudia while the driver detonated the vehicle, the official told Reuters. All five attackers were killed in the explosions, which could be felt throughout the town, he said. Al Qaeda s local affiliate in Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP),  later claimed responsibility for the attack in a message on its Telegram channel, according to the SITE monitoring centre The group has taken advantage of a civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s Saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country. AQAP operates in several provinces in south and eastern Yemen, including in Abyan, Shabwa and al-Bayda. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Iraq's Kurdistan region delays elections,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Elections for Iraq s Kurdistan region s presidency and parliament set for Nov. 1 will be delayed because political parties failed to present candidates, the head of the electoral commission Hendrean Mohammed told Reuters on Monday. Parties have been unable to focus on the elections because of turmoil that followed a referendum on Sept. 25 on Kurdish independence, a Kurdish MP said on condition of anonymity. Authorities in Baghdad as well as neighbors Iran and Turkey opposed the referendum that saw a clear independence majority.  Last week, Iraqi forces captured the oil city of Kirkuk and other territory claimed by the Kurds in retaliation for the referendum, dealing a severe blow to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Masoud Barzani. The Kurdish electoral commission s Mohammed, speaking by phone from the KRG capital Erbil, in northern Iraq, said it is up to the Kurdistan region s parliament to fix a new date for the elections. The deadline to present candidates expired last week and was extended until Monday.  The current KRG presidency, held by Barzani since 2005, and parliament, elected in 2013, are expected to continue until new votes are held, he said. The loss of Kirkuk prompted calls from Gorran, the main opposition party to Barzani, for his resignation. Gorran, or the Change Movement, supports the right of Iraq s Kurds for self-determination but it opposed holding the referendum on Sept. 25, saying the timing was ill-chosen.

Iraq builds up forces south of Kurdish oil export pipeline: security sources,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces are deploying tanks and artillery south of a Kurdish-held area of northern Iraq where a section of a Kurdish oil export pipeline is located, security sources said on Monday. The buildup is taking place northwest of Mosul, an official from the Kurdistan Regional Government s (KRG) security council said by phone from the Kurdish capital, Erbil.  An Iraqi government security advisor said the Fish-Khabur area, northwest of Mosul, is the location of crossings into Turkey and Syria that Baghdad wants to bring under its control. But he declined to say if a military move was being prepared.  A pipeline carrying crude across Iraqi Kurdistan connects to a metering station in Fish-Khabur before feeding another pipeline that takes the crude to the Turkish Mediterranean coast for exports. The military buildup is taking place around Rabi a, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Fish-Khabur, the Kurdish security official said. Turkey and Iran both support measures taken by the Iraqi government to isolate the KRG after it held a referendum on Kurdish independence on Sept. 25 and to bring the Kurdistan region s oil exports and land crossings under Baghdad s authority.  Iraq has shown zero signs of de-escalating,  said a statement by the KRG Security Council about the deployment, adding that units being brought to the region include Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation paramilitaries. The Fish-Khabur crossing has been under Kurdish control since 1991, when the United States and western powers imposed a no-fly zone over northern Iraq to protect the Kurds from Saddam Hussein s army. The Syrian side of the border in the region is now under the control of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1

Half of central Congo's 1.5 million displaced people have returned,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Almost half of the 1.5 million people displaced by an insurrection in central Democratic Republic of Congo since last year have returned home as violence has waned in recent months, the United Nations said on Monday. Fighting in central Congo s Kasai region between government forces and militia fighters demanding their withdrawal from the region has killed up to 5,000 people since August of last year. The violence in the usually peaceful center of the country has come amid concern over instability since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate last December.  The election commission said earlier this month that an election to replace Kabila, who came to power after his father s assassination in 2001, will not be possible before April 2019 at the earliest - angering opposition members and raising the prospect of long-term unrest. For now, the situation in Kasai appears to be improving. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a report that 710,000 people had returned to their homes in Kasai, while 762,000 remain displaced. Another 30,000 have fled to neighboring Angola. It did not specify when those people returned home. But in a report on the humanitarian situation last month, it said 1.4 million remained displaced. It added that three million people are in a state of food insecurity in three of the Kasai region s five provinces. Congo s government has devoted considerable resources to stamping out the insurrection by the Kamuina Nsapu militia, which began after Congolese forces killed a local chief who was an outspoken critic of Kabila.  Congolese forces  heavy-handed tactics in suppressing the militia have drawn international condemnation. The United Nations has accused both the government and the militia of carrying out summary executions, and the militia of using child soldiers. The sides both deny such charges. Two U.N. investigators were killed in the region in March while investigating rights abuses.  While violence in Kasai has waned, it has flared in other areas. Militia in eastern Congo s borderlands with Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda have formed new alliances to challenge the central government. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1

Russian radio station says intruder stabs presenter in neck,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - An intruder forced his way into the offices of Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy and stabbed one of the station s anchors in the neck, the broadcaster said on its Internet site on Monday. The intruder, whose motivation was not immediately known, was detained by station security staff and handed over to police. The victim, Tatyana Felgengauer, has been hospitalized but her life is not in danger, the station said. Ekho Moskvy is owned by a media holding ultimately controlled by state-owned gas giant Gazprom. It does however, give air time to journalists and commentators who are fiercely critical of the Kremlin and its allies. One of the station s regular broadcasters, Yulia Latynina, said earlier this year she had been forced to flee Russia after a series of attacks, including the torching of her car. A spokesman for the Russian Prosecutor-General s office, Alexander Kurennoi, said on Facebook the attack was an outrageous act. She said he had assured the station s managers that the situation would be kept under control.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Kenya to charge opposition leader's sister with incitement to violence,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan authorities will arrest and charge the sister of opposition leader Raila Odinga with incitement to violence after attacks on the election board, the chief prosecutor s office said on Monday. Odinga has pulled out of the re-run of an election he was due to contest on Thursday against President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying problems with the election board meant the vote would not be fair. He has called for protests and a boycott and on Sunday said on Twitter there would be  no election .  We resume our picketing at IEBC (election board) offices countrywide on Tuesday and Wednesday. We maintain that there will be no election on Thursday,  he said, without giving details. Kenya is East Africa s richest economy and a trade and transport gateway as well as a hub for diplomacy and security, so its stability is considered vital for the region. Odinga s supporters disrupted a training session for election officials last week in the western city of Kisumu, which is his political stronghold. They attacked election staff and destroyed tents and polling material, witnesses said. Ruth Odinga, who is the opposition leader s sister and a former deputy governor of Kisumu county, was present at the protest, according to Reuters witnesses. Prosecutors instructed police to arrest her, opposition Senator Fred Outa and others. She will be charged with incitement, destruction of property, obstructing election officers and trespassing in an electoral center, according to a letter that the director of public prosecution s office posted online.   The suspects should immediately be charged,  the letter said. Neither Ruth Odinga nor Outa could immediately be contacted for comment. The arrests could anger Odinga s supporters and escalate tension over an election season that has divided the country and led to the deaths of at least 37 people since the first election was held on Aug. 8 including four in the last two weeks. Odinga says the election board had made insufficient reforms to prevent a repeat of the same mistakes that marred the previous presidential polls on Aug. 8. Kenyatta won that election but the Supreme Court last nullified the result, saying there had been procedural irregularities and a repeat must be held. The election board and Kenyatta say the poll will be held regardless of whether Odinga participates. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Germany approves sale of three Thyssenkrupp submarines to Israel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government has approved the sale of three Thyssenkrupp submarines to Israel and will provide financial support for the purchase, government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular news conference on Monday. The estimated $2 billion deal is under police investigation  in Israel over suspected corruption and several public officials and private citizens have been questioned in the case. The 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s personal lawyer also represented Thyssenkrup Marine System s local agent, raising concerns of a conflict of interest. The attorney has denied wrongdoing and said he never discussed the deal with Netanyahu. Israel s justice ministry said in February that Netanyahu himself was not a suspect. Addressing Israel s parliament, Netanyahu told opposition lawmakers that the new deal with Germany helped vindicate him.   How sad for you, that you have been staking your hopes on recycling the submarines story, but also understand that this story, too, has been sunk,  he said.  Seibert said Germany would make a contribution of up to 540 million euros to help finance Israel s purchase. Seibert said an inter-governmental memorandum of understanding approving the deal would be signed later on Monday.  I would like to thank (German) Chancellor (Angela) Merkel and her government for this memorandum, which touches on a matter that is very important for Israel s national security,  Netanyahu said in his speech.

Austrian conservative Kurz says needs more time on coalition talks,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz said on Monday he has yet to decide which party he plans to start coalition talks with, though he was still widely expected to turn to the far-right Freedom Party within days. Having won last week s parliamentary election with 31.5 percent of the vote, Kurz s party is well short of a majority, needing a coalition partner to gain control of parliament and form a stable government. Only two parties have enough seats to do that with   the Social Democrats and the Freedom Party.  It has yet to be decided with whom we want to start negotiations. I will clarify that in the coming hours or days,  Kurz told reporters after a meeting with President Alexander Van der Bellen that many expected to be followed by an announcement on who coalition talks would be held with.  There are certain issues that I would like to discuss again informally or clear up before I start negotiations,  he added, declining to specify what those issues were.

"Slovakia a pro-European island in its region, PM says","BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia s prime minister, president and parliament speaker pledged on Monday to keep to a pro-European path, a day after its Czech neighbors became the latest central European ex-Communists to elect a populist taking a hard line on the EU. Czech billionaire Andrej Babis s ANO party won the vote that punished traditional parties. Babis said on Saturday his party was pro-European but he is cool to adopting the euro single currency and resists deeper integration in the EU. With the election of Babis, the Czechs join the Poles and Hungarians in electing leaders who emphasize national interest and say they are skeptical of greater integration with Europe. Far right parties critical of Brussels have also scored successes in recent weeks in Austria and Germany, notably in Germany s former Communist east.  I never dared to comment on the domestic political situations in other countries, but I am glad that Slovakia has become a pro-European island in this region,  Slovakia s Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Monday. He said it was unintentional but apt timing that the pro-EU foreign policy declaration, which he backed along with President Andrej Kiska and parliament s Speaker Andrej Danko, appeared on the morning after the Czech vote. In power for nine of the past 11 years, Fico has clashed with Brussels himself on many occasions. But he also likes to boast that he increased Slovakia s clout by bringing it into the euro zone in 2009 when its richer Czech neighbors kept their own currency. In recent months, since the election of Emmanuel Macron in France gave a boost to pro-Europeans across the bloc, he has embraced the EU more ardently, saying he aims to steer into a  core  Europe, even if neighbors want to stay on the fringes. Fico, too, is battling a rise in anti-EU sentiment in his country of 5.4 million. But Slovakia, with a small economy driven by exports of cars and electronics to other EU states, has more to lose from alienating Brussels than its bigger and more self-sufficient neighbors.

Widow of Russian major killed in Syria battles for compensation,"SEVASTOPOL, Crimea (Reuters) - Vitalina Bordova received a good morning text message from her husband Sergei, a Russian marine major deployed in Syria. Half an hour later, he was hit by mortar fire that killed him. Since he died on April 18, Bordova has been in dispute with the Russian military, trying to get the financial support she believes she is entitled to as an officer s widow. Bordova described the row with the Defense Ministry in an interview with Reuters, becoming the first relative of a Russian serviceman killed in Syria to complain publicly about her treatment since Russia launched operations there two years ago. The ministry did not reply for a request for comment on the dispute.  Her case shows how the Syrian war is exacting a greater toll on Russians whose lives are touched by it as the conflict changes from a swift anti-terrorist operation to a longer drawn-out engagement.  The true level of casualties in the Syrian conflict is a sensitive subject in a country which was stung by casualties sustained in the Soviet-Afghan war which ended in 1989. According to a Reuters tally, more than 80 Russian fighters, including high-ranking officers and private military contractors, were killed in Syria in the two years of the operation. The official death toll is 39, because the defense ministry does not disclose all deaths. The government has denied understating casualty figures in Syria, where President Vladimir Putin entered the conflict to support President Bashar al-Assad. Officially, Russia is participating only in an air war over Syria with a small number of special forces and non-combat troops on the ground. Moscow denies that its troops are involved in regular ground combat operations. With the conflict drawing on, more people are being affected as the death toll rises. Bordova, who works as a military psychologist, said her wage is 8,600 roubles ($149) per month. She said that she had previously depended on the wages of her 42-year-old husband to survive. To date, she has received a payment of about $17,000   a one-fifth share of compensation that was paid out to her husband s closest relatives   children from his first marriage and his mother.  She has not received the pension to which war veterans  widows are usually entitled, or the apartment to which she argues that she is entitled under Defense Ministry rules. The dispute centers on the fact that she is still officially registered as living in the apartment of her first husband, whom she divorced three years ago. Officials say this means she does not qualify as a person living alone in need of housing support and the pension. However, she argues that this is not the case because she does not live with her first husband, and cannot cash in the share of his apartment which nominally belongs to her. Bordova cannot change her status unless she has her own apartment and only then can she register as living alone.  My wage is very small,  Bordova told Reuters in her parents  house, where she lives with her daughter from her previous marriage.  I have no money for lawyers. My husband supported me.   She described how she had reacted when her husband, bored with a desk job he had just been moved to, said he wanted to sign up for the deployment in Syria.  He asked me if I would let him go,  Bordova recalled.  I said nothing and started crying. Later ... he asked one more time. I told him  I can t keep you from it and I can t let you go ,  Bordova said in the interview. Bordova lives in Crimea, a region of Ukraine that was annexed by Russia in 2014. It was already home to many Russian military families, like Bordova s, before the annexation because Russia s Black Sea Fleet is based there. Reuters has seen an official Russian Defense Ministry response to Bordova, which said she is not eligible for an apartment as she owns one third of her first husband s flat.  Bordova says a benefits office issued her with a document stating she is a family member of a military veteran who was killed. As a person living alone with a child, that would ordinarily entitle her to a widow s pension.  But the certificate was taken back from her once a local official learnt that she is registered with her ex-husband and therefore officially is not living alone. An employee at the benefits office confirmed to Reuters that Bordova is not eligible, citing the law on veterans.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Italian regions start pursuing greater autonomy in shadow of Catalonia crisis,"MILAN/VENICE (Reuters) - Political leaders in northern Italy claimed an overwhelming mandate on Monday to seek greater autonomy from Rome after referendums that did not go as far as the independence vote in Catalonia declared illegal by Spain. Voters in Lombardy and Veneto, both run by the once openly secessionist Northern League, backed the party s autonomy bid by more than 95 percent, although in Lombardy less than half of the electorate turned out. In both regions, many people complain their taxes are wasted by the central government, accusing Rome of delivering low-quality public services and diverting money to the poor south widely seen by northerners as corrupt.  This is the big bang of institutional reforms,  Veneto Governor Luca Zaia told a news conference, announcing plans to begin negotiations on clawing back powers from the central government in 23 policy areas. Regional representatives would be ready to start discussions with Rome in a week, he said.  Unlike the Catalonian referendum, which sparked a political crisis in Spain, the Italian votes were legal, but not binding on Rome. Foreign Affairs Minister Angelino Alfano said the government was ready to negotiate as long as the unity of the nation was not called into question.      Italy s constitution does not allow regional fiscal autonomy, however, and Agriculture Minister Maurizio Martina said that while Rome was open to talks it would not give up tax proceeds from the rich regions. Lombardy, the region of financial hub Milan, accounts for about 20 percent of Italy s economy, which is the euro zone s third largest. Veneto, which includes the tourist magnet Venice, accounts for 10 percent. So any redistribution of tax revenues could have a negative impact on much poorer regions in the south. Lombardy Governor Roberto Maroni said tax was very much on the table.  We can now write a new page: the regions that ask for more power will get it,  he told journalists.  I am talking for example about the power to discuss about tax proceeds that normally go to Rome ... this is the first step in a path towards big reforms.   Voter turnout was around 38 percent in Lombardy and just above 57 percent in Veneto.      The vote is a success for the Lega, Zaia and Maroni. It is an important victory but a dangerous one too,  said Giovanni Orsina, history professor at Rome s Luiss University. The referendums could deepen north-south divisions that pre-date the modern, unified Italian state and many also backfire on the League, a centre-right party that is trying to broaden its appeal beyond the north ahead of national elections next year, Orsina said.

"Islamic State killed more than 60, dozens missing in Syrian town: governor","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Islamic State killed more than 60 civilians and left 100 others missing in a town in Syria s central Homs province over three weeks before the Syrian army recaptured it on Saturday, the provincial governor said. Syrian troops and allied forces regained control of al-Qaryatayn town  after eliminating terrorist Daesh (Islamic State) groups that had infiltrated it,  state media said on Saturday. A Britain-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Islamic State had killed at least 128 people in the town.  Homs province governor Talal Barazi told Reuters by phone that  More than 60 were dead, while more than 100 others are missing, either kidnapped or killed . Searches in the area had uncovered 13 bodies on Sunday, of whom four had been identified, he said.  Barazi said all the civilians who were killed were public employees and pensioners with their families. Earlier this month, the Observatory said IS fighters had seized the town from government forces, part of a counter-attack by the jihadists whose territory in eastern Syria has been whittled down. At least 83 people were killed in the 48 hours before the Syrian army retook the town, the war monitor said, adding that IS had accused the civilians of being  agents of the regime .  Syrian state TV showed Barazi and state officials touring al-Qaryatayn on Monday.  Barazi said that more than 4,000 civilians there needed urgent supplies, and promised restore essential services in the coming few days.       The town lies nearly 300 km (190 miles) west of Deir al-Zor city, the current focus of the government offensive, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, against Islamic State.

"North Korea threat is 'critical, imminent,' Japan tells U.S., South Korea","CLARK FREEPORT ZONE, Philippines (Reuters) - The threat from North Korea has grown to a  critical and imminent level  and the United States, Japan and South Korea must address the matter, Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told his U.S. and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday. Onodera s remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo after North Korean weapons tests, including test firing missiles over Japan, as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.  His comments broke from more measured language on Monday by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-Moo, as the three men met on the sidelines of a gathering of Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.  (The) threat posed by North Korea has grown to the unprecedented, critical and imminent level. Therefore, we have to take calibrated and different responses to meet with that level of threat,  he said, speaking through a translator, at the start of talks in the Philippines.  South Korea s Song also acknowledged that  North Korea s provocative behavior is becoming worse and worse,  in public remarks before reporters were escorted out of the meeting room.  Mattis renewed sharp criticism of North Korea s tests, saying they  threaten regional and global security.  Mattis, who kicked off a week-long trip to the region on Monday, has been eager to emphasize diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully as escalating tension between Washington and Pyongyang stoked fears of  armed confrontation.  Asked about his conversation with Onodera after the two met earlier in the day, before joining South Korea s Song, Mattis said they discussed  maintaining stability and peace in support of the diplomats.  Meanwhile, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said he is willing to travel to North Korea on behalf of the Trump administration to help diffuse the situation, the New York Times reported.   Mattis has been more cautious in his public remarks than U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been locked in a war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, threatening to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and its allies.  Kim has blasted Trump as  mentally deranged.  Mattis is at the start of a week-long trip to Asia and will attend meetings hosted by defense ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the Philippines. ASEAN defense ministers, in a joint statement, expressed  grave concern  over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs and urged the reclusive country to meet its international obligations and resume communications. They underscored the  need to maintain peace and stability in the region  and called  for the exercise of self-restraint and the resumption of dialogue to de-escalate tensions in the Korean peninsula.  Mattis  trip, which will include a stop in Thailand, comes before Trump s first visit to Asia next month, including a stop in China.  Trump has been pressuring China to do more to rein in North Korea s missile and nuclear program. China is North Korea s neighbor and biggest trading partner. Mattis, while in the Philippines, said he will commend the military for defeating insurgents in Marawi City on the islandof Mindanao.  The Philippines said on Monday it has ended five months of military operations in Marawi after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that marked the country s biggest security crisis in years.     Some experts see the Marawi insurgency as a prelude to a more ambitious bid by Islamic State loyalists to exploit Mindanao s poverty and use its jungles and mountains as a base to train, recruit and launch attacks in the region.      It was a tough fight,  Mattis told reporters on his flight to the Philippines, adding he thought the Philippines  military had sent  a very necessary message to the terrorists.      On Thursday, Mattis will lead the U.S. delegation inThailand for the cremation rites for the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Southeast Asian ministers urge North Korea to rein in weapons programs,"CLARK FREEPORT ZONE, Philippines (Reuters) - Southeast Asian defense ministers on Monday expressed  grave concern  over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs and urged the reclusive country to meet its international obligations and resume communications.  North Korea is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland and has ignored all calls, even from its lone major ally, China, to rein in its weapons programs which it conducts in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Defense ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in a joint statement, underscored the  need to maintain peace and stability in the region  and called  for the exercise of self-restraint and the resumption of dialogue to de-escalate tensions in the Korean peninsula . They are due to meet with their counterparts from the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, Russia and New Zealand on Tuesday when North Korea, the disputed South China Sea and terrorism are expected to top the agenda. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said he will talk with Asian allies about North Korea and the crisis caused by its  reckless  provocations. Mattis s trip to Asia, which will also include stops in Thailand and South Korea, comes just weeks before Donald Trump s first visit to Asia as U.S. president. In the same statement, the ministers reiterated the importance of  safety and freedom of navigation in and over-flight above the South China Sea  and called for  self restraint in the conduct of activities . They also vowed to work together to combat terrorism as they condemned the attack by the Maute militant group in the southern Philippine city of Marawi.  The Philippines on Monday announced the end of five months of military operations in Marawi after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that marked the country s biggest security crisis in years.

German 'Reich' extremist given life for killing policeman,"NUREMBERG, Germany (Reuters) - A right-wing extremist member of a group that claims allegiance to Adolf Hitler s World War Two-era German Reich was convicted of murder on Monday for shooting and killing a police officer and sentenced to life in prison. The conviction was handed down amid growing concern in Germany at homegrown right-wing movements that contest the country s post-World War Two democratic order and follows the arrival in parliament this month of the first far-right party in decades. The man, known only as Wolfgang P. because of German court rules, fired through a glazed door on policemen who had arrived to search his flat last October for illegal weapons. One of the officers was killed. The district court in the southern city of Nuremberg found that the shooting had been premeditated, a spokesman said, describing the suspect as  malicious .  He knew that a police officer was stationed in front of this door and wanted to kill him,  said spokesman Friedrich Weitner, describing the court s conclusions. Throughout the trial, P. declined to identify himself to the court, in order to signify his rejection of the German state. The murder led Germany s domestic intelligence agency to start monitoring the Reichsbuerger (Reich Citizens) movement for suspected extremist and unconstitutional activities. The movement, which authorities believe may have up to 900 members, regards the modern German state as illegitimate. Its members say they owe allegiance only to the German Reich, or state, despite its abolition in 1945. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Japan's Abe to push pacifist constitution reform after strong election win,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, buoyed by a huge election win for lawmakers who favor revising Japan s post-war, pacifist constitution, signaled a push towards his long-held goal on Monday but will need to convince a divided public to succeed. Parties in favor of amending the U.S.-drafted charter won nearly 80 percent of the seats in Sunday s lower house election, media counts showed. That left the small, new Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) as the biggest group opposed to Abe s proposed changes. Formed by liberal members of the Democratic Party, which imploded before the election and no longer exists in the lower house, the CDPJ won 55 seats, a final count by public broadcaster NHK shows. That is a fraction of the ruling bloc s two-thirds majority of 313 seats in the 465-member chamber. Abe said he wanted to get other parties on board, including Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike s new conservative Party of Hope, and was not insisting on a target of changing the constitution by 2020 that he floated this year.  We won a two-thirds majority as the ruling bloc, but it is necessary to strive to form a wide-ranging agreement among the ruling bloc and opposition (to revise the constitution),  Abe told a news conference on Monday.  And then we aim to win the understanding of the people, so that we can gain a majority in a referendum,  Abe said. He stopped short of claiming to have won a mandate for amending the constitution in Sunday s election. Amending the charter s pacifist Article 9 would be hugely symbolic for Japan. Supporters see it as the foundation of post-war democracy but many conservatives view it as a humiliating imposition after Japan s defeat in 1945. It would also be a victory for Abe, whose conservative agenda of restoring traditional values, stressing obligations to the state over individual rights and loosening constraints on the military, centers on revising the constitution.  Mr. Abe is trying to create a legacy. His first legacy project was to get the economy out of deflation,  said Jesper Koll, head of equities fund WisdomTree Japan.  The second legacy is to change the constitution,  he said.  You can debate whether he has a mandate but what will make or break him ... is the constitutional issue.  Any revision of the constitution requires support from two-thirds of the members of both chambers of parliament and a majority in a public referendum, with no minimum quorum.  I think that debate in parliament will begin,  said Zentaro Kamei, a senior researcher at think tank PHP Institute and a former lawmaker of Abe s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).   But the reason given for this snap election was Abe s proposal to change what sales tax hike revenues would be used for. If he starts talking about the constitution, people will say,  You didn t ask me that ,  Kamei said. Abe proposed last May adding a clause to Article 9 to legitimize Japan s Self-Defence Force. Read literally, Article 9 bans a standing military but has been interpreted to allow armed forces exclusively for self defense. Parliament enacted laws in 2015 allowing Japan to exercise collective self-defense, or aid allies under attack, based on a reinterpretation of the constitution rather than a formal revision. Critics, including CDPJ leader Yukio Edano, say those laws violate the constitution. The LDP s junior partner, the Komeito, is cautious about revising Article 9, perhaps even more so after signs that some of its dovish supporters had voted for the CDPJ. It also believes the biggest opposition party should agree with the proposed changes. Opinion polls show the public is divided on Abe s proposal. An NHK survey before the election showed 32 percent in favor, 21 percent opposed, and 39 percent unsure. Media exit polls showed that, despite the LDP s big win, 51 percent of voters do not trust the prime minister, a hangover from suspected cronyism scandals that eroded his support this year and a potential risk in case of a referendum.

Japan's Abe vows to put education spending before budget balance,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s prime minister has vowed to make education and childcare a priority over balancing the budget after winning a new mandate from voters on Sunday, as a rapidly-ageing population threatens to undermine his efforts to reflate the economy. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling coalition scored a landslide victory at the polls, boosted by his campaign promises to invest more heavily on education and childcare, aimed partly at encouraging more women to join the workforce. Abe also made clear he would continue to press cautious Japanese firms to spend their record cash piles on boosting employees  wages to stoke a virtuous growth cycle. With his  Abenomics  recipe centered on hyper-easy monetary policy likely to continue, Abe s solid election win also raised expectations he would reappoint Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda in early April when his five-year term expires. Abe's election victory lifted world stocks and the dollar on Monday, sending Japan's Nikkei share average .N225 to 21-year highs. The index ended up 1.1 percent at 21,696.65, up for a record 15th straight session. Abe swept to power in late 2012, pledging to pull Japan s economy, the world s third largest, out of nearly two decades of deflation and stagnation. The economy is recovering gradually but sluggish wage growth keeps consumer spending and inflation from accelerating, while corporations face labor shortages due to a low birth rate and fast-ageing population. The premier promised to offer free pre-school for all children aged three to five and for children aged two or below from low-income households.  The key to Japan s sustainable growth is how we respond to ageing of the population, which is the biggest challenge for Abenomics,  Abe told a news conference.  We aim to exit deflation by accelerating wage growth through innovation on productivity.  If free pre-school education is applied to all children now, it would cost 1.2 trillion yen ($10.54 billion), government estimates show. SMBC Nikko Securities estimates that free pre-school education would relieve households of a financial burden of around 1 trillion yen. If half the reduced cost is spent on consumption, that would push up real gross domestic product by 0.1 percent, the securities firm said. Furthermore, Abe has vowed to expand education benefits with the aim of offering free higher education for low-income households. Abe said he would go ahead with a planned sales tax hike to 10 percent from 8 percent in 2019 and use some of the revenue to create a  social security system for all generations , by diverting the funds to education instead of paying down public debt. The premier had earlier admitted that would make it  impossible  to meet the pledge to balance the primary budget   excluding debt-servicing and new bond sales   by the year ending March 2021. While Abe s plan to spend more on education and childcare has helped buoy stocks of some related companies such as JP-Holdings Inc that operates nursery schools, the specter of bigger spending raises concerns about looser fiscal discipline. Fiscal reform is a matter of urgency. Japan s public debt tops twice the size of its $5 trillion economy, making it the industrial world s heaviest debt burden.  Nonetheless, Abe, who prioritizes growth, has pushed back the primary budget-balancing target without setting a new goal yet, while vowing to compile by the year-end an extra spending plan worth around 2 trillion for human capital investment.  Simply boosting benefits for all generations means politically putting off the pain to future generations, which can be criticized as pork-barrel spending,  said Yasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute.  Diverting sales tax revenue could open the door to expanding fiscal spending further. In order to prevent fiscal discipline from slipping, Japan must continue efforts needed to restore public finances.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Dubai frees Briton sentenced for touching another man: advocacy group,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai s ruler has pardoned a British man a day after he was sentenced to three months in jail for touching another man at a bar, a legal advocacy group said on Monday. Jamie Harron, an electrician working in Afghanistan, was convicted for public indecency after being accused of touching a German man s behind in a bar. Harron, 27, denied the charges and said he brushed past the man by accident as he pushed through the crowded room. The incident at the raucous Rock Bottom bar, popular among Dubai s many wealthy and often tipsy foreign residents and tourists, was reported to police by the accuser.   By special order of the Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Jamie Harron has been freed. The cases against him have been dismissed, and the sentence imposed by the court yesterday has been nullified,  said Detained in Dubai, a group that assists foreigners facing legal problems in the emirate. A Dubai courts spokesman did not immediately respond to Reuters  request for comment. An airlines, business and tourism hub with looser alcohol policies than most Gulf Arab neighbors, Dubai still maintains strict laws against public indecency and homosexuality. Radha Stirling, head of Detained in Dubai, said she hoped cases like Harron s would not happen again.  Of course, a fully functional legal system would not require outside intervention, and a case like Jamie s would never proceed in the first place. But we are enormously grateful to Sheikh Mohammed for stepping in.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
YPG fighters credit Ocalan with Syria victory,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Fighters with the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia have credited Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan with their victory over Islamic State in Raqqa, in apparent response to U.S. criticism of their praise of a man jailed in Turkey for treason. In a video praising Ocalan s  ideological power , the YPG fighters rebuffed U.S. criticism of battle celebrations in Raqqa last week where the YPG s all-female affiliate, the YPJ, unfurled a banner with his face on it.  The banner has become a new focal point for Turkey s anger over U.S. support for the YPG, which Ankara sees as an extension of Ocalan s outlawed Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK). Deeply concerned by the rise of Kurdish power in northern Syria, Turkey has opposed the U.S. alliance with the YPG which spearheaded the Raqqa campaign under the banner of the multi-ethnic Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).  On Saturday, the U.S. embassy in Turkey issued a statement reiterating its misgivings about Ocalan, in an apparent response to criticism from the Turkish government over the banner.  The PKK is listed among foreign terror organizations. Ocalan has been jailed in Turkey for his actions related to the PKK. He is not a person to be respected,  it said. In the video circulated by the YPG press office on Sunday, seven fighters credit Ocalan s ideology for the defeat of Islamic State at Raqqa, which served as the jihadists  Syrian base of operations and a hub for planning attacks in the West.  All victories, developments and gains made here are results of a great battle based on his opinions and philosophy. If his ideological power hadn t been with us, we wouldn t know what to do in such a situation,  said one of the fighters.  Raqqa would never have been rescued from the darkness of recent years, and all other IS occupied cities as well.  Ocalan s influence runs deep in Kurdish-led regions that have emerged in northern Syria since its civil war began in 2011. Steps are under way to establish a new political system based on his ideas about federalism and local democracy.       Another of the fighters, who identified himself as a Canadian and gave his name as Hozan Kobane, said the U.S. government position on Ocalan was  a mistake  and  a bit behind the times .  The writings and the philosophy and the influence of Abdullah Ocalan was very, very decisive in motivating the soldiers with an ideology of peace and democracy that allowed this liberation to be possible,  he said. The U.S.-led coalition has said the Ocalan banner was not sanctioned by the SDF leadership.  Furthermore, the Coalition does not approve of the display of divisive symbols and imagery at a time in which we remain focused on the defeat of Daesh (IS) in Syria,  Colonel Ryan Dillon, the coalition spokesman, said. Ocalan has been in jail in Turkey since 1999 on a treason conviction. More than 40,000 people, most of them Kurds, have died in the fighting since the PKK took up arms against the state in 1984. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1

Toxic fumes keep EU summit venue shut for another week,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The building that houses EU summits, where toxic fumes forced EU leaders to switch venues last week, will be closed for a further week as investigators seek to resolve the problem. The fumes leaking from the drains have forced the Europa Building, also known as  The Egg , to be evacuated twice this month, including before a summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday. The new building was opened in January amid controversy over its 321-million-euro ($378 million) price tag. Staff and meetings will be temporarily transferred to the next door Justus Lipsius building until the issue is resolved. About 20 catering staff had to go to hospital on Oct. 13 and an unspecified number on Wednesday.

"End 'containment' of asylum-seekers on islands, aid groups tell Greek PM","ATHENS (Reuters) - Over a dozen human rights groups and aid organizations wrote to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Monday urging him to end the  containment  of asylum seekers in island camps. More than 13,000 people, mostly Syrians and Iraqis fleeing years of war, are living in five camps on Greek islands close to Turkey, government figures show. Four of those camps are holding two to three times as many people as they were designed for. Those who arrive on Greek islands following a European deal with Turkey last year to stem the flow are forbidden from traveling to mainland until their asylum applications are processed, and those who do not qualify are deported.  Applications have piled up and rulings can take weeks. A recent sharp rise in arrivals has piled additional misery on overcrowded facilities.  The 19 signatories, which include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Rescue Committee and Oxfam, said the islands of Lesbos, Samos, Kos, Chios and Leros had been  transformed into places of indefinite confinement.   We urge you to put an end to the ongoing  containment policy  of trapping asylum seekers on the islands ... and to immediately transfer asylum seekers to the mainland and meet their protection needs,  they wrote.   They described conditions as  abysmal  and said many asylum-seekers lacked access to adequate and timely procedures and protection. Some have been on the islands for 19 months.  Reception conditions are deteriorating, and gaps in basic services, especially medical, are increasing,  they wrote. Thousands of people, including young children, are crammed into tents with only a cloth separating one family from another, the groups said, and conditions were particularly harsh for pregnant women. Nearly 23,000 people have arrived in Greece this year, a fraction compared to the nearly 1 million who arrived in 2015, but state-run camps are struggling to cope with the numbers.   As an emergency measure, the government has said it plans to move about 2,000 people from Samos and Lesbos to the mainland. In recent weeks, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) its research showed a mental health emergency was unfolding in migrant camps on the islands, fueled by poor living conditions, neglect and violence. The United Nations refugee agency called on Greece to speed up preparations at those camps, saying they were ill-prepared for winter. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Residents of Philippines' Marawi begin long trudge back to normalcy as battle ends,"MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Marawi resident Baimona Amintao hopes her turn comes quickly once authorities begin raffling off the first batch of temporary shelters for those who lost their homes to the five-month battle to retake the southern Philippine city from Islamist militants.  Amintao and her five children were among the thousands of families displaced since fighting erupted in Marawi on May 23, when security forces tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon,  Islamic State s  emir  in Southeast Asia.  The Philippines on Monday announced the end of military operations in Marawi after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war in the country s biggest security crisis in years, paving the way for rebuilding and rehabilitation efforts to begin. More than 1,000 transitional houses, with basic bathroom and cooking facilities, could be completed within two months on the outskirts of Marawi, the Philippine housing agency has said. Residents whose homes were devastated will get first priority in allotment raffles that could be held either before or after construction.   I hope I can be included in the raffle and be able to stay there for my children s well-being,  Amintao, 26, who formerly owned a small grocery store, told Reuters.  Many people here prioritize their children since many of the kids cannot stand living inside the tents and are getting sick.  The government estimates the rebuilding of Marawi could cost at least 50 billion pesos ($971 million). Authorities said 920 militants, 165 troops and police and at least 45 civilians were killed in the conflict, which displaced more than 300,000 people. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has placed the southern island of Mindanao, where Marawi is located, under martial rule to help security forces in crushing the rebel movement.     The rebel occupation stunned a military inexperienced in urban combat and stoked wider concerns that Islamic State loyalists have gained influence among local Muslims and have ambitions to use the island as a base for Southeast Asia operations. Those fears are compounded by the organization of the militant alliance and its ability to recruit young fighters, lure foreign radicals, stockpile huge amounts of arms and endure 154 days of ground offensive and air strikes. The social welfare department said more than 5,000 families still live in covered gymnasiums and tent cities.  I could not fathom what happened to our village and I hope this does not happen again,  said Alniah Magoyag, a village official.  No more terrorists in Marawi City.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Russia says Iraqi Kurds must act in concert with Baghdad,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia respects the desire of Iraqi Kurdistan to assert its identity but this must be done in dialogue with the Iraqi government, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday at talks with his Iraqi government counterpart. Relations between Iraqi Kurdistan and the central government in Baghdad have been in crisis since the region held an independence referendum last month. The Iraqi military took back the oil-rich Kirkuk area from Kurdish forces last week.  We understand the hopes of the Kurdish people as it concerns their striving to strengthen their identity, their self-awareness,  Lavrov said at a news conference with Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari.  However, we believe it is correct to realize those desires, those hopes exclusively via the Iraqi government and taking fully into account the significance the Kurdish question has on a regional scale, and taking into account the need to avoid additional sources of instability in the region.  Lavrov was meeting Jaafari days after Russian state oil major Rosneft agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan s main oil pipeline. Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Saturday he had sought clarification from Rosneft. Lavrov said Russia would continue its economic ties with Iraqi Kurdistan, as it does with other constituent parts of Iraq. He said Russia was not closing its consulate in Erbil, the main city in Iraqi Kurdistan, but said the mission was subordinate to the Russian embassy in Baghdad.

"Exclusive: EU dismisses smoke regulation, looks into tougher fire safety tests","BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - There is no need for Europe-wide rules on toxic smoke from building materials, according to a report expected to be signed off by the EU executive over the coming weeks, disappointing campaigners who say regulation is urgently needed following London s deadly Grenfell Tower fire. The European Commission is, however, considering EU-wide fire safety testing for building facades and will conclude a study early next year, according to EU sources, who asked not to be named. Debate on fire safety has intensified since the Grenfell Tower apartment block fire that killed about 80 people in June. An investigation into the fire is underway and it remains unclear what role, if any, smoke played in the tragedy. More generally, firefighters say one of their biggest concerns is smoke because of research linking it to cancer. They also say synthetic materials produce more deadly smoke than natural products.  The responses received do not agree that regulation of toxicity of smoke from construction products is required,  extracts from the final report seen by Reuters showed. It found there was not sufficient evidence that member states want EU-wide smoke regulation and cited concerns it could add to building costs.      There is general agreement that regulation of toxicity of smoke of construction products could increase product costs and potentially remove some products from the market,  is another conclusion. It does not name them. Two sources, who asked not to be named, said the Commission expected to review, finalize and publish the report after the end of this month, but a publication date had yet to be confirmed.  The Commission had asked for the report to help resolve an argument between fire safety campaigners and the plastics industry. Trade body Plastics Europe, which represents companies such as ExxonMobil, Total and BASF, says there is no evidence that rules on smoke would save lives and there are multiple factors to consider when assessing a building s safety.  Toxicity criterion for construction products will not per se guarantee more safety in the eventuality of a fire,  Plastics Europe said in a position paper. The European Commission declined to comment. Firefighters and other safety campaigners say labeling products according to their toxicity when burned would address a lack of clear fire safety regulations for builders.  Had the construction products regulation incorporated fire toxicity into the product labeling, it would have been very clear to the architects and designers that they were putting the occupants of Grenfell in danger,  said Richard Hull, a professor of fire science at the University of Central Lancashire in England. For now, the EU only sets standards to ensure construction materials can be shipped across borders within the bloc, although EU sources said the Commission decided long before the Grenfell fire to draw up the planned rules to harmonise fire-safety tests for building facades. In addition, the Grenfell Tower fire led the Commission to set up a Fire Information Exchange Platform to share safety information among member states. It met in Brussels for the first time on Oct. 16. Sian Hughes, chair of Fire Safe Europe, said harmonized testing for facades would be a step forward but for high-rise buildings it was impossible for any test to accurately predict a real-life fire.  We must design the risk out of these buildings and that means only permitting non-combustible materials in these buildings from the start,  she said. Fire Safe Europe brings together fire fighters, representatives of the concrete and cable industries, and equipment and insulation companies including Danish-listed Rockwool and Germany s Knauf Insulation.  It says around 40 percent of deaths in fires are caused directly by smoke, while a further 20 percent are caused by a combination of severe burns and smoke. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
"Go home, Tillerson tells Iranian-backed militias in Iraq","RIYADH/DOHA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday it was time for Iranian-backed militias and their Iranian advisers who helped Iraq defeat Islamic State to  go home , after a rare joint meeting with the leaders of Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The United States is concerned that Iran, a Shi ite regional power, will take advantage of gains against IS in Iraq and Syria to expand the influence it gained after the U.S. invasion in 2003, something Sunni Arab rivals such as Riyadh also oppose.  Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against Daesh and ISIS is coming to a close, those militias need to go home. The foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home and allow the Iraqi people to regain control,  Tillerson said at a joint news conference with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir. Tens of thousands of Iraqis heeded a call to arms in 2014 after IS seized a third of the country s territory, forming the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), which receive funding and training from Tehran and have been declared part of the Iraqi security apparatus. A senior U.S. official said Tillerson had been referring to the PMF and the Quds Force, the foreign paramilitary and espionage arm of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif berated Tillerson s remarks as influenced by Iran s oil-rich regional rival Saudi Arabia.  Exactly what country is it that Iraqis who rose up to defend their homes against ISIS return to?,  Zarif said in a tweet.  Shameful US FP (foreign policy), dictated by petrodollars.  Iraq s military, armed by the United States but supported by the PMF, ejected the ultra-hardline Sunni Muslim militant group from Mosul and other cities in northern Iraq this year. Several thousand U.S. troops are still in the country, mostly for training but also to carry out raids against IS. The campaign to uproot the militants left whole cities in ruins and has hit Iraq s economy. A new joint ministerial-level body between Iraq and Saudi Arabia convened its inaugural meeting earlier on Sunday to coordinate their fight against IS and on rebuilding Iraqi territory wrested from the group. Jubeir emphasized historic ties between the two neighbors, which share a border, vast oil resources and many of the same tribes.  The natural tendency of the two countries and people is to be very close to each other as they have been for centuries. It was interrupted for a number of decades. We re trying now to make up for lost ground,  he said. The rare senior meeting, signaling a thaw between states that have been at loggerheads for decades, was also attended by Saudi King Salman and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. Tillerson said the council would contribute to reforms to build Iraq s private sector and encourage foreign investment.  This will be critical to winning the peace that has been earned through the hard-fought military gains,  he said. State media said the council had expressed satisfaction with global oil markets  recovery as a result of a deal with other countries to boost prices by limiting production. The council also agreed to reopen a Saudi Basic Industries Corp office in Iraq and grant Saudi agriculture company SALIC an investment license. A second meeting will be held in Baghdad but no date was mentioned. Saudi Commerce and Investment Minister Majid al-Qusaibi told Reuters his country seeks to boost exports and is eyeing investment opportunities in Iraq s agricultural and petrochemical sectors, among others. He said backing from the highest levels of both governments would produce  quick results on the ground .  Let s not cry over spilt milk. Whatever happened in the past has happened. The good news is we are all here toward building a prosperous and beneficial future for both countries,  he said in a telephone interview. Tillerson and Jubeir also discussed Washington s hawkish new policy towards Iran, including a possible withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and new sanctions on the IRGC.  Both our countries believe those who conduct business with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, any of their entities, European companies or other companies around the world really do so at great risk,  Tillerson said. Relations between Riyadh and Baghdad were cut for 25 years, before recent rapprochement, after former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates, is wooing Baghdad now in an effort to halt the growing regional influence of Iran. Arriving in Doha later on Sunday for the next leg of a multi-country trip, Tillerson told a news conference that there was little chance of a swift breakthrough to resolve a blockade imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies. The kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain imposed trade and travel curbs on Doha in June for alleged support of terrorism and friendship with Iran - charges Qatar denies.  There is not a strong indication that the parties are ready to talk yet,  Tillerson said. The secretary of state s six-day trip will also take him to Pakistan, India and Switzerland.

Iraq dismisses U.S. call for Iranian-backed militias to 'go home',"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Iraqi government has dismissed a call from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for Iranian-backed paramilitary units that helped Baghdad defeat Islamic State to end operations in Iraq. Speaking after a meeting on Sunday with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Saudi Arabia s King Salman, Tillerson said it was time for the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation forces and their Iranian advisers to  go home . Washington, which backed Baghdad against Islamic State, is concerned Iran will use its expanded presence in Iraq and in Syria to expand its influence in the region.   But Abadi showed unwillingness to meet Tillerson s demand.  No party has the right to interfere in Iraqi matters,  the statement from his office read. It did not cite the prime minister himself but a  source  close to him. Trained and armed by Iran, the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation forces often supported Iraqi government units in the fight against the militants who were effectively defeated in July when a U.S.-backed offensive captured their stronghold Mosul. They are paid by the Iraqi government and officially report to the prime minister, but some Arab Sunni and Kurdish politicians describe these militias as a de facto branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corp. Iraq s Sunni neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, share Washington s concerns over Shi ite power Iran s influence in Iraq, where the population is also predominantly Shi ite. But the office of Abadi, himself a Shi ite, said the forces were under the authority of the Iraqi government.  Popular Mobilisation are Iraqi patriots,  it said in the statement. The United States trained tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers in the course of rebuilding the Iraqi armed forces and has over 5,000 troops deployed in the country, providing key air and ground support to the offensive on Islamic State.

Trump's tougher stance could backfire by boosting Iran's Guards,"ANKARA/LONDON (Reuters) - Iran s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a military force with political clout and an industrial empire, stands to benefit from heightened tension between Washington and Tehran, officials and analysts said. President Donald Trump broke ranks with other major powers earlier this month by disavowing Iran s compliance with a 2015 multinational nuclear deal, complicating life for foreign investors nervous of possible new U.S. sanctions. The IRGC, which reports directly to Iran s Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, began rapidly expanding its commercial interests a decade ago, before U.S. and EU sanctions were imposed on Iran s oil and finance sectors in 2012 over the country s nuclear program. It controls businesses ranging from ports management to telecommunications and has made the most of both cooling and warming ties with the West. When Western oil companies vacated energy projects in Iran after 2012, the Guards took them on; after the penalties were lifted in 2016, the IRGC, through front companies, served as a conduit for foreign business flowing into Iran. If investors are put off again, the IRGC is ready to step in, said an official from Khamenei s camp.  We want foreign investors to stay, but if they leave because of (U.S.) pressure, the Guards can easily replace them. There is no better alternative,  the official said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media. Under sanctions, Iran s clerical rulers rewarded the Guards by showering them with contracts for skirting the restrictions as well as for suppressing dissent at home and helping Tehran s regional allies from Iraq to Lebanon. The IRGC s lack of technical expertise and concern over the viability of its economic ventures under sanctions meant it later welcomed pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani s deal that eased sanctions in return for curbs on the nuclear program. Khamenei, a hardliner who holds ultimate authority on matters of state in Iran, guardedly endorsed the nuclear accord but has said Rouhani s economic follow-through has fallen short. To bypass existing unilateral U.S. sanctions, which bar any business with the Guards and its affiliated firms, many of the IRGC s front companies are not even formally owned by the Guards, but by individuals and firms linked to it.  Rouhani has tried to encourage reluctant major European firms and banks to return to Iran by seeking to curb the Guards  involvement in the economy, which led to the IRGC transferring ownership of some companies to the state. In recent months, the IRGC, which sees itself as a bulwark against Western influence, has responded by criticizing Rouhani for viewing foreign countries as the key to economic growth.  The IRGC will be the main beneficiary of the tension with Washington ... In order to protect its economic dominance, the  IRGC prefers only limited opening to the West,  said a Western diplomat who follows Iran closely. While backing the nuclear deal, Europeans share Washington s concern over Iran s ballistic missile program and  destabilizing  regional behavior. The IRGC has vowed to accelerate the disputed missile program and Iran s Shi ite militia proxies have made big military gains in recent months in Syria and Iraq, part of a decades-old tussle for influence in the Middle East with Sunni powers. Tehran emphasizes its role in battling Islamic State. Many foreign firms remain hesitant to invest in Iran for reasons including lingering unilateral U.S. sanctions imposed over human rights violations and alleged Iranian links to terrorism, and the dominant role of the IRGC in the Middle East s second largest economy. Among European firms that have announced big deals in Iran since last year are planemaker Airbus AIR.PA, French energy group Total TOTF.PA, and Germany s Siemens SIEGn.DE. Planemaker Boeing is the only U.S. company that has been granted direct access to the Iranian market with a deal to sell 110 plans to two Iranian carriers.  But Trump s hawkish new approach towards Tehran, coupled with banking worries and domestic political turbulence in both countries, are causing growing uncertainty over Iran s plane deals. Iranian officials have acknowledged publicly that major international companies are still wary of providing finance for Iran-related business, fearing potential fines resulting from existing U.S. sanctions, which include a ban on dollar related trade with the country. Iran needs the equivalent of billions of dollars in investment to revitalize industries including oil and gas and develop sectors held back by a lack of Western financing and the wide economic influence of the IRGC. These factors have all added to the difficulties faced by foreign investors looking to tap Iran s market.      The commercial issue is the turbulence that Trump creates,  Andreas Schweitzer, managing director with London-based M&A and investment advisory firm Arjan Capital Ltd, which has been investing in Iran since 2009. He said transactions were nevertheless still taking place, including in the automotive, energy and industrial sectors, in the one hundred million to two hundred million euros sphere. Merger and acquisition deals were among them, he said.  We keep the same mindset as of 2009   we assume the worst case, including that the Revolutionary Guards could be sanctioned, although we don t deal with them and if sanctioned parties are involved somewhere we won t touch the transaction or the company. We are and remain very cautious and so far we never have had a problem.  Following Trump s speech, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he planned to impose new sanctions on the Guards and would work with international counterparts on the issue. Charles Blackmore, chief executive of London-based due diligence specialists Audere International, which is active in Iran, said the policy shift by Washington would have  an adverse effect upon the more risk adverse investor .  For those who are already invested and know the country well, this will not make a blind bit of difference,  he said.      There are enough issues at the moment making people aware of how much of the economy is controlled by shadow shareholdings and opaque structures of the IRGC.      The survival of the nuclear deal is up to the U.S. Congress, which has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose broad sanctions on Iran. The U.S. administration has said Washington will not stand in the way of European trade and business transactions with Iran. Matthew Oresman, counsel with law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, who advises companies on Iran compliance issues, said Washington had considerable power and leverage to disrupt trade with Iran if that served its national security interests.  But the European governments have ways to dampen this and protect their businesses if they so desire,  he said.

Tanzania president names tax expert as central bank governor,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania s new central bank governor will be tax law professor Florens Luoga, the country s president said on Monday. President John Magufuli said Luoga would take over in December or January after the tenure of current governor Benno Ndulu expires.  I have decided to appoint a new (central bank) governor from among members of the committees that investigated the mining sector,  Magufuli said. He was speaking at a ceremony to award certificates of recognition to members of two presidential committees that investigated allegations of tax evasion in exports of gold and copper concentrate in the east African country. Luoga currently serves as the deputy vice chancellor of the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), the country s largest public university.  In July he was also appointed by Magufuli as chairman of the board of directors of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA).  Magufuli said he was aware many people expected him to appoint an economist as next governor. But  Luoga is a professor of taxation law and he will help us strengthen checks on capital flight by some foreign companies that use tax havens.  President Magufuli s government accuses mining firms of cheating Tanzania out of its fair share of mineral wealth through tax dodging and smuggling, allegations they deny. Magufuli ordered the country s central bank to crackdown on capital flight by foreign investors companies. The country s new Minister of Minerals, Angellah Kairuki, speaking at the same function, said the government was determined to  plug all loopholes in the mining sector, including the smuggling of minerals.

"In Liberian slum, residents demand change from next president","MONROVIA (Reuters) - Crammed into tumble-down shacks on a sandspit that the Atlantic Ocean is steadily devouring, the residents of Liberia s most notorious slum have one common desire: an end to their daily struggle with dire poverty. Next month, when the 75,000 inhabitants of the capital Monrovia s West Point neighborhood decide who should be the next leader of Africa s oldest republic, an ex-soccer star or the current vice president, they will not be nostalgic.  The last president didn t give any help to the common people - no improvement, no development,  said Ishmael Campbell, a 26-year-old fisherman born and raised in the shantytown.  We need a president who will be there for us.   While the world has feted President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, for keeping the peace after a prolonged civil war, those living in West Point take a dimmer view of her 12-year tenure. Like most in West Point, Campbell lives in a shack along one of the labyrinthine back alleys where houses are packed so close that residents must squeeze through shoulder-wide paths choked by rotting fish and sewage. On Johnson Sirleaf s watch, an Ebola epidemic saw them placed under quarantine, hemmed in by barbed wire and soldiers who opened fire on protesters challenging the order. Then a global commodities crash dashed the country s hopes of mining riches. The economy quadrupled in size, thanks in large part to the fact that peace prevailed, but Johnson Sirleaf was criticized for failing to curb corruption. The two candidates through to the Nov. 7 runoff election, George Weah, a former FIFA world player of the year, and Vice President Joseph Boakai, must persuade struggling voters across the West African nation that they can make a difference. Though representing the ruling party, Boakai has presented himself as the candidate for change, playing up his humble beginnings in a bid to distance himself from the tinted-windows government elite despised by the poor. Neither he nor Johnson Sirleaf are seen as corrupt, but Boakai has been nicknamed  sleepy Joe  for falling asleep at public functions and few are buying his message in West Point.  He doesn t care about us, he just cares about himself, Campbell said. West Point, where jobs are few and many residents spend the hot afternoons playing checkers or fixing fishing lines in the shade, is a Weah stronghold.  The youth are on the streets, but they want to work,  said Eugene Nyuti, 35.  George Weah is going to empower the youth.  Weah is a senator and has been goodwill ambassador for UNICEF; many Liberians call him  the ambassador . His policies are vague, although he says he wants to improve the country s roads, and critics say he lacks political experience, but he won a clear lead in the first round of the election, with 38 percent of the vote to Boakai s 28 percent. West Point s problems are echoed to varying degrees across Liberia, which has relied heavily on international donor support since the end of the war in 2003.  The state-run Liberia Electricity Corporation struggles to generate enough revenue to erect more power lines. Thousands across Monrovia illegally connect to the grid with crude wires.  Still, West Point stands out. Asked about their most desperate need, residents point to the rubbish-strewn ocean that laps at their homes. Old sand bags and tires have not stopped the problem. Houses regularly slide into the sea. Towards evening as Joseph Myame, 25, watched fishermen roll their wooden canoes onto the beach, he too is praying for a Weah victory.   Maybe he can make a bit of a difference. But whoever wins, the problems are too big.  ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
"Typhoon leaves flooding, four dead in Japan before moving out to sea","TOKYO (Reuters) - A rapidly weakening typhoon Lan made landfall in Japan on Monday, setting off landslides and flooding that prompted evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people, but then headed out to sea after largely sparing the capital, Tokyo. Four people were reported killed, hundreds of plane flights  canceled, and train services disrupted in the wake of Lan, which had maintained intense strength until virtually the time it made landfall west of Tokyo in the early hours of Monday.  At least four people were killed, including a man who was hit by falling scaffolding, a fisherman tending to his boat, and  a young woman whose car had been washed away by floodwaters. Another casualty was left comatose by injuries and a man was missing, NHK public television said. Around 130 others suffered minor injuries. Rivers burst their banks in several parts of Japan and fishing boats were tossed up on land. A container ship was stranded after being swept onto a harbor wall but all 19 crew members escaped injury. Some 80,000 people in Koriyama, a city 200 km (124 miles) north of Tokyo, were ordered to evacuate as a river neared the top of its banks, NHK said, but by afternoon water levels were starting to fall. Several hundred houses in western Japan were flooded.  My grandchild lives over there. The house is fine, but the area is flooded, and they can t get out,  one man told NHK. Lan had weakened to a category 2 storm when it made landfall early on Monday, sideswiping Tokyo, after powering north for days as an intense category 4 storm, according to the Tropical Storm Risk monitoring site. Lan is the Marshall islands word for  storm . By Monday afternoon the storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression and it was in the Pacific, east of the northernmost main island of Hokkaido, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.  Around 350 flights were canceled and train services disrupted over a wide area of Japan, although most commuter trains were running smoothly in Tokyo.  Toyota Motor Corp canceled the first shift at all of its assembly plants but said it would operate the second shift as normal. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1

"Six police wounded, one killed in shootings near Indonesia's Freeport mine","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Six police were wounded and one killed in shootings that police alleged on Monday were carried out by a separatist group that aims to disrupt operations at the Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia s eastern-most province of Papua.  Four of the shootings took place on Monday, while police were already investigating incidents that occurred over the weekend, including the fatal shooting of an officer in Timika on Sunday afternoon.  The armed group police say is behind the shootings has up to 30  separatist  members led by a man named Sabinus Waker.  The group has carried out earlier shootings in the mine area as well, Papua Police spokesman Suryadi Diaz told Reuters.       It s clear they want to disrupt operations at Freeport,  Diaz said.  Diaz said the group is  demanding justice  from the local unit of Freeport-McMoRan Inc, which operates the Grasberg mine, although it was not clear what that might entail.   Freeport is rich (and) has a big company. The population are poor,  Diaz said. It was not immediately possible to contact Waker, and it is not known if the group that police say is led by him has a spokesman or other representative.  A spokesman for Freeport s Indonesian unit said the recent shootings have had no impact on output from Grasberg, the world s second-biggest copper mine, but he declined to comment further.  Pro-independence rebels in Papua have waged a low-level conflict for decades, raising major concerns over security at Grasberg. Between 2009 and 2015, shootings within the mine project area killed 20 people and wounded 59.  To protect workers and infrastructure, Freeport contributed $21 million toward government-provided security in 2015.  Freeport has been grappling with labor problems at Grasberg and a lengthy dispute with Indonesia over rights to the giant mine that has cost both sides hundreds of millions of dollars.

Cambodian PM says main opposition party will be dissolved,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said on Monday it was  a fact  that the main opposition party would be dissolved as he spoke on the anniversary of the peace agreement that established multiparty democracy. More than 50 rights groups called on the countries that signed the Paris Peace Agreements in 1991 to reconvene urgently because of the threat to democracy in the Southeast Asian country. Hun Sen s government has asked the supreme court to dissolve the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) after its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested on Sept. 3 and charged with treason. The court has yet to rule on whether the CNRP will be dissolved.  Because they didn t respect the Paris Peace Agreement, the political party will be dissolved in the future, this is a fact,  Hun Sen said at a ceremony marking the construction of a new bridge in Phnom Penh. Dissolving the party would eliminate the challenge to him prolonging more than 32 years in power in next year s election, but Western donors have criticized the move and called for the release of Kem Sokha. Hun Sen accused the United Nations of failing to bring peace despite organizing the first election in 1993 and said guerrilla fighting had only ended because of his own negotiations with leaders of the genocidal Khmer Rouge. Hun Sen s critics accuse him of trying to turn the country into a one-party state for the ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP). On Sunday, he said any elected officials who defect from the CNRP to his party would be allowed to keep their positions once the opposition party is dissolved. In a joint open letter on Monday, more than 50 rights groups called for the Paris Conference on Cambodia to be reconvened.  There is an urgent need for decisive action from the international community, to ensure that the democratic vision for Cambodia outlined in the Paris Peace Agreements is not completely forsaken,  said the letter. Hun Sen said calls for the original signatories to be reconvened were  out of date and impossible . He noted that one of the signatories, the Soviet Union, no longer exists. In the face of the Western criticism since the arrest of Kem Sokha, China has given verbal support to Hun Sen s government. China is by far the biggest donor to Cambodia and its biggest investor. China s influential Global Times tabloid said in an editorial on Sunday that Cambodia s  growth trend should not be interrupted by the country s rising political tension .  As an important economic partner of Cambodia, China will pay close attention to the situation in the Southeast Asian country and willingly provide the necessary help,  it said.

'Nowhere to hide': North Korean missiles spur anxiety in Japan fishing town,"ERIMO, Japan (Reuters) - Ever since North Korea lobbed two missiles far above this windswept fishing town on Japan s northern island of Hokkaido, seaweed farmer Mitsuyo Kawamura says she s been on edge.  Now when I hear a loud sound, I look outside, I look out at the ocean,  68-year-old Kawamura said from her seaside cottage in Erimo, where she lays out long dark strands of kombu seaweed on stones to dry in the sun.  I feel anxious, like I never know when it will come again.  As Japan prepares to vote in Sunday s national election,   Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called North Korea s escalating threats   it also conducted a sixth nuclear test last month   a  national crisis  that only he can lead Japan through. Yet the missiles that flew over Erimo on Aug. 29 and Sept. 15 created an eerie threat: No one saw or heard them. They streaked by several hundred kilometers above land, too high to see with the naked eye, before splashing into the Pacific more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) to the east.  Warnings of the missiles spread through sirens and government-issued  J-alerts  on millions of cell phones throughout Japan, jolting some out of sleep. Kawamura has since stocked up on extra food and keeps the radio on to listen for more warnings. Like many residents here   and across Japan   she feels helpless, unsure of how to protect herself.  When it s launched, it could land here just moments later,  she said.  There s nowhere to hide.  Abe s rhetoric has grown harsher as North Korea has threatened to  sink  Japan and seems intent on developing nuclear warheads that can reach the U.S. mainland. He has repeatedly backed U.S. President Donald Trump s  all-options-on-the-table  stance and says now is not the time for dialogue.  They promised in 1994 and again in 2005 that they would abandon their nuclear program. But they have broken their word and developed nuclear devices and missiles,  Abe said at a campaign rally last week.  We re not going to be deceived anymore.  To protect itself, Japan has deployed 34 Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries around the country, including one in Hokkaido, and Aegis defense systems on several destroyers. U.S. forces in Japan also have ballistic missile defense equipment that can   if all goes well   take out a missile in mid-flight. The rockets thrust tiny Erimo, population 4,850, into the global spotlight. Maps on TV broadcasts showed the missiles  flight paths over nearby Cape Erimo, a jagged point that juts into the Pacific where seals frolic. At the town s docks, where fishermen sorted through the morning s haul of salmon, tossing them into vats of ice water, strong support for Abe was mixed with worries that he s too strident, putting Japan at risk.  Right now, no one s better than Abe,  said Satoru Narita, a 72-year-old fisherman. If anything, Japan has been too passive, said 23-year-old Ryosuke Kinoshita, who supports Abe s ruling Liberal Democratic Party.  Next time they launch one, I d almost like to see us fire one back,  he said.  We can t live in peace and safety.  But Haruki Suminoya, head of Erimo s fishing union, cautioned that being overly aggressive could provoke North Korea  into lashing out.  Abe s approach is too strong, too hardline,  he said.  A more restrained approach is better.  The recent war of words between Trump and North Korea unsettled many residents, who pointed out they were a much closer target than the United States. While pressure was needed toward North Korea, being too tough could be disastrous, said Mayor Masaki Ohnishi.  If North Korea does something serious, Japan is within shooting range.  So far, it seems that Abe is winning over voters. Nationwide polls show the LDP is headed for a big win this weekend. Erimo residents were divided on Abe s signature policy of  revising Japan s war-renouncing constitution to clarify the status of the country s military. Critics worry that it could lead to an expanded role for the armed forces overseas and entangle it in U.S.-led conflicts. But Shinto priest Hirotaka Tezuka, 39, said the constitution had grown outdated.  We need a constitution that s better suited to the present era.  Yoshihiro Naito, 77, opposed the idea.  The commitment we ve made not to wage war has kept Japan safe.  He plans to vote for an opposition party because he thinks Abe and the LDP have become too powerful.  Town officials said they have not taken any particular precautionary steps following the recent missile launches, nor do they plan any  duck and cover  drills that have been held elsewhere. The town has loud speakers on 50 tall poles to broadcast warnings for tsunamis, typhoons   and now missiles. In recent months, they have installed wireless units in 1,500 of the 2,200 homes so people can hear them when they are indoors.  Erimo also has emergency stocks of food, water and other supplies, the mayor said. That s particularly important for Erimo because it is linked to the rest of Hokkaido by only one coast-hugging road, which gets closed several times a year due to heavy rains or massive waves. Local fishermen are nervous about North Korea s warning that it might conduct a hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific, which they worry would contaminate the water like the Fukushima nuclear disaster did in 2011.  The radiation would make all the fish inedible,  said Narita, the elderly fisherman.  Like in Fukushima, we couldn t do our jobs.  The town s dwindling fishing industry has already been hit hard by a plunge in the salmon catch as well as by a dearth of youngsters to take over the trade. When young people move away to cities such as Sapporo, Hokkaido s capital, sometimes their parents follow them, residents said. Erimo s population, which peaked above 9,000 in the 1960s, has fallen to nearly half that level.  We re a fishing town,  said Naito,  so if we can t catch fish any more, we re finished.

U.S. carrier patrols off Korean peninsula in warning to Pyongyang,"ABOARD USS RONALD REAGAN, Sea of Japan (Reuters) - The USS Ronald Reagan, a 100,000-ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier, patrolled in waters east of the Korean peninsula on Thursday, in a show of sea and air power designed to warn off North Korea from any military action. The U.S. Navy s biggest warship in Asia, with a crew of 5,000 sailors, sailed around 100 miles (160.93 km), launching almost 90 F-18 Super Hornet sorties from its deck, in sight of South Korean islands. It is conducting drills with the South Korean navy involving 40 warships deployed in a line stretching from the Yellow Sea west of the peninsula into the Sea of Japan.  The dangerous and aggressive behavior by North Korea concerns everybody in the world,  Rear Admiral Marc Dalton, commander of the Reagan s strike group, said in the carrier s hangar as war planes taxied on the flight deck above.  We have made it clear with this exercise, and many others, that we are ready to defend the Republic of Korea.   The Reagan s presence in the region, coupled with recent military pressure by Washington on Pyongyang, including B1-B strategic bomber flights over the Korean peninsula, comes ahead of President Donald Trump s first official visit to Asia, set to start in Japan on Nov. 5, with South Korea to follow. North Korea has slammed the warship gathering as a  rehearsal for war . It comes as senior Japanese, South Korean and U.S. diplomats meet in Seoul to discuss a diplomatic way forward backed up by U.N. sanctions.     The U.N. Security Council has unanimously ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes since 2006. The most stringent include a ban on coal, iron ore and seafood exports that aim at halting a third of North Korea s $3 billion of annual exports. On Monday, Kim In Ryong, North Korea s deputy U.N. envoy, told a U.N. General Assembly committee the Korean peninsula situation had reached a touch-and-go point and a nuclear war could break out at any moment.  A series of weapons tests by Pyongyang, including its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 and two missile launches over Japan, has stoked tension in East Asia. A Russian who returned from a visit to Pyongyang has said the regime is preparing to test a missile it believes can reach the U.S. west coast. On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said President Donald Trump had instructed him to continue diplomatic efforts to defuse tension with North Korea.  Washington has not ruled out the eventual possibility of direct talks with the North to resolve the stand-off, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said on Tuesday.

Now talk nice: EU script to help May settle Brexit bill,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Diplomatic theatrics at last week s Brussels summit revealed how European Union leaders will coax British Prime Minister Theresa May over the next two months into parting with tens of billions of euros in return for a post-Brexit trade deal. May gave away nothing hardliners in her Conservative cabinet can beat her with. She stuck to earlier vague concessions about honoring commitments and insisting a  Brexit bill , which the EU reckons at around 60 billion euros ($70 billion), must be part of a package deal on what Britain s relationship with the EU will be once it leaves in March 2019. Sticking to their own script, the other 27 states gave May until the next regular summit in eight weeks to improve an offer officials estimate at about 20 billion euros if she wants them to start discussing future trade ties. Miss that deadline and, the EU says, time will be running out for any deal. Yet between the lines of well-rehearsed arguments that have hit  deadlock  in the view of the EU negotiator, the outlines of a political fix are emerging. It may create leeway to get round an impasse that is in neither side s interest and which has left businesses fearing the legal limbo of a messy divorce. In essence, the 27 need to trust May that Britain will pay much more than is on the table but understand her difficulties in naming a figure by December, which could spark revolt at home and derail the process. In return, they seem likely to let slip more hints of what kind of future relationship she might secure. The EU position is  solid , Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told reporters after the talks, but also  flexible . It was unrealistic, he said, to expect May to sell a precise demand for money in December. Equally, she could not expect the EU to negotiate a future trade deal without knowing roughly what outstanding items Britain would pay for. But defining those items could, Gentiloni said, be done  in the most politically manageable way possible for our British friends . Even the roughest of definitions will let commentators work out numbers. But as a senior diplomat from another major EU power put it:  We don t want to go public with a bald figure. If it s on the front page of The Sun, the whole process is dead.  Underlining a growing appreciation of May s limited room for maneuver, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was quoted in a German newspaper on Sunday as telling aides he found May  despondent  when they met last Monday, beset by party coup plots and asking Europeans to help her out.  Aware of her troubles, EU leaders accentuated the positive.  Reports of the deadlock ... have been exaggerated,  summit chair Donald Tusk concluded, adding that discussions with May had finally succeeded in  establishing trust and goodwill .  Tusk, a former Polish premier, echoed the EU mantra of unity among the 27 and full backing for European Commission negotiator Michel Barnier, whose team of technical experts are handling the talks with London. But he also acknowledged a nuance in his role in steering the high-level political imperatives of the leaders. That, Tusk said, meant he would be a  positive motivator  in the coming weeks to create  a more positive narrative  than what some British politicians call EU  blackmail  demands. Anxious not to worsen May s troubles at home, fellow leaders made an effort to demonstrate goodwill. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron take a hard line on  sequencing  divorce talks before trade, but they huddled with May in amicable conversation for television cameras. The EU communique acknowledged progress on key issues, which also comprise expatriate rights and the Irish border, and instructed Barnier to begin internal EU preparations for the talks May wants on a two-year transition period after Brexit. Tusk said EU preparations would  take account of proposals presented  by  our British friends    an indication that, even without direct talks, May might be able to show her domestic audience an outline of how the EU sees future ties. Over dinner on Thursday, she appealed for help and stressed two concessions made in a speech at Florence on Sept. 22   that the 27 would not lose out financially in the current EU budget ending in 2020 and that Britain would  honor its commitments . Some were disappointed that she repeated Britain s rejection of the legal basis of much of the EU s demands, notably that it pay for EU commitments lasting beyond 2020. Macron, for one, said they were  not even half way  toward an agreement on money. But others detected a more positive tone. Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said May had indicated that Britain was at least  analyzing  what other parts of the bill it might pay. Merkel said she had  no doubt  a good agreement was possible. Yet there are few illusions that the Brexit plot will play out smoothly.  We ve always predicted a drama for autumn,  one EU diplomat said.  We haven t seen it yet. So maybe November.  ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Malaysia asks Interpol to trace financier linked to 1MDB scandal,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has asked Interpol to try to locate a Malaysian financier for questioning over his suspected involvement in a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the deputy prime minister said on Monday. The U.S. Justice Department is seeking to seize $1.7 billion in assets that it said were bought with misappropriated funds from 1MDB, according to dozens of civil lawsuits filed by the department in the past two years.  The assets include a private jet, a hotel and real estate in New York, and a $107 million interest in EMI Music Publishing bought by Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, the lawsuits said.  Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, has not been charged with any crime. But U.S. authorities have said they are pursuing a criminal probe into 1MDB-linked transactions.      We are confident Interpol will act professionally, but the police have yet to receive any detailed information (on Low s whereabouts),  Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said in parliament. A spokesman for Low could not be reached for comment. Low has previously denied any wrongdoing, saying that the U.S. Justice Department s actions were  a further example of global overreach in pursuit of a deeply flawed case . Interpol did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  1MDB, founded by Prime Minister Najib Razak, is facing money laundering probes in at least six countries including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to the U.S. lawsuits.  Low is accused in the lawsuits of using 1MDB-linked funds to buy Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio a $3.2 million Picasso painting, and giving about $9 million in jewelry to Australian model Miranda Kerr. DiCaprio and Kerr have turned over the items to U.S. authorities and promised to cooperate in the 1MDB probe. The lawsuits also said $681 million from 1MDB was transferred to the account of  Malaysian Official 1 , which U.S. and Malaysian sources have previously identified as Najib. Najib has denied any wrongdoing and a Malaysian government investigation has also cleared him of any wrongdoing. A Malaysian police probe into 1MDB is under way. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1

"Defense chief Mattis in Asia, will discuss North Korea crisis with allies","CLARK FREEPORT ZONE, Philippines (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he would talk with Asian allies about North Korea and the crisis caused by Pyongyang s  reckless  provocations, as he kicked off a week-long trip to the region on Monday to meet defense chiefs in the Philippines.     Mattis  trip to Asia, which will also include stops in Thailand and South Korea, comes just weeks before President Donald Trump s first visit to Asia.     Trump has been locked in a war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, calling him a  rocket man  on a suicide mission for openly pursuing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States.     Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and its allies. Kim has blasted Trump as  mentally deranged.      Mattis, who has emphasized diplomacy, was expected to meet both his Japanese and South Korean counterparts on Monday before meeting with all three of them together. He will attend a meeting from Monday to Wednesday of defense ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as ASEAN, in the Philippines. He will go to Seoul later in the week for more defense talks.     I will talk with my counterparts, discussing the regional security crisis caused by the reckless DPRK North Korea provocations but also discuss our respect for shared values like sovereignty of the states, their territorial integrity, freedom of navigation through historically international waters, and fair and reciprocal trade,  Mattis told reporters. A U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea last week, seeking to promote freedom of navigation. The maneuver prompted anger in Beijing. Trump s trip next month will include a visit to China, which he has been pressuring to do more to rein in North Korea s missile and nuclear programs. China is North Korea s neighbor and biggest trading partner.     Mattis, while in the Philippines, said he would commend the military for defeating insurgents in Marawi City on the island of Mindanao.     Some experts see the siege as a prelude to a more ambitious bid by Islamic State loyalists to exploit Mindanao s poverty and use its jungles and mountains as a base to train, recruit and launch attacks in the region.      It was a tough fight,  Mattis said, adding he thought the Philippines had sent  a very necessary message to the terrorists.      On Thursday, Mattis will lead the U.S. delegation in Thailand for the cremation rites for the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1
Australia to spend up to $195 million housing refugees after PNG detention center closes,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will spend up to A$250 million ($195 million) housing nearly 800 refugees and asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea for the next 12 months after its controversial detention center closes this month. But hundreds of detainees are refusing the leave the Australian-run and funded Manus Island detention center, which will close on Oct. 31, fearing for their safety in the general community on Manus Island off Papua New Guinea s north coast. Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish-Iranian journalist held on Manus Island for four years, said detainees fear being assaulted if they moved to the new, Australian-funded Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre.  Refugees either move to Lorengau where they risk being attacked by angry local people, or be taken over by PNG defense forces who have already seriously threatened their safety,  Boochani told Reuters. Australia refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, instead detaining them in offshore centers on Manus and the South Pacific island nation of Nauru. The United Nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centers.The Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that the Manus center was illegal and the government in the capital Port Moresby ordered its closure. Australia had hoped the detainees would be either resettled into Papua New Guinea society or the United States, under a controversial refugee swap, by the time the center closed. So far, only 54 refugees have moved to the United States. Deputy commissioner of Australian Border Force Mandy Newton said on Monday that Australia would fund the operation of three new transit centers on Manus for detainees.  Refugees will be provided funding to purchase their own food and other personal items, security will be provided at three facilities and health care will be provided at the East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre,  Newton told a Senate hearing in Canberra.  I estimate it will cost between A$150-A$250 million.   The United Nations last week warned of a  humanitarian crisis  amid fears Australia would walk away completely from any involvement with refugees on the tiny Pacific Island. Refugee advocates said the new funding will not end a stand-off between asylum seekers and Australia, which they fear threatens to escalate into violence.

Suicide bomber kills 13 others in northeast Nigerian city: police official,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed 13 other people in the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri on Sunday, a police official said, the deadliest attack in over a month as the conflict with Boko Haram stretches into its ninth year. The evening attack, which also injured five people, struck the city s Muna Garage area, Damian Chukwu, a police commissioner, told Reuters. The area is home to a camp for just some of the more than 2 million people who have fled fighting with the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency, which has left over 20,000 dead. That conflict, the epicenter of which is in northeastern Nigeria, is showing little sign of slowing, despite assurances by the government and military that Boko Haram is on the verge of defeat. On Friday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned that  attacks against civilians - including suicide bombings in and near IDP (internally displaced person) camps - continue to be a major concern.  Two suicide bombers also injured 13 other people in a separate attack, said Chukwu. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"'Despondent' May losing sleep on in-fighting, said Juncker: FAZ","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Theresa May looked  despondent , with deep rings under her eyes, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker told aides after dining with the British prime minister last week, a German newspaper said on Sunday. The report by a Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung correspondent whose leaked account of a Juncker-May dinner in April caused upset in London, said Juncker thought her  marked  by battles over Brexit with her own Conservative ministers as she asked for EU help to create more room for maneuver at home. No immediate comment was available from Juncker s office, which has a policy of not commenting on reports of meetings. The FAZ said May, who flew in for a hastily announced dinner in Brussels with the European Commission president last Monday ahead of an EU summit, seemed to Juncker  anxious, despondent and disheartened ,  a woman who trusts hardly anyone but is also not ready for a clear-out to free herself . As she later did over dinner on Thursday with fellow EU leaders, May asked for help to overcome British divisions.  She indicated that back home friend and foe are at her back plotting to bring her down,  the paper said.  May said she had no room left to maneuver. The Europeans have to create it for her.   May s face and appearance spoke volumes, Juncker later told his colleagues,  the FAZ added.  She has deep rings under her eyes. She looks like someone who can t sleep a wink.  She smiles for the cameras, it went on,  but it looks forced , unlike in the past, when she could shake with laughter.  Now she needs all her strength not to lose her poise.  As with the April dinner at 10 Downing Street, when the FAZ reported that Juncker thought May  in another galaxy  in terms of Brexit expectations, both sides issued statements after last week s meeting saying talks were  constructive and friendly . They said they agreed negotiations should be  accelerated . May dismissed the dinner leak six months ago as  Brussels gossip , though officials on both sides said the report in the FAZ did little to foster an atmosphere of trust which they agree will be important to reach a deal. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was also reported to have been irritated by that leak. Although the summit on Thursday and Friday rejected May s call for an immediate start to talks on the future relationship, leaders made a gesture to speed up the process and voiced hopes of opening a new phase in December. Some said they understood May s difficulties in forging consensus in London. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Abe to push reform of Japan's pacifist constitution after election win,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling bloc scored a big win in Sunday s election, bolstering his chance of becoming the nation s longest-serving premier and re-energizing his push to revise the pacifist constitution. Abe s Liberal Democratic Party-led (LDP) coalition won a combined 312 seats, keeping its two-thirds  super majority  in the 465-member lower house, local media said. A hefty win raises the likelihood that Abe, who took office in December 2012, will secure a third three-year term as LDP leader next September and go on to become Japan s longest-serving premier. It also means his  Abenomics  growth strategy centered on the hyper-easy monetary policy will likely continue. Final official results from the election, which coincided with an approaching typhoon, are expected early on Monday. The U.S.-drafted constitution s Article 9, if taken literally, bans the maintenance of armed forces. But Japanese governments have interpreted it to allow a military exclusively for self-defense. Backers of Abe s proposal to clarify the military s ambiguous status say it would codify the status quo. Critics fear it would allow an expanded role overseas for the military. Abe said he would not stick to a target he had floated of making the changes by 2020.  First, I want to deepen debate and have as many people as possible agree,  he told a TV broadcaster.  We should put priority on that.  The LDP s junior partner, the Komeito, is cautious about changing the constitution, drawn up after Japan s defeat in World War Two. Several opposition parties favor changes, but do not necessarily agree on details. Amendments must be approved by two-thirds of each chamber of parliament and then by a majority in a public referendum.  Now that pro-constitutional change parties occupy more than two-thirds of the parliament, the constitution will be the most important political issue next year,  said Hidenori Suezawa, a financial market and fiscal analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.   And as we saw in the U.K. ... a referendum could be tricky. So while Abe is likely to be prime minister for the time being, it is too early to say whether he can stay in power until 2021.  Abe declined to say if he would run for a third term. Abe had said he needed a new mandate to tackle a ""national crisis"" from North Korea's missile and nuclear threats and a fast-aging population, and to approve his idea of diverting revenue from a planned sales tax hike to education and child care from public debt repayment [reut.rs/2yC0pma]. He called the poll amid confusion in the opposition camp and an uptick in his ratings, dented earlier in the year by scandals over suspected cronyism and a perception he had grown arrogant after nearly five years in office. Abe has backed U.S. President Donald Trump s tough stance towards North Korea, which has test-fired missiles over Japan,  that all options, including military action, are on the table. Trump is to visit Japan Nov. 5-7 to reaffirm the leaders  tight ties. Abe s snap poll gamble had seemed risky - some early forecasts saw the LDP losing a significant chunk of seats - after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, often floated as possibly Japan s first female premier, launched her conservative Party of Hope.  That party absorbed a big chunk of the failed main opposition Democratic Party, which abruptly decided to run no candidates of its own. But voter enthusiasm soon waned despite its calls for popular policies such as an exit from nuclear power and a freeze on the planned sales tax rise. Koike did not run for a lower house seat herself - she was  in Paris for a climate change event on Sunday - and failed to say whom her party would back for prime minister.  We had sought to put policies first. But we ended up with a very tough outcome, so I deeply apologize for that,  Koike told NHK. A new Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), formed by liberal former DP members, got 54 seats, beating the 49 seats of Koike s party to become the biggest opposition group, although both have just a fraction of the LDP s presence.  Day by day, we felt we were getting more voter support for our call to revive more decent politics, and not fret about whether it s right or left wing,  said CDPJ lawmaker Tetsuro Fukuyama. Several experts noted the ruling bloc s win was less a victory for the conservative, long-ruling LDP than a defeat for a divided opposition.  Simply put, this was the self-destruction of the opposition,  said Zentaro Kamei, a senior research fellow at think tank PHP Institute and former LDP lawmaker. Shinjiro Koizumi, the LDP lawmaker son of popular former Premier Junichiro Koizumi, warned against LDP complacency.  It s not just that our party has become arrogant and complacent. People are also getting increasingly fed up with us,  he told NHK. Abe, 63, has already led the LDP and its partner, the Komeito, to four landslide wins since he took the helm of the party. But turnout has been low and the LDP has typically won with about 25 percent of eligible votes. Others either stayed home or backed opposition parties.  Kyodo news agency estimated turnout on Sunday - when heavy rain from powerful Typhoon Lan lashed much of Japan - at 53.7 percent, 1 point above the record low in the last lower house election in 2014.

Spain urges Catalonia secessionists to obey Madrid,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - The Spanish government has urged Catalans to accept Madrid s decision to dismiss their secessionist leadership and to take control of the restive region, as the nation s biggest political crisis in decades enters a decisive week. Spain s foreign minister made the comment on Sunday, a day after Madrid vowed to take the unprecedented step of firing the Catalonia government, in a last resort to thwart the region s push for independence and to calm fears of unrest and economic turmoil in the heart of the euro zone. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont rejected Madrid s decision, to be implemented this week, and thousands of pro-independence protesters marched in Barcelona on Saturday. The regional parliament s speaker, Carme Forcadell, said she too would not accept Madrid s move and accused Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of staging a  coup . Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis responded on Sunday with the call to obey Madrid.  All the government is trying to do, and reluctantly, is to reinstate the legal order, to restore the constitution but also the Catalan rules and proceed from there,  Dastis told BBC TV.  We are going to establish the authorities who are going to rule the day-to-day affairs of Catalonia according to the Catalan laws and norms ... I hope everyone will disregard whatever instructions they will be planning to give because they will not have the legal authority to do that.  However, Dastis sought to calm nerves in the region, saying Madrid would not conduct arrests among the pro-independence leadership, though two prominent secessionists were detained on court order this month on allegations of sedition.  We are not going to arrest anyone,  he said. Catalonia s leaders say they will not accept direct rule imposed by Madrid, raising the prospect that they and their supporters will seek to defy the Spanish government when the time comes to remove them from office. Rajoy s use of special constitutional powers still needs Senate approval in a session set for Friday. Once it gains the expected approval, Madrid can take full control of Catalonia s finances, police and public media and curb the powers of the regional parliament for up to six months, until fresh regional elections. Street protests for and against independence in Catalonia have involved hundreds of thousands of people. Though a violent crackdown by national police during Catalonia s Oct. 1 independence vote left hundreds injured, according to regional authorities, the protests have remained peaceful so far.  But Rajoy s unprecedented plan to use special constitutional powers has angered both sides and raised concern over the potential for unrest if Catalan leaders resist and call for civil disobedience. They have not done that, but investors are worried about the possible fallout from such moves in a region that makes up a fifth of Spain s economy. Hundreds of companies have shifted their headquarters outside the region and Madrid has made downward revisions to its economic forecasts. Mikel Lekue, a 24-year-old Spaniard studying in Barcelona, said he did not support Catalan independence but criticized Rajoy s tactics in invoking article 155 of the national constitution for the first time to take control of a region.  I don t agree with article 155. For all the errors the Catalan government has made, and they have made many, I don t think the solution is to remove Catalan autonomy,  he said as he walked in central Barcelona with a friend.  I think they need to sit down and talk.  Rajoy, who acted with backing from King Felipe and the main opposition party in Madrid, said the crisis was jeopardizing political and economic stability in the euro zone s fourth-largest economy. Puigdemont, who made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10 after the referendum, called Rajoy s move the  worst attacks against the people of Catalonia  since Spain s military dictatorship. He stopped short of saying he would make good his threat to push ahead with a parliamentary vote on independence before direct rule takes effect. But he has called the Catalan parliament to meet next week to agree on a response to Madrid, something many observers said could pave the way for a formal declaration of independence. The regional assembly is expected to decide on Monday when it will hold a session. Several influential Catalan newspapers called on Puidgemont on Sunday to resolve the crisis by calling a snap election before direct rule becomes effective. However, an opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot, in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government. Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull, however, told Catalan radio this was not an option and instead suggested that the parliament could move forward with secession.  Catalonia will be what decides the parliament, which is the legitimate representative of the citizens, and not what others decide,  Turull said. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
U.S. senators seek answers on U.S. presence in Niger after ambush,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators said on Sunday the White House has not been forthcoming with details about the military s presence in Niger after the deaths of four soldiers there earlier this month and they want more answers on U.S. operations in the west African country. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said in separate interviews that they support Republican Senator John McCain s effort to get answers from the Pentagon on the ambush and more broadly on the U.S. fight against ISIS in Niger. Graham and Schumer said they had been unaware of the large U.S. presence in the country and said Congress needs more information on what could become a long and open-ended involvement.  I didn t know there was 1,000 troops in Niger,  Graham said on NBC s Meet the Press.  This is an endless war without boundaries and no limitation on time and geography,  he added.  You ve got to tell us more and he [McCain] is right to say that.  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told Graham and McCain, who serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Friday that the military is shifting its counter-terrorism strategy to focus more on Africa and expanding the ability to use force against suspected terrorists. The attack earlier this month, which U.S. officials suspect was carried out by a local Islamic State affiliate, has thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counter-terrorism mission in Niger, which has about 800 U.S. troops. U.S. President Donald Trump drew attention to the ambush after sparring last week with Democratic Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, who criticized the president for what she said were insensitive remarks to the widow of one of the fallen soldiers. Democrat Schumer said on the same program on Sunday that he, like Graham, had also been unaware of the large presence of U.S. troops in Niger and is also awaiting more answers from the military this week. He said Congress may need to re-examine the current authorization for what he said could be a long, open-ended involvement in the country and region.  We need to look at this carefully. This is a brave new world. There are no set battle plans,  he said, adding that Congress currently authorizes action as part of the authorization of military use that has been in place for 16 years since the September 11 terror attacks on the United States.  I would be for re-examining this. There is no easy answer but we need to look at it. The answer we have now is not adequate,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"Slovenian President Pahor fails to win majority, faces runoff","LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenian President Borut Pahor will face a second-round election on Nov. 12 after he fell short of a majority in Sunday s first round, as he tries to win a second five-year mandate. With 99 percent of the vote counted, according to the State Election Commission, Pahor had 47.1 percent of the vote. In next month s runoff, he will face Marjan Sarec, the mayor of the city of Kamnik, who took 25 percent. Turnout reached 43.5 percent. The result contradicted exit polls by TV Slovenia that showed Pahor winning in the first round.  In the second round anything is possible, although Pahor is a big favorite,  Peter Jancic, the editor of political website Spletni Casopis told Reuters. Although the office is mostly ceremonial, the president leads the army and also nominates several top officials, including the central bank governor. Most of his nominations have to be confirmed by parliament. The vote amounted to a warning for Prime Minister Miro Cerar and his Party of Modern Centre (SMC) before the general election due next June or July. Its candidate, Education Minister Maja Makovec Brencic, took only 1.7 percent of the vote and came seventh out of nine candidates.  SMC will surely have a lot to show at parliamentary election,  Cerar told TV Slovenia.  We have a lot of ideas for the future.  Pahor, 53, who ran as an independent candidate, is a former long-time leader of the center-left Social Democrats. He told reporters he will focus on  connecting people, cooperation, political stability and security  if he wins in the second round. He was Slovenia s prime minister from 2008 to 2012, the years that led to the worst financial crisis in Slovenia s history. In 2013, the country only narrowly avoided an international bailout for its banks.  A former fashion model, he is also known as the  king of the Instagram , for posting photos on Instagram showing him in his official duties but also in various sports activities. Sarec, 39, is not affiliated with parliamentary parties but is running as a candidate of his own non-parliamentary, center-left party, Lista Marjana Sarca. He is a former actor.  I am happy about this result, which shows that us mayors do a lot for people at the local level and are working hard,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"Putin critic Navalny, freed from jail, resumes presidential campaign","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny held a political rally on Sunday, hours after being released from jail and pledged to continue his presidential campaign despite the authorities saying he is ineligible to stand.  Navalny, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, was detained by police in late September and sentenced to 20 days in jail on charges of repeatedly violating laws by organizing public meeting and rallies. It was the third time he had been jailed this year, part of what he says is a pattern of Kremlin harassment designed to thwart his political ambitions. Russia s central election commission has declared him ineligible to run for president next year due to a suspended prison sentence, which he says was politically-motivated. Shrugging off that ban, the 41-year-old lawyer held a campaign rally in the provincial town of Astrakhan in southern Russia on Sunday evening, hours after walking free from jail.  He said after the rally he would continue to campaign and had the right to take part in next year s election.  We have more right to take part in the elections than all the other candidates combined,  Navalny wrote on his website.  Putin, 65, has for months declined to say whether he will run for what would be his fourth stint in the Kremlin, but is  widely expected to do so. Opinion polls suggest he would comfortably win.  One candidate who has declared her hand is TV personality Ksenia Sobchak who said last week she planned to run, offering liberal voters unhappy with Putin s rule someone to back, though she has little prospect of winning. Some opposition activists fret she is a Kremlin project designed to split the opposition, something she denies. Last month, commenting on rumors that Sobchak would run, Navalny complained she was being used by the Kremlin as a safe lightning conductor for voters  dissatisfaction. But he struck a more conciliatory note on Sunday with TV Rain citing him as saying that everyone, including Sobchak, had the right to take part in the March election.

Protesters call for justice after Maltese journalist's killing,"VALLETTA (Reuters) - Thousands of Maltese called for justice on Sunday in a protest held by a group of non-governmental organizations after a journalist was killed last Monday. The demonstrations in Malta s capital, Valletta, were organized by the group Civil Society Network after the car bombing  that killed anti-corruption blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia, 53, in a murder that shocked the Mediterranean island.  Some of those present at the protest carried placards or wore T-shirts with the last words written by Caruana Galizia, minutes before she was killed:  There are crooks everywhere you look now. The situation is desperate.   You remember, we gathered, almost three years ago, in Paris, after the Charlie Hebdo killing. We have gathered today in Valletta for Daphne and everybody can say  I am Daphne, je suis Daphne ,  Christophe Deloire, secretary-general of Reporters without Frontiers, told the crowd. Michael Briguglio, who heads the Civil Society Network, said the commissioner of police and the attorney general should be removed for not having acted following revelations in the so-called  Panama Papers .  Caruana Galizia reported in April that the wife of Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat was the beneficiary of a secret company in Panama, called Egrant, in which $1 million had been deposited from Azerbaijan. The claim was strenuously denied by the prime minister and by his wife.  A magisterial inquiry on the Egrant charges is still under way.  The Maltese government on Saturday announced a one million- euro reward and protection for anyone who comes forward with information leading to the identification of whoever was behind the journalist s murder.  This is a case of extraordinary importance which requires extraordinary measures,  the government said in a statement on the reward. Muscat, re-elected with a large majority for a second five-year term in June, did not attend the protest on Sunday, saying it would have been  inappropriate .  A delegation from his Labour Party and the Opposition Nationalist Party attended.   President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca attended, walking at the back of the large crowd with her husband. She was later due to meet a delegation of the Civil Society Network.  Flowers were laid at the foot of the Malta Great Siege monument   commemorating the unsuccessful siege of Malta by Ottoman Turks in 1565 -  which has become a temporary shrine for Caruana Galizia.  It is us who are now under siege,  a participant said as he looked at the banks of flowers under a picture of Caruana Galizia.  ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"Eleven killed in clashes in Ethiopia's Oromiya region, official says","ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethnic clashes killed 11 people this week in Ethiopia s Oromiya region, a regional government official said on Sunday, the latest unrest in a province that was wracked by violence in 2015 and 2016. Nearly 700 people died last year during one period of the violence in Ethiopia s largest region and other areas, according to a parliament-mandated investigation. The unrest forced the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was finally lifted in August. Sporadic protests have taken place since then. Violence broke out this week in two districts in the province s west after protests led to clashes between ethnic Oromos and Amharas, the spokesman for the region s administration said on Sunday.  Eight Oromos and three Amharas died,  spokesman Addisu Arega Kitessa said in a statement.  The previous unrest was provoked by a development scheme for the capital, Addis Ababa, that dissidents said amounted to land grabs. Broader anti-government demonstrations followed, over politics and human rights abuses.  The violence included attacks on businesses, many of them foreign-owned, including farms growing flowers for export.  Separately, clashes along the border between the country s Oromiya and Somali regions last month also displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The area has been plagued by sporadic violence for decades. A referendum held in 2004 to determine the status of disputed settlements failed to ease tensions. Those clashes have  fueled fears about security in Ethiopia, the region s biggest economy and a staunch Western ally. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Iraqi Kurdish opposition party Gorran calls on Barzani to step down,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Gorran, a main opposition party to Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, called on Sunday for his resignation, and for a  national salvation government  to be formed to deal with crisis pitting the Kurds and the central Iraqi authorities. Gorran, or the Change Movement, blamed Barzani for the  disaster  facing the Kurds after the loss on Oct. 16 of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, captured by Iraqi forces in retaliation to a Kurdish independence referendum held last month despite warnings from Baghdad and neighboring Iran and Turkey.  The Kurdistan presidency must be dissolved and a national salvation government be formed to overcome the current situation,  said a statement published by the party leadership after meeting in the Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya. Gorran supports the right of Iraq s Kurds for self-determination but it opposed holding the referendum on Sept. 25, saying the timing was ill-chosen. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"Militants attack Egypt police, dozens killed: sources","CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s security forces suffered one of their heaviest attacks after militants firing rockets and detonating explosives hit a police operation on Friday in the western desert, authorities and security sources said on Saturday. Three security sources said at least 52 police officers and conscripts had been killed in gun battles that erupted in the remote desert, but Egyptian authorities said only 16 men had died when their patrol came under attack.  Egyptian authorities on Saturday said two police operations were moving in on a suspected militant hideout on Friday when one of the patrols came under fire from heavy weapons in a remote area around 135 km southwest of Cairo. The interior ministry said 16 police were killed in that part of the operation, and 13 more were wounded. At least 15 militants were also killed in the gun fight. The statement did not give details on any casualties in the other police patrol.  As soon as the first mission approached the location of the terrorist elements, they sensed the arrival of the forces and targeted them using heavy weapons from all directions,  the interior ministry said in a statement. One security source said the convoy was attacked from higher ground by militants firing rocket-propelled grenades and detonating explosive devices on the ground. Security has been a key point for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former military commander who presents himself as a bulwark against terrorism after leading the ouster of president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. Sisi was elected on a landslide a year later. Though he has yet to declare his intentions, Sisi is widely expected to run for re-election in April next year with little opposition. But critics say his popularity has been dimmed because of security and economic austerity policies.   No group made any claim or statement about Friday s operation not far from the capital. But most of the fighting so far between militants and security forces has been in northern Sinai, where an Islamic State affiliate operates. Security sources earlier said the police had been hunting hideout of the Hasm Movement, an Islamist militant group blamed for attacks on judges and police around the capital. That group has in the past only carried out mostly small operations since it emerged last year. Egyptian authorities say it is the armed militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. Most of its leadership has been jailed in a crackdown under Sisi. Since Sisi came to power, hundreds of troops and police have been killed in often sophisticated attacks by militants in the northern Sinai region, where Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis group pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. Last Sunday, at least 24 militants and six soldiers were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai, when more than 100 militants repeatedly attacked security outposts south of the border town of Sheikh Zuweid. Attacks have mostly hit police and armed forces, but militants have also extended their campaign outside the Sinai, targeting Egypt s Christians with bomb attacks on churches in Cairo and other cities.

Mugabe removed as WHO goodwill envoy after outrage,"GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has been removed as a goodwill ambassador, the World Health Organization said on Sunday, following outrage among Western donors and rights groups at his appointment. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus named Mugabe to the largely ceremonial post at a meeting on Wednesday in Uruguay on chronic diseases attended by both men.  At the time, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as  a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide healthcare to all . But Tedros said in a statement that he had listened to those expressing concerns and heard the  different issues  raised.  Over the last few days, I have reflected on my appointment of H.E. President Robert Mugabe as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for NCDs (non-communicable diseases) in Africa. As a result I have decided to rescind the appointment,  Tedros said. The decision had been taken after consultation with the Harare government and was  in the best interests of the World Health Organization , he said. Jeremy Farrar, a global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity and the NCD alliance, representing health groups combating chronic diseases, welcomed the reversal.  Dr Tedros deserves all our support to ensure he and WHO build a global health movement that is inclusive and works to improve health for everyone,  Farrar said in a statement.  Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Walter Muzembi accepted the move while insisting that WHO had  benefited tremendously  from having nominated Mugabe and the media buzz it brought to health issues.  So on the balance, it is wiser to let go, and help WHO focus on its mandate while we focus Zimbabwe on its membership obligations,  Muzembi said in a government statement. Several former and current WHO staff had said privately they were appalled at the  poor judgment  and  miscalculation  by Tedros, elected the first African head of WHO in May. Mugabe was head of the African Union when the bloc endorsed Tedros - a former health and foreign minister of Ethiopia - over other African candidates for the top post, without any real regional contest, they said.  Mugabe, 93, is blamed in the West for destroying Zimbabwe s economy and for numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister. Britain had said Mugabe s appointment as a goodwill ambassador was  surprising and disappointing  and that it risked overshadowing the WHO s global work. The United States, which has imposed sanctions on Mugabe for alleged human rights violations, also voiced disappointment.  He (Tedros) has to remember where his funding comes from,  said one health official who declined to be identified. The Trump administration, which is already questioning financial support for some United Nations agencies, is WHO s largest single donor. WHO is struggling to recover a reputation tarnished by its slowness in tackling the Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa from 2014-2015 under Tedros  predecessor, Margaret Chan. The agency is now grappling with a massive cholera outbreak in Yemen that has infected some 800,000 people in the past year and a plague outbreak in Madagascar that has killed nearly 100 in two months.

Czech tycoon Babis to be named prime minister but may struggle to find partners,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech President Milos Zeman said on Sunday he would name Andrej Babis prime minister, but the tycoon leader of the anti-establishment ANO party may struggle to find coalition partners despite his emphatic election win. ANO won 29.6 percent of the vote at the weekend s polls, nearly three times as much as its closest rival, but many parties expressed reluctance or rejected outright any coalition with it while Babis fights off fraud charges. Zeman said the charges were not an obstacle for Babis - the second richest Czech who has been compared to other tycoons-turned-political leaders Donald Trump and Silvio Berlusconi - to become prime minister.  My aim is that when I appoint the prime minister, and that will be Andrej Babis, that there is certainty or at least high probability that this prime minister will be successful in a parliamentary vote of confidence,  Zeman said in a live interview on news website www.blesk.cz. ANO will control 78 seats in the 200-seat lower house so still needs partners from the other eight factions to form a majority, but Babis s stance as an anti-establishment force has made it difficult to forge alliances. Opponents see Babis, worth an estimated $4 billion, as a danger to democracy because of his commanding leadership style and business and media power that they fear could pose conflicts of interest. Police allege Babis hid ownership of one of his firms a decade ago to receive a 2 million euro EU subsidy that was meant for small businesses. He denies wrongdoing.  He moved his chemicals, food and media firms to a trust earlier this year when he held the job of finance minister, to meet conflict of interest legislation. The center-right Civic Democrats, who came second in the election with 25 seats, said they would remain in opposition.  I have already ruled out talks with ANO on taking part in a government or supporting a government,  party chief Petr Fiala said on Seznam.cz news website. Two small center-right parties, STAN and TOP09, also said they would not work with Babis.   I can t legitimize him and create the appearance of normality,  said Jan Farsky, election leader for STAN.  Democratic forces got trounced but they will not regain strength by cooperation with Babis. That would finish them off,  he told Reuters. The center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who won just 7.3 percent of the vote, said they may enter talks with ANO, their current coalition partner, but only if Babis personally stays out of the cabinet. The centrist Christian Democrats, the third current coalition partner, also made any potential support conditional on Babis not being in the government. The liberal Pirate Party,  which came third in the election, also said Babis s charges were obstacle to any cooperation. Babis has promised to stay out of the euro zone and pressure the European Union to counter immigration, but also to keep the country firmly in the EU and NATO. But a refusal by mainstream parties to work with ANO could lead Babis to turn to the Communists and the anti-EU, anti-immigration Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD) for political support.  SPD chief Tomio Okamura said Babis should stay out of the cabinet if he were to consider support. His conditions for talks would be a tough stance against immigration, a ban on promoting Islam and a referendum on leaving the European Union, he said. The make-up of the cabinet will influence the country s tone in the EU, but unlike Poland s leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski or Hungary s Viktor Orban, Babis does not share the anti-liberal stance that has driven Warsaw and Budapest into deep spats with western partners. President Zeman said he would meet Babis on Monday to discuss the next steps but suggested the formal appointment would happen later.  He said he would call the first session of the new parliament after the maximum 30 days allowed by the constitution, to provide time for coalition talks. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"Czech election websites hacked, vote unaffected -Statistics Office","PRAGUE (Reuters) - The websites used for presentation of the Czech Republic s election results were hacked on Saturday afternoon, the Czech Statistical Office (CSU) said on Sunday, adding that the vote count was not affected. Czechs voted on Friday and Saturday in the parliamentary election, with the results then shown on two websites that CSU maintains with an outside provider.  During the processing (of the vote), there was a targeted DDoS attack aimed at the infrastructure of the O2 company used for elections,  CSU said on its website.      As a result, servers volby.cz and volbyhned.cz had been temporarily partly inaccessible. The attack did not in any way affect either the infrastructure used for the transmission of election results to the CSU headquarters or the independent data processing.  The anti-establishment ANO party won 29.6 percent of the vote but may struggle to find coalition partners. Many parties expressed reluctance or rejected outright any coalition with the ANO while its billionaire founder and leader Andrej Babis fights off fraud charges. Czech President Milos Zeman said on Sunday that he would name Andrej Babis prime minister.  In the last similar case, in January, the Czech Foreign Ministry said that hackers had breached dozens of its email accounts in an attack resembling one against the U.S. Democratic Party that the former Obama administration blamed on Russia. On the European Union level, the threat of cyber attacks has been taken more seriously in recent months after hacking attempts detected by some of the 28 member states. EU defense ministers tested their ability to respond to a potential hacking attack in their first cyber war games in September. The exercise was based on a simulated attack on one of the bloc s military missions abroad. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Japan's Abe says won't delay tax hike unless big shock hits economy,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Sunday the government will proceed with a scheduled sales tax increase in 2019 unless the economy suffers a shock as big as the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. He also defended the government s plan to divert some of the proceeds from the scheduled tax hike to 10 percent from 8 percent to child care and education, saying that investing in children will  undoubtedly lead to stronger economic growth .  Our administration has worked on fiscal reform more than any other administration,  Abe told a television program as his ruling bloc headed for a big win in Sunday s general election.  In order to pay back Japan s public debt, you need economic growth,  he said.  We d like to proceed with fiscal reform by spurring economic growth and investment,  Abe said, suggesting his administration will continue to focus on reflating growth rather than fiscal austerity. Abe s ruling bloc was set for a big win in Sunday s election, bolstering his chances of becoming the nation s longest-serving premier. Abe twice delayed the sales tax hike to 10 percent after an earlier increase to 8 percent tipped Japan into recession. Analysts say increasing the levy is crucial to rein in Japan s huge public debt which, at twice the size of its economy, is the biggest among major industrialized nations.

Fierce firefight as Philippines' toughest urban war down to last building,"MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Philippine troops were locked in an intense urban firefight on Sunday with the last remnants of a pro-Islamic state alliance, as the army sought to declare an end to the country s biggest internal security crisis in years. An estimated 30 people, including militants and some of their family members, were battling to hold a fortified, two-storey building next to Marawi City s vast Lake Lanao, and appeared ready to fight to the death, according to the deputy commander of the operation.  There s just one building and they re inside,  Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference.  We believe these are ones who decided to fight it out, because they believe that if they die there they will go to Heaven.  Brawner said soldiers were using loudspeakers to urge them to surrender, and anticipated the gunfight could go on until midnight. They did not know how many people in the building were alive or dead, he said. The siege of Marawi has stunned the Philippines and stoked wider concerns that Islamic State loyalists have learned how to thrive in impoverished Muslim areas of the island of Mindanao and use its jungles and mountains as staging posts to launch attacks. Those fears are compounded by the Marawi rebels  ability to recruit young fighters, stockpile huge amounts of arms and endure five months of ground offensive and government air strikes that have devastated the city. The military made a significant gain with last week s killing of Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State s  emir  in Southeast Asia and Omarkhayam Maute, a leader of the Maute militant group. Another leader and possible bankroller of the operation, Malaysian Mahmud Ahmad, was likely killed also, the military said. Brawner said the authorities believed foreign operatives were among those still fighting and it was clear there was now a leadership vacuum.  At this point we don t know who is really the leader,  he added.  Our government forces will try to do everything to finish the firefight today.  Troops have started a phased withdrawal and the authorities may soon allow some residents to return to homes not damaged by the fighting, which displaced at least 300,000 people. More than 1,000 have been killed, mostly militants. The government estimates the rebuilding of Marawi could cost at least 50 billion pesos ($971 million). ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"Hamas deputy leader says to continue Iran ties, armed fight","DUBAI (Reuters) - The deputy head of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas vowed to keep close ties with Israel s arch-enemy Iran and to maintain its weapons, Iranian media reported on Sunday, rejecting Israeli preconditions for any peace talks. Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist group by Western countries and Israel, signed a reconciliation deal this month with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas s Fatah faction.      Undoubtedly, the Palestinian resistance forces will never give up ... their arms,  the semi-official news agency Mehr quoted Saleh Arouri as saying at a meeting with the Iranian parliament s speaker Ali Larijani in Tehran.  Israel said on Tuesday it would not hold peace negotiations with a Palestinian government dependent on Hamas and demanded that Hamas recognize Israel, disarm, and sever its ties with Iran.  Our presence in Iran is the practical denial of the third pre-condition   cutting ties with Iran,  Arouri said earlier, quoted by Iran s Fars news agency. In August, a Hamas leader said that Iran was again its biggest provider of money and arms after years of tension over the civil war in Syria. Hamas had angered Tehran by refusing to support its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in the six-year-old civil war. Hamas seeks Israel s destruction. It has fought three wars with Israel since seizing the Gaza Strip from forces loyal to Western-backed President Abbas in 2007. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"Typhoon kills at least two in Japan, prompts call for thousands to evacuate","TOKYO (Reuters) - A typhoon roared towards Japan s main island on election day on Sunday, killing at least two people, prompting a warning for tens of thousands to evacuate and the cancellation of hundreds of flights. One man was killed under scaffolding that collapsed in high winds and a fisherman was killed as he tended to his boat, Kyodo news agency said. There were a handful of minor injuries.  Typhoon Lan, classified as an intense Category 4 storm by the Tropical Storm Risk monitoring site, was south of Japan and moving northeast at 50 kph on Sunday night, speeding up slightly, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. Lan appeared to have weakened slightly from its peak, but it was still a powerful storm that could pound parts of Japan with more than 80 mm (3 inches) of rain an hour, an agency official told reporters.  It is set to make landfall on Japan s main island of Honshu, possibly near Tokyo, early on Monday, at which time it is likely to have weakened to a Category 2 storm.  The wind and rain will grow stronger as the night goes on, so take measures as needed as early as possible, preferably before it gets dark,  the official said. The agency issued warnings for heavy rain and flooding on the Pacific side of Japan including the Tokyo metropolitan area, even though the typhoon is likely to be downgraded.  More than 70,000 households in various parts of Japan were advised to evacuate, with more than 5,000 ordered to do so, NHK public television said.  I live alone and at night it s scary, so I came here as early as I could,  one elderly woman told NHK at a evacuation center in western Japan. Wind gusts of up to 180 kph (111 mph) were possible across central and eastern Japan early on Monday, the JMA said, possibly hampering the morning rush hour even after the rain is expected to have largely dissipated. Several small landslides had occurred and rivers were rising close to the top of their banks. One part received more than 600 mm (23 inches) of rain in 48 hours, twice the usual amount of rain for the whole month of October. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters he had called on the government to take steps to minimize any threats to life.  More than 300 flights were canceled and rail services were interrupted across the country, in one case due to a power outage.  Toyota Motor Corp said it was cancelling the first shift at all of its assembly plants and that it would decide on a later shift around Monday noon. Abe s ruling bloc was headed for a big win in the election, exit polls showed, potentially reenergizing a push towards his cherished goal of revising the post-war, pacifist constitution. It was not immediately clear how the storm and warnings to evacuate affected voting. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"For some Chinese dissidents, party congress means a paid 'vacation'","BEIJING (Reuters) - Hu Jia, a well-known Chinese dissident who lives in Beijing, says he had hoped to go to the southeastern city of Xiamen for his government-sponsored holiday, but state security officials said no.   They told me I had to go to a more isolated place this time,  he told Reuters by phone from Yunnan province in far southwestern China, a popular destination renowned for its scenery and the culture of its ethnic minority groups. Rights groups say that Hu is one dozens of activists and dissidents detained, placed under tighter monitoring or  vacationed  by authorities,  during the week-long congress of the ruling Communist Party which began on Wednesday in Beijing. President Xi Jinping is expected to tighten his grip on power at the gathering, which is only held once every five years. For his enforced holiday, Hu and his two government minders jointly decided on the destinations. Hu suggested the ancient town of Dali in Yunnan for the first stop, and the public security agents accompanying him chose the second and third stops in the southwest region, Guiyang   the capital of the mountainous province of Guizhou, and the coastal city of Beihai in Guangxi province.  Hu estimated the whole trip for the three of them will cost close to 10,000 yuan ($1,510), all paid for by the authorities. He said that his minders tried to save money by choosing basic hotels and traveling between the three cities by bus. He will fly back to Beijing on Oct 28, just after the congress ends.  You can go see the sights, but state security goes with you everywhere,  Hu said. Reuters was unable to independently verify the accounts of Hu and other dissidents interviewed for this story. China s public security ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment on the detention of activists, and the use of  vacations.  China rarely explains its treatment of dissidents other than to say that those charged are criminals who harmed social stability and that all people in China are treated equally before the law. It is not unusual for Chinese authorities to heighten monitoring and detention of dissidents before important political events, especially people with high profiles who are  known to speak out against the party and state. In addition to the enforced vacations, some activists have also been detained, placed under supervision at home, or warned about posting critical messages online in the weeks ahead of congress, according to the Hong Kong-based group Chinese Human Rights Defenders.  The group also said it had documented 14 cases of detention of activists in recent weeks. In one case, Wu Kemu, a truck driver from Xuancheng city in the central province of Anhui, was called in by the police for a talk on October 11 and has not been released since, his wife Fang Liangxiang told Reuters by phone on Sunday.  They will not say when he will be released. They just told me to wait at home for him,  she said, adding that she expected the detention was related to critical things Wu had said about the government on the popular instant messaging platform WeChat. No one answered the phone on Saturday at the Xuancheng city detention center where Fang says Wu is being held. It is unclear if the total number of detentions, arrests or  vacations  this year is greater than at the time of previous major events or how many of the cases are directly related to the congress. Some activists say that the authorities prefer enforced vacations rather than detentions as they can make dissidents both inactive and inaccessible to foreign journalists over sensitive periods. Locking people up can attract more attention. Hu, a pro-democracy activist and campaigner for those with HIV/AIDS, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for subversion in 2008, and said he has been under regular state surveillance since his release.  The first thing I did was go for a run up in the mountains by Dali, because I knew the state security agents could not run with me,  he said, adding that the agents were  not the running type.   It felt like being briefly free from prison,  he said. Hu said that state security agents had shown him a list of people who would not be allowed to stay in Beijing over the 19th Party Congress, including Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.   Liu Xia has been under effective house arrest in Beijing since her husband won the Nobel Prize in 2010. After his death in July, even the sporadic communications she s had with friends have been nearly entirely severed, two of them told Reuters. The public security ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Liu Xia s situation. Some activists make their own travel plans to avoid the authorities. Wu Lihong, an activist from Wuxi city in Jiangsu province who for over a decade has been protesting pollution in Lake Tai in eastern China, told Reuters that Chinese state security had called him last week saying they were coming to take him for a forced vacation. Wu, though, had already gone to visit a friend in Zhejiang province, on the east coast and far away from Beijing, to avoid them.  At the 16th, 17th and 18th Congresses I was vacationed, imprisoned, held at home and forbidden to speak,  Wu said.   This time, I chose to go on holiday without them,  he said. He said that state security officials had asked him to return to Wuxi so they could take him on  vacation  themselves, but he declined saying he would stay with his friend till after the congress ends. He is now avoiding their calls. Reuters could not independently confirm Wu s comments. Chinese state security does not have a public phone number, fax number or website.     Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on rights lawyers and activists since coming to power in 2012, jailing dozens, in what rights groups say is a coordinated attempt to quash dissent in China. New internet measures include rules that hold users accountable for critical posts even in private group chats and a renewed crackdown on technologies to circumvent restrictions.  Kit Chan, director of the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group, said that some recent detentions of activists represent a new direction in the crackdown as it shows the authorities are targeting smaller groups that draw attention to specific rights issues as much as their traditional focus on pro-democracy activists. Zhen Jianghua, for example, the founder of Human Rights Campaign in China, a grassroots organization based in the southern province of Guangzhou, was detained on Sept 1 in Zhuhai, a source close to Zhen who declined to be named told Reuters. The ministry of public security did not respond to a faxed request for comment about the targeting of grassroots organizations. A person who answered the phone at the Zhuhai public security bureau said she was not aware of Zhen s case. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Indonesia demands answers after military chief denied U.S. entry,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia intends to send a diplomatic note to the U.S. secretary of state and summon Washington s deputy ambassador in Jakarta to explain why the head of its military was denied entry to the United States, Indonesian officials said on Sunday. Armed Forces Commander General Gatot Nurmantyo was about to board a flight on Saturday when the airline informed him that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection had denied him entry, military spokesman Wuryanto told a news conference in Jakarta. Nurmantyo was going to the United States at the invitation of General Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, to attend a Chiefs of Defense Conference on Countering Violent Extremism being held in Washington on Oct. 23-24, Wuryanto said. It was not clear why he was stopped from entering the United States, Wuryanto said, adding that the general did not have any problem during his visit to the United States in February 2016.  We ve asked for clarification to the U.S., to the Department of State as well as the embassy in Jakarta and until now we re still waiting for that clarification,  Indonesia s Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi told Reuters. The ministry s spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir earlier said Indonesia s embassy in Washington was to send a diplomatic note to the U.S. secretary of state demanding explanation for the incident.The ministry will also summon the U.S. deputy ambassador in Jakarta on Monday to seek explanation, Nasir said, adding that the ambassador is presently not in Indonesia. The U.S. embassy in Jakarta said in a statement it was in touch with Nurmantyo s staff to facilitate his travel, but did not explain further.  U.S. Ambassador Joseph Donovan has apologized to Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi for any inconvenience to General Gatot,  the embassy wrote.  We remain committed to our Strategic Partnership with Indonesia as a way to deliver security and prosperity to both our nations and peoples.  Nurmantyo has frequently courted controversy in Indonesia because of his actions and what analysts perceive as his political ambitions. The general promotes the notion that Indonesia is besieged by  proxy wars  involving foreign states and even a renewed communist threat. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said this month that the armed forces should stay out of politics and ensure their loyalty is only to the state and the government. Indonesia, the world s biggest Muslim-majority country, generally enjoys good ties with the United States although in the past ties between the two countries  armed forces have been strained by alleged rights abuses involving Indonesia s military.

Factbox: How will Spain's central government take control of Catalonia?,"MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government will dismiss Catalonia s secessionist leadership and force the region into a new election, it decided on Saturday, unprecedented steps it said were needed to prevent the region breaking away. Below are details of the powers the Spanish government plans to assume for a maximum six months before regional elections are held as set out in a proposal to the upper house Senate.  The measures were formulated under a constitutional provision never before invoked in Spain s 40 years of democracy. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is asking for authorization to sack the regional government including president Carles Puigdemont and his deputy Oriol Junqueras, high-profile figures in the independence drive who organized a popular vote on secession on Oct. 1 in defiance of Madrid.  Central government ministries will take over the regional administration until calling fresh elections within six months of direct rule coming into force. On Saturday, Rajoy said he wanted to convene a vote  as soon as we get back to institutional normality . The Catalan parliament will retain a representative role, but the government will operate under the supervision of bodies chosen or created for the purpose by Madrid. The new administrators will take control of the Mossos d Esquadra regional police force, which has become embroiled in the controversy over the independence bid after allegedly failing to act to stop the referendum or protect national police who were drafted in to provide extra security. The Mossos, whose chief is under investigation on suspicion of sedition, will have to act on direct orders from their new bosses. If deemed necessary, Mossos officers may be replaced by national police. The Economy Ministry has already increased its control over regional finances, to block the use of state funds to organize the secession bid, and started paying directly for essential services. Under the new proposal, Madrid keeps financial control. Widely-watched Catalan public television TV3 will come under central control. Madrid s proposal to the Senate says this will ensure the information transmitted is  true, objective and balanced, in line with political, social and cultural pluralism, and territorial balance . The Senate, where Rajoy s People s Party has a majority, will vote on the proposal on Oct. 27. The opposition Socialist and Ciudadanos parties are backing Rajoy. After the measures are approved, they can be activated immediately or put on hold to be implemented in the future. Puigdemont could call an election himself before the government s plan comes into action, in which case direct rule would likely not be implemented. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
Catalonia's leaders fight off direct rule from Madrid,"MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia s leaders said on Saturday they would not accept direct rule imposed on the region by the Spanish government, as a political crisis that has rattled the economy and raised fears of prolonged unrest showed no signs of easing. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced earlier on Saturday he would invoke special constitutional powers to fire the regional government and force a new election to counter the region s move towards independence. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, who made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10 after a referendum to secede, called Rajoy s moves the  worst attacks against the people of Catalonia  since Spain s military dictatorship. It is the first time since Spain s return to democracy that the central government has used its powers to seize control of a regional administration.  Rajoy said it was necessary to end a crisis that has fractured the country and prompted Spain to reduce growth forecasts for the euro zone s fourth-largest economy. After taking party in peaceful demonstration, Puigdemont expressed his rejection of Madrid s move, but stopped short of saying he would make good his threat to push ahead with the independence bid before direct rule takes effect.  I ask the (Catalan) parliament to meet in a plenary session during which we, the representatives of the citizens  sovereignty, will be able to decide over this attempt to liquidate our government and our democracy, and act in consequence,  Puigdemont said in a televised address. Rajoy, who acted with backing from the main opposition party in Madrid and King Felipe, needs the authorization of Spain s upper house of parliament to impose direct rule.  Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,  he said. The Senate vote that would give Madrid full control of Catalonia s finances, police and public media and curb the powers of the regional parliament for up to six months is scheduled for next Friday. That could give the independence movement room to maneuver. The regional parliament s speaker, Carme Forcadell, said she would not accept Madrid s move and accused Rajoy of a  coup.   Prime Minister Rajoy wants the parliament of Catalonia to stop being a democratic parliament, and we will not allow this to happen,  Forcadell said in a televised speech. The assembly is expected to decide on Monday whether to hold a session to formally proclaim the republic of Catalonia. Catalan media have said Puigdemont could dissolve the regional parliament and call elections by next Friday. Under Catalan law, those elections would take place within two months. That would enable Puigdemont to go the polls earlier than envisaged by Rajoy, who spoke of a six-month timetable, and to exploit the anti-Madrid sentiment running high in the region.     Pro-independence groups have previously mustered more than 1 million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid s refusal to negotiate a solution. Puigdemont and his cabinet colleagues joined a demonstration in Barcelona, wearing yellow ribbons in support of two senior independence campaigners who have been jailed on charges of sedition.  Freedom! Freedom!  tens of thousands of protesters chanted as they waived independence flags and signs reading  Defending our land is not a crime,  and  Let s proclaim the republic.   (Rajoy) triggering this article will not resolve anything,  said 38-year-old builder Abel Fernandez, attending the demonstration with a pro-independence flag tied around his neck.  They won t be able to keep quiet the half of Catalonia that is in favor of independence and those who favor the right to decide.      Catalan authorities said about 90 percent of those who took part in the referendum on Oct. 1 voted for independence. But only 43 percent of the electorate participated, with most opponents of secession staying at home. The independence push has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain and divided Catalonia itself. It has also prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters out of the region. Rajoy on Saturday urged them to stay. His center-right People s Party (PP) government has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence. It received unequivocal backing from the opposition Socialist Party.  Differences with the PP on our territorial unity? None!  said Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez. Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the referendum were condemned by human rights groups, and secessionists accused Madrid of taking  political prisoners . ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
Austria's likely next chancellor hopes to form govt. in 60 days: paper,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Austria s likely next chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, wants talks over a new government to last no more than two months, he said in a newspaper interview published in Sunday.  Austria s president on Friday gave the green light to conservative leader Kurz, whose People s Party (OVP) secured 31.5 percent of the vote in last week s parliamentary election, to form a government.  The Austrians expect that there is quickly a strong and stable government which takes up work,  Kurz was quoted as saying by Austria s Kronen Zeitung.  That means that negotiations should be concluded in less than 60 days.  Kurz campaigned on a platform that combined a hard line on immigration similar to that of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) with traditional conservative principles like slimming down the state and cutting taxes. To form his coalition, only two of Austria s parliamentary parties, the Social Democrats (SPO) and FPO, have enough seats to give Kurz a majority if they go into coalition with the OVP. Kurz is currently holding an initial round of discussions with the leaders of all parties in parliament, the last of which is his meeting with outgoing Chancellor Christian Kern, the head of the Social Democrats, later on Sunday.  In a separate interview with tabloid Oesterreich, Kurz said his party has common ground with the FPO and that he had already held constructive talks with FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache.  In the conversation with Heinz-Christian Strache, I also had the impression that he has a strong willingness to effect change and creative drive,  Kurz was quoted as saying by OE24.

U.S.-backed militias seize key oil field in east Syria: SDF,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they captured Syria s largest oil field on Sunday, pressing their assault against Islamic State in the east of the country. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they took al-Omar field on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river in the early hours.  Our forces managed to liberate the fields without notable damages,  said Lilwa al-Abdallah, spokeswoman for the offensive in Deir al-Zor province.  The jihadists holed up in buildings in a nearby district, where the SDF was trying to hunt them down, she said.  With U.S.-led jets and special forces, the SDF has been battling in Deir al-Zor bordering Iraq. The alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias has focused on territory east of the river, which bisects the oil-rich province.  The Syrian army, with Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, has been waging its own separate offensive against Islamic State, mostly to the west of the river.  The U.S.-led coalition and the Russian military have been holding deconfliction meetings - to prevent clashes between planes and troops - though the two offensives have sometimes come into conflict. Islamic State has lost vast territory across Syria, and has now come under attack in its last footholds in a strip of the Euphrates valley and the desert in Deir al-Zor. The SDF declared victory over the jihadists in their former headquarters in Raqqa city this week. SDF fighters would now move to the frontlines in Deir al-Zor, speeding up the battle in eastern Syria. Last month, the Kurdish-led militias captured a major natural gas field upstream of Sunday s advance. Al-Omar oil field lies some 10 km (6.21 miles) north of the town of al-Mayadin, which government troops and their allies took earlier this month. The town had turned into a major base for Islamic State militants after the U.S.-backed offensive drove them out of Raqqa. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Islamic State fighters who had withdrawn from the oil field mounted a counter-attack overnight against government forces. The militants made some gains around al-Mayadin, the Britain-based monitor said.  But a Syrian military source denied this, saying there was no significant attack and fighting raged on at the same pace.  Any attack by the Islamic State militants there was a  desperate attempt , the source said.  The Syrian Arab Army is attacking, hitting Daesh positions...and advancing,  the source said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Russia accuses U.S.-led coalition of 'barbaric' bombing of Syria's Raqqa,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia accused the U.S.-led coalition in Syria on Sunday of wiping the city of Raqqa  off the face of the earth  with carpet bombing in the same way the United States and Britain had bombed Germany s Dresden in 1945. The Russian Defence Ministry, which has itself repeatedly been forced to deny accusations from activists and Western politicians of bombing Syrian civilians, said it looked like the West was now rushing to provide financial aid to Raqqa to cover up evidence of its own crimes. Major-General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Defence Ministry, said in a statement that around 200,000 people had lived in Raqqa before the conflict in Syria, but that not more than 45,000 people remained. U.S.-backed militias in Syria declared victory over Islamic State in Raqqa, the group s capital, last week, raising flags over the last jihadist footholds after a four-month battle.  Raqqa has inherited the fate of Dresden in 1945, wiped off the face of the earth by Anglo-American bombardments,  said Konashenkov. Most of the German city was destroyed in Allied bombing raids just before the end of World War Two. Though he said Russia welcomed Western promises of financial aid to rebuild Raqqa, Konashenkov complained that numerous Russian requests for the West to give humanitarian aid to Syrian civilians in other parts of the country had been rejected in previous years.   What is behind the rush by Western capitals to provide targeted financial help only to Raqqa?,  said Konashenkov.  There s only one explanation - the desire to cover up evidence of the barbaric bombardments by the U.S. air force and the coalition as fast as possible and to bury the thousands of civilians  liberated  from Islamic State in the ruins.  The U.S.-led coalition says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs against Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq, and investigates any allegations. It has previously denied killing civilians in air strikes on Raqqa, saying its goal is  zero civilian casualties.  ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Polls open as Slovenian president runs for his second mandate,"LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Polls opened in the Slovenian presidential election on Sunday  with incumbent President Borut Pahor running for his second five-year mandate against eight other candidates. Opinion polls had shown that Pahor, who is running as an independent and says his main task is bringing people together, will win most votes but the question remains whether there will be a need for a second election round. If no candidate wins at least 50 percent of votes in the first round, the two candidates with the most votes will compete in a second round on Nov. 12.  Apart from Pahor, the most likely candidate to get into the second round is the mayor of Kamnik Marjan Sarec, who is backed by his own non-parliamentary center-left party Lista Marjana Sarca, opinion polls showed.     A lot will depend upon turnout, upon whether young people will come to vote. In this case Pahor would benefit as he is the king of the Instagram and is therefore more likely to get votes of the young,  Tanja Staric, an analyst at Radio Slovenia, told Reuters. Pahor, 53, who is a former fashion model, is famous for posting his photos on Instagram showing him in his official duties but also in various sports activities. His campaign included 25 days of walking totaling some 700 kilometers (435 miles) between Slovenian cities and villages to meet local people.  He is a former long-time leader of the center-left Social Democrats and had been Slovenian prime minister from 2008 to 2012, in the years which led to the worst financial crisis in Slovenia s history. The country managed to only narrowly avoid an international bailout for its banks in 2013. Although the role is mostly ceremonial, the president leads the army and also nominates several top officials, including the central bank governor. Most of his nominations have to be confirmed by parliament. The election is seen as a possible indication of parties  support before general elections due in June or July next year. Polls are due to close at 1700 GMT with preliminary results expected around 1900 GMT. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Roadside bomb kills seven outside Somali capital Mogadishu,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A roadside bomb killed at least seven people on Sunday - mostly women farmers - in an area outside the Somali capital dominated by Islamist insurgents who have defied public protests to end years of violence, residents and the army said. A truck bombing in Mogadishu last weekend killed at least 358 people, with 56 people still missing. Almost all of the dead were civilians and the attack triggered angry demonstrations in the capital.  Sunday s bombing hit a minibus in Daniga village about 40 km (25 miles) to the northwest of Mogadishu.   We heard a huge crash today and we went to the scene, we saw a ruined minibus and at least seven dead bodies, mostly women. We could not identify some people, they were just pieces of human flesh,  farmer Nur Abdullahi told Reuters by phone. The area of the bombing is close to areas held by al Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked insurgents who want to overthrow the weak U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law.   We are scared,  Abdullahi said  Hundreds of masked militants are everywhere and we anticipate the government will attack here. They also planted mines everywhere and today we pack our clothes to flee.  An army officer said the death toll might be higher.  We know the minibus left Afgooye (town) this morning and it was carrying farmers, mostly women,  said Captain Isa Osman of the Somali National Army.   It was carrying more than 10 people. We cannot get many details because the area is not controlled by government.  After last Saturday s attack, the government promised new offensives against the insurgency.  Somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator then turned on each other.  ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
"Exclusive: Returning Rohingya may lose land, crops under Myanmar plans","SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims who return to Myanmar after fleeing to Bangladesh are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to officials and plans seen by Reuters. Nearly 600,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts sparked a ferocious counteroffensive by the Myanmar army. The United Nations says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since late August amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has no control over the military, has pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return. Reuters has interviewed six Myanmar officials involved with repatriation and resettlement plans. While the plans are not yet finalised, their comments reflect the government s thinking on how Suu Kyi s repatriation pledge will be implemented. Jamil Ahmed, who spoke to Reuters at a refugee camp in Bangladesh, is one of many Rohingya who hope to go back. Describing how he fled his home in northern Rakhine state in late August, Ahmed said one of the few things he grabbed was a stack of papers - land contracts and receipts - that might prove ownership of the fields and crops he was leaving behind.  I didn t carry any ornaments or jewels,  said the 35-year-old.  I ve only got these documents. In Myanmar, you need to present documents to prove everything.  The stack of papers, browning and torn at the edges, may not be enough, however, to regain the land in Kyauk Pan Du village, where he grew potatoes, chilli plants, almonds and rice.  It depends on them. There is no land ownership for those who don t have citizenship,  said Kyaw Lwin, agriculture minister in Rakhine state, when asked in an interview whether refugees who returned to Myanmar could reclaim land and crops. Despite his land holdings, Myanmar does not recognize Ahmed as a citizen. Nearly all the more than 1 million Rohingya who lived in Myanmar before the recent exodus are stateless, despite many tracing their families in the country for generations. Officials have made plans to harvest, and possibly sell, thousands of acres of crops left behind by the fleeing Rohingya, according to state government documents reviewed by Reuters. Myanmar also intends to settle most refugees who return to Rakhine state in new  model villages , rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach criticized in the past by the United Nations as effectively creating permanent camps. The government has not asked for help from any international agencies, who are calling for any repatriation to be voluntary and to the refugees  place of origin. The exodus of 589,000 Rohingya - and about 30,000 non-Muslims - from the conflict zone in northern Rakhine has left some 71,500 acres of planted rice paddy abandoned and in need of harvesting by January, according to plans drawn up by state officials. Tables in the documents, reviewed by Reuters, divide the land into paddy sown by  national races  - meaning Myanmar citizens - or  Bengalis,  a term widely used in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya, but which they reject as implying they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Kyaw Lwin, the state minister, confirmed the plans, and said there was a total of 45,000 acres of  ownerless Bengali land . Two dozen combine harvesters operated by officials from the agriculture ministry will begin cutting stalks this month in areas under military control. The machines will be able to harvest about 14,400 acres according to official calculations contained in the plans. It is unclear what will become of the remaining crop, but officials told Reuters they would try to harvest all the paddy, recruiting additional labor to harvest manually if necessary. An acre of paddy in Myanmar typically makes more than $300 at market, meaning the state will gain millions of dollars worth of rice. The harvested rice will be transported to government stores, where it would either be donated to those displaced by the conflict or sold, Rakhine state secretary Tin Maung Swe told Reuters by phone.  The land was abandoned. There is no one to reap that, so the government ordered to harvest it,  he said. Human Rights Watch (HRW) deputy Asia director Phil Robertson, said the government should at least guarantee that the rice would be used for humanitarian support and not for profit.  You can t call a rice crop  ownerless  just because you used violence and arson to drive the owners out of the country,  he said. Many refugees are fearful to return and are skeptical of Myanmar s guarantees. Those who do decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters, before mostly being relocated to model villages. International donors, who have fed and cared for more than 120,000 mostly Rohingya  internally displaced persons  (IDPs) in supposedly temporary camps in Rakhine since violence in 2012, have told Myanmar that they will not support more camps, according to aid workers and diplomats.  The establishment of new temporary camps or camp-like settlements carries many risks, including that the returnees and IDPs could end up being confined to these camps for a long time,  said U.N. spokesman Stanislav Saling in an emailed response. Satellite imagery shows 288 villages, mostly Rohingya settlements, have been fully or partially razed by fires since Aug. 25, according to HRW.  Refugees say the army and Buddhist mobs were responsible for most of the arson. The government says Rohingya militants and even residents themselves burned the homes for propaganda. The hamlets where Rohingya farmers lived were  not systematic , and so should be rebuilt in smaller settlements of 1,000 households set out in straight rows to enable development, said Soe Aung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement.  In some villages there are three houses here, four houses over there. For example, there s no road for fire engines when fire burns the villages,  Soe Aung said. Those who decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters. At the centers, officials said, the returnees will fill out a 16-point form that will be cross-checked with local authorities  records. Immigration officials have for years visited Rohingya households at least annually for checks, photographing family members. For refugees who lost all their documents, the government would compare their photos to those that immigration authorities have on file, said Myint Kyaing, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population. Officials will accept as evidence  national verification  cards handed out in an ongoing government effort to register Rohingya that falls short of offering them citizenship. The card has been widely rejected by Rohingya community leaders, who say they treat life-long residents like new immigrants.  We are not going to go back like this,  said Mushtaq Ahmed, 57, a farmer from Myin Hlut village now living in the Tenkhali refugee camp in Bangladesh, where Jamil Ahmed is also staying.  If I can go back to my house, and get my land back, only then I will go. We invested all our money into those paddy fields. They are killing so many of us with swords and bullets, and killing the rest of us like this.  ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Thailand rehearses lavish $90 million funeral for late king,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Drums and a band played as officials in black tops and ancient costumes rehearsed on Saturday for the funeral procession of Thailand s late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose cremation next week is expected to be attended by a quarter of a million mourners. Some held a mock-up of a golden urn that had held the remains of dead kings in the past. In the present, the king s body is placed in a coffin but the urn is still used to represent the monarch s remains. The procession rehearsal, which was expected to take up to five hours, passed crowds of black-clad mourners in Bangkok s historic quarter.  Some were visibly moved by the proceedings. Others held gold-framed portraits of the late king. The military government has set 3 billion baht ($90 million) aside for the lavish funeral. Preparations took almost a year to complete, with thousands of artisans working to create an elaborate structure of gold-tipped Thai pavilions in a square in front of the glittering Grand Palace. King Bhumibol, who died on Oct. 13 last year at the age of 87, ruled Thailand for seven decades and is credited by some as having revived the prestige of the monarchy. A revival in the monarchy s popularity was helped by a formidable public relations machine  - the evening news in Thailand includes a daily segment dedicated to the royals and the late king was often featured in his younger days crisscrossing the country to meet the poor and disenfranchised. That public relations drive helped to enshrine the king s status as a demi-god among some of his 68 million subjects. The five-day funeral will be attended by dozens of heads of state including King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck of Bhutan and Japan s Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko, among others. The post-funeral period could be one of uncertainty for many Thais, say analysts, who point to the king s role over the years as a moral compass and arbiter during decades of political upheaval. His only son King Maha Vajiralongkorn formally ascended the throne last year but his coronation will not take place until after his father s funeral. The king s cremation will take place on Oct. 26.  The day has been a declared a national holiday and many businesses have announced they will shut all day or close at midday. More than 10,000 7-Eleven convenience stores across the country, a staple for many Thais, will be shut on the day. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1

Death toll from Malaysia construction site landslide at 11,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Eleven foreign workers were killed in a landslide at a construction site in northwest Malaysia on Saturday, authorities said. Earlier estimates had put the George Town death toll at 14, but three workers had managed to escape, said Ervin Galen Teruki, deputy operations head of the Fire and Rescue Department in Penang state.     A seventh body was found on Sunday morning. Fire officials earlier identified the victims as foreign workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Pakistan. The construction site supervisor, a Malaysian, remains missing. The landslide occured on Saturday morning at a site where two 49-storey condominium towers are being built. The cause has yet to be determined. A stop-work order had been issued for the development, pending investigations, according to the Penang Island city council mayor Maimunah Mohammad Sharif.  Several residential and commercial towers are still under construction in the area.

South Korea's president says will continue phasing out nuclear power,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea s President Moon Jae-in said on Sunday the government will continue to phase out nuclear-generated electricity, following a public opinion survey that dealt a blow to his plans to do so.  We will completely stop all plans for the construction of new nuclear reactors like the government previously stated,  Moon said in a statement distributed to reporters by his office.  The government will also step up usage of natural gas and renewables in order to maintain its stance of phasing out nuclear-generated power.  Moon s statement came after a public opinion survey on Friday found a majority of almost 60 percent in favor of resuming the stalled construction of two reactors. The president asked his supporters on Sunday to respect the outcome of the survey, which he called a  wise and intelligent  response.   Completing the two reactors could mean a reversal of a strategy to slowly reduce nuclear energy s share of the power mix, and also significantly eat into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand of the world s second-largest consumer of the fuel. With the two reactors set to be completed in October 2021 and October 2022, according to state-run nuclear operator Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, Moon said safety standards for nuclear plants would be ramped up. Moon also reiterated his plan to shut down the Wolsong No. 1 nuclear reactor, the nation s second-oldest, once the government confirms stability in energy supplies. The 697-megawatt reactor in southeastern South Korea was taken offline in 2012 after reaching its 30-year lifespan, but the regulator approved a restart a few years ago until 2022. South Korea has 24 nuclear reactors, supplying a third of its electricity. ",worldnews,"October 22, 2017 ",1
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter says would travel to North Korea: NYT,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said he would be willing to travel to North Korea on behalf of the Trump administration to help diffuse rising tensions, The New York Times reported on its website on Sunday.  I would go, yes,  Carter, 93, told the Times when he was asked in an interview at his ranch house in Plains, Georgia whether it was time for another diplomatic mission and whether he would do so for President Trump. Carter, a Democrat who was president from 1977 to 1981, said he had spoken to Trump s National Security Adviser Lt.-Gen. H. R. McMaster, who is a friend, but so far has gotten a negative response.  I told him that I was available if they ever need me,  the Times quoted Carter as saying. Told that some in Washington were made nervous by Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un s war of words, Carter said  I m afraid, too, of a situation.   They want to save their regime. And we greatly overestimate China s influence on North Korea. Particularly to Kim,  who, Carter added, has  never, so far as I know, been to China. And they have no relationship. Kim Jong-il did go to China and was very close to them.  Describing the North Korean leader as  unpredictable,  Carter worried that if Kim thinks Trump will act against him, he could do something pre-emptive, the Times reported.  I think he s now got advanced nuclear weaponry that can destroy the Korean Peninsula and Japan, and some of our outlying territories in the Pacific, maybe even our mainland,  Carter said. In the mid 1990s,  Carter traveled to Pyongyang over the objections of President Bill Clinton, the Times report said, and struck a deal with Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current leader.

Australia to tighten airport security further after foiled attack,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will introduce random searches of workers entering and inside its airports as it increases security after a recent foiled terrorism plot, officials said.  These measures strengthen existing controls to ensure airport workers are authorized, properly identified and appropriately trained before entering secure airside areas,   Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Darren Chester said in a statement Sunday.   They may also be subject to security screening in the course of their duties.  Airport security was tightened in July after police foiled  Islamic-inspired  plans for a bomb attack on an Emirates flight from Sydney.  Police said they arrested four men in city-wide raids on July 28 after one of them days earlier had allegedly tried to bring an improvised explosive device on to a flight. The device was not allowed aboard as it exceeded the baggage weight limit.   Extra screening of hand and checked luggage since the incident has led to some travel delays around the country.  Some of the measures will be obvious to the public, some will not be,  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said at the time.  The Council of Australian Governments earlier this month signed off on a facial biometric agreement to give state and federal police real-time access to passport, visa, citizenship and driver s license images for criminal investigations including those involving suspected terrorists. The prime minister denied the agreement was  Big Brother -style mass surveillance, but the  logical next step .  The alternative is to not use the data at all,  he told the ABC s AM program.   The infrastructure minister s office did not respond Sunday when asked when the latest measures would take effect, but said they would be rolled out to  provide flexibility for airports to ensure continue to function efficiently and effectively .

UK PM May readying concessions on welfare reform - Sunday Telegraph,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is on the verge of making concessions around a key welfare reform that has angered opposition parties as well as members of her own Conservatives, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The government has signaled that it is looking at ways to reduce the waiting time for payments from its new Universal Credit benefits system from six weeks, the newspaper said on Saturday, without citing sources. Last week some lawmakers from May s own party vented their dismay over the government s handling of Universal Credit, which is designed to simplify payments to claimants by consolidating six different types of state benefits into one. The policy was first implemented for a small number of claimants in 2013 under May s predecessor David Cameron, but the expansion of the program has been beset by long delays and criticism that it risks harming vulnerable citizens. Last week the opposition Labour Party won a symbolic vote on a motion calling for the welfare plan to be paused, but May s party avoided a full-blown public rebellion by ordering its lawmakers to abstain, thereby masking the extent of internal unrest. May leads a minority government, propped up by a small Northern Irish party, faced with the task of delivering a smooth departure from the European Union - something which requires a deeply split parliament to approve large amounts of new legislation. Separately, the Independent reported that the government has told energy investors a proposal to cap energy bills could be ditched if it feels that major power companies are doing enough to limit high bills, citing civil servants. May s office was not immediately available for comment on either story. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
"Czech vote winner Babis wants active EU role, not favoring government with extremists","PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Republic must seek partners beyond the central European Visegrad Group to find common ground on issues including migration and food quality, Czech parliamentary election winner Andrej Babis told Reuters. He said the country needs to seek an active role in the European Union and look for allies for a common goal of halting illegal migration. The billionaire businessman, who won 29.6 percent of the vote in this weekend s election, is against deeper EU integration and adoption of the euro, and has raised concerns he may join Poland or Hungary on a collision course with the EU. But he insisted on Saturday that the ANO party which he leads was pro-European and ready to take on an active role in the EU.  We have to prepare topics, propose to the European Council (of EU leaders) what we want to change. Double food quality, solution to migration, the fight against migration and other issues,  Babis told Reuters in a brief interview at ANO headquarters after the election results were counted.  We certainly have an ally in Austria, Mr Kurz, who has the same view as we do on migration,  he said, referring to Austrian conservative election victor Sebastian Kurz.  The Visegrad group must find other allies, we need Austria and other countries, in the Balkans, or Slovenia, Croatia and perhaps others,  Babis added. ANO won 78 seats in the 200-seat lower house and will need partners to form a majority. Several parties have however rejected joining an ANO-led government because they say Babis poses a threat to democracy due to his accumulation of business and political power. Some said they could not join a cabinet led by Babis personally because he faces fraud charges over a 2-million-euro subsidy a decade ago. He denies wrongdoing.    This has led to the possibility that, failing other options, Babis may form a government which would depend on parliamentary support from the Communist Party or the far-right, anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy party. Babis said this was something he did not want to do.  I do not want to cooperate with them,  he told Reuters.  We have invited everyone for talks. We want to hear all arguments at a table; the arguments they have (mainstream parties against joining a coalition) ... they don t need to worry when they come with us.

"Portuguese protest over deadly forest fires, government pledges aid","LISBON (Reuters) - As thousands of Portuguese protested on Saturday over the government s  handling of massive wildfires that have killed 108 people since June, government ministers pledged to spend over 400 million euros ($470 million) in aid. The decision, announced during a special cabinet meeting which continued into the night, came on the same day as a new interior minister took over after his predecessor resigned, and ahead of Tuesday s parliamentary vote on a motion of no-confidence launched by the opposition. Earlier thousands of protesters gathered on Lisbon s main Comercio square, in Porto and other cities to mourn the victims of the Portugal s worst tragedy in living memory and demand better fire prevention policies in the country, which despite its relatively small size has suffered the largest forest fires in Europe this year.  Enough! Too many deaths, too much destruction!  read many slogans. A few called for the government s resignation. The cabinet considered a detailed report by independent experts on the first wave of forest fires in June when 64 people died in central Portugal, and the first official accounts of the more widespread fires on Oct. 15-16, which killed 44. The main report pointed to failures on practically every level from fire prevention and monitoring during an unusually hot and dry summer to civil protection response, emergency communications and the alerting of the population. The government decided on Saturday to hire hundreds of forest sappers to maintain forests and to prevent fires, ordered a major clean-up of safety strips along motorways and railroads and promised to support the collection of forest waste for biorefineries. The state will also take a sizeable stake in the emergency communications network SIRESP, whose equipment failed on many occasions during the fires. Another likely measure would put the air force in charge of firefighting aircraft which are currently hired and managed by the civil protection service, local media said. The promised state aid for affected areas includes paying  compensation to the families who lost relatives and homes, funding for reconstruction works and support to save local jobs.   The minority Socialist government has been weakened by the public clamor, but the impact on its strong approval ratings achieved due to an improving economy has been limited so far. Also, the support of its left-wing allies in parliament means the no-confidence motion is not expected to be passed. An opinion poll by Aximage pollsters for Correio da Manha daily, which surveyed 603 people on Oct. 14-17, showed support for the Socialists had dropped by 1.1 percentage points to 41.9 percent, still far ahead of the closest rival, at 23.8 percent.

Gunmen kill 13 Niger gendarmes in attack near Mali border,"NIAMEY (Reuters) - Gunmen on pick-up trucks and motorcycles coming from Mali killed 13 gendarmes and wounded five more in an attack on their base in western Niger, security sources said on Saturday. The village is a few dozen kilometers (miles) from where militants killed four U.S. soldiers in an ambush on Oct. 4 that has thrown a spotlight on a U.S. counter-terrorism mission in Niger, a country that straddles an expanse of the Sahara. Niger s military officials confirmed the attack. The assailants crossed over the border from Mali and drove up to the village of Ayorou, about 40 km (25 miles) inside, before springing their attack, the security sources said.   They were heavily armed. They had rocket launchers and machine guns. They came in four vehicles each with about seven fighters,  said a security source on the scene. Reinforcements later arrived and stopped them as they tried to cross back over the border, another security source on the scene said, triggering a gun battle. They escaped into Mali and were being pursued, he added.   Land and air forces are pursuing the assailants with a view to neutralising them,  a statement from Niger s military said, confirming the death toll. In the initial attack one of the assailants was killed in an exchange of fire but others managed to make off with four Nigerien army vehicles, the first security source said. Since taking over swathes of northern Mali in 2012, and then being scattered by a French-led counter-offensive the following year, Islamist militants have established themselves in lawless spaces across the desert.  They have used these areas as a springboard for a wave of attacks that threaten to destabilize West Africa. Fighters have inflicted damage on military outposts, killed security officials and civilians, kidnapped Westerners and sometimes mounted high-profile attacks on hotels and resorts across the region, including in Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast. Several Islamist groups and well-armed ethnic militia operate in the area along the Mali-Niger border. There have been at least 46 attacks there since early last year. However, officials suspect many of them, including the ambush on the joint U.S.-Niger patrol, to be the work of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, led by Arabic-speaking north African militant Adnan Walid al-Sahrawi.  He has pledged allegiance to Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, although the extent of their ties are not known. No group has yet claimed responsibility for Saturday s attack, nor the one that killed the U.S. soldiers.     Responding to its ever growing militant threat, Mali on Saturday announced a year extension of a state of emergency.  I hope we won t need to continue extending the state of emergency,  Defence Minister Tiena Coulibaly told reporters.  We hope that before Oct. 31, 2018, order will be restored.    The increasingly fluid, cross-border nature of the militant threat forced the Sahel countries Mali, Niger, Chad, Mauritania and Burkina Faso to launch a joint force   known as  G5 Sahel    in July, to try better coordinate policing their deserts. But it has yet to receive a commitment to more than a fraction of the donor funding that it needs. A U.N. Security Council delegation was in Mali on Saturday to discuss the force.  This tragedy is one more element that ... underlines the urgency of a strong and determined response through the creation of the joint G5 Sahel force,  French permanent representative to the U.N. Francois Delattre told journalists during the meetings.  ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
U.N. ends month-long Libya talks in Tunisia without proposing new date,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Month-long U.N.-backed talks aimed at bridging differences between rival Libyan factions ended on Saturday with no discernable progress towards stabilizing the country and paving the way for elections.  A month ago U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame, the latest in a series of Libya envoys since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising ended Muammar Gaddafi s 42-year rule, announced a one-year action plan for a transition toward presidential and parliamentary elections. Since then the U.N. has hosted in Tunis delegations from rival parliaments from eastern Libya and Tripoli, which are meant to draw up amendments to a previous U.N.-mediated plan signed in December 2015. But at the end of a second round of talks Salame said only that discussions would continue, without giving a new date.  There are some area of consensus ... but there are parts which need discussions with the political leaderships inside Libya,  Salame told reporters, without giving details. Delegates will return to Libya on Sunday, the U.N. mission said in a statement. Salame will go to Tripoli next week to discuss how to move the talks forward, a U.N. source added. The North African country has been in turmoil since Gaddafi s downfall gave space to Islamist militants and smuggling networks that have sent hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe. Political and military fractures have left the country mired in conflict and the OPEC member s economy in freefall. Rival parliaments and governments have vied for power. The U.N. tried a similar approach in 2015 of hosting Libyans in luxury hotels abroad but the deal never won support from the power-brokers and factions aligned with military commander Khalifa Haftar that control eastern Libya. Haftar is just one of many players in Libya controlled by armed groups divided among political, religious, regional and business lines. A U.N. source said a major obstacle at the Tunis talks had been how to integrate Haftar, who is opposed by many in western Libya, in any deal and whether he would control a future national army. Western states have tried to work with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, but it has been hamstrung by internal splits and been unable to halt a slide in living standards or tame the power of armed groups. Under the new U.N. plan, once amendments have been agreed a national conference is meant to approve the members of a transitional government that would run the country until elections.

"Yemeni PM says fishermen have seized Iranian vessel, sailors","DUBAI (Reuters) - An Iranian vessel with 19 sailors on board has been seized near a Yemeni island by local fishermen, Yemen s prime minister said on Saturday. There was no immediate official Iranian reaction to the comments made by Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr on his Twitter account in which he said the ship was detained off the coast of Socotra, the largest island in an archipelago south of Yemen.  He thanked the fishermen of another island in the archipelago, Abd al-Kuri, which lies to the east of Somalia. Iran s semi-official Fars news agency said that the Yemeni government, which Tehran does not recognize, had  claimed  that an Iranian vessel with a crew of 19 had been seized on Friday. There were no further details on the ship or its cargo. Regional and Western sources have said that Iran is sending advanced weapons and military advisers to Yemen s rebel Houthi movement, stepping up support for its Shi ite ally in the country s civil war. Iran rejects accusations from Saudi Arabia that it is giving financial and military support to the Houthis, blaming the crisis on Riyadh. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
"Billionaire Babis scores big Czech election win, seeks partners to rule","PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech billionaire Andrej Babis won a thumping victory in Saturday's election as voters shunned traditional parties and gave a mandate to the anti-establishment businessman pledging to fight political corruption while facing fraud charges himself.(For a graphic of the Czech election click tmsnrt.rs/2vO4hPW) Babis s ANO movement got 29.6 percent of the vote, nearly three times as much as anyone else in an election that saw a record nine parties secure seats in parliament s lower house. He now faces the tricky task of finding willing government partners ready to overlook his legal troubles and domineering manner. ANO is the first party to break a quarter century of dominance by two mainstream centre-right and centre-left parties, highlighting a shift in Europe where a refugee crisis has helped the rise of protest groups. Babis has promised to bring his business expertise to government. He pledges to resist deeper integration of the European Union and any efforts in Brussels to force the country of 10.6 million to take in refugees. The dramatic power shift comes as the Czech Republic has enjoyed rapid economic growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the EU. Wages are growing at their fastest rate in a decade. But unlike ANO, the Social Democrats   who led a government with ANO and another partner since 2014   failed to capitalise on that, and had their worst showing, at 7.3 percent, since the country peacefully split from Slovakia in 1993. Two other protest movements   the Pirate party courting unhappy liberals and the far-right, anti-EU SPD    surged to almost 11 percent each, making them, respectively, the third and fourth largest parliamentary players. Babis faces tough negotiations after former partners the Social Democrats and centrist Christian Democrats both said on Saturday they could not be in a cabinet with anyone under police investigation. The runner-up centre-right Civic Democrats also ruled out a government with ANO as well as two other small factions.  Babis was undeterred and said he would talk to all parties.  I believe we will build a government that will be one team,  Babis told supporters and journalists at his party s headquarters.  We want to fulfil our programme for a better life in our country.    Drawing comparisons with U.S. President Donald Trump for his business background and anti-establishment message, Babis has maintained his popularity despite charges he illegally received a 2 million euro EU subsidy when he ran his food, agriculture and chemical empire, worth an estimated $4 billion, before entering politics. He has denied wrongdoing and has also fought back against rivals questioning his past business practices and accusations of conflicts of interest.  His holdings, including interests in national newspapers and a radio station, were placed in a trust earlier this year. Babis s tough EU line and refusal to adopt the euro until the currency zone reforms have played well with eurosceptic Czechs but raised the prospect he may join Hungary and Poland on a collision course with the bloc. But he also supports EU membership and does not share the relatively illiberal ideology of Budapest and Warsaw.   On Saturday, he said his party was pro-European despite reservations about talk of a two-speed Europe that could sideline countries like the Czech Republic which are not using the euro.  It is not true that we are any threat. We are pro-European!  Babis said.  I am ready to fight for our interests in Brussels.  At home, he has promised to use growth of over 3 percent to cut sales tax, lower income tax for most workers and ease the burden on companies. He pledges to build more highways in the next four years than what was completed in the past decade.  Whether he can find support for this programme is still a question. If coalition talks with mainstream parties fail, there is also the possibility ANO will form a cabinet with backing from the Communists or the far-right SPD.  President Milos Zeman has said he would allow a month for negotiations before calling a new parliament, the trigger for the current administration to depart.  He told online news website parlamentnilisty.cz he would not object to Babis forming a government even while facing police charges. He also said he would have no objections to talks involving SPD or the Communists. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
Far-right scores surprise success in Czech election,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - A far-right party whose leader wants to quit the EU and urged Czechs to walk pigs near mosques and stop eating kebabs, performed surprisingly well in an election, potentially giving it a chance to influence how the next government is formed. The Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party rode a wave of far-right sentiment in Europe in an election that ravaged the more established political parties and looked set to hand power to maverick tycoon Andrej Babis. The SPD was set up in 2015 by Tomio Okamura, a half-Japanese entrepreneur who made his name by creating an off-beat travel agency for cuddly toys before entering politics.  We want to stop any Islamisation of the Czech Republic, we push for zero tolerance of migration,  Okamura told reporters after his party won just under 10.7 percent of the vote, almost neck-and-neck with two other parties who were runners-up to Babis s ANO party. Okamura was first elected to the lower house for the Dawn party, which fought to install direct voting for most political posts and won 6.9 percent in the 2013 election, He was later ousted in a spat over irregularities in party finances. This time around, Okamura pounced on anti-foreigner feeling that has soared in the nation of 10.6 million, despite record-low unemployment, growing wages and relatively little immigration.   I voted for SPD because their opinions are close to mine, I am also against migrants arriving here,  said Pavel, an unemployed worker, leaving a polling station in Prague.  Okamura has also played on euroscepticism among many voters and attacked the Roma minority.  The European Union can t be reformed. It only dictates to us. We refuse the multicultural European superstate. Let s leave the EU,  Okamura said at a party leaders  debate just before polls opened on Friday. Born to a Czech mother and Japanese father, Okamura grew up in both the Czech Republic and Japan. He later sold popcorn at cinemas in Japan and ran a travel agency which took clients  plush toys around the sights of the Czech Republic. He was not always on the extreme right. Political analysts say he began courting voters with more hardline views after forming the SPD in 2015. In 2011, Okamura was on a jury at the Miss Expat beauty pageant, featuring immigrants to the country. Two years later he posted a picture of his Czech girlfriend wearing Islamic dress to enter a mosque in London as he praised the assistance she received there, calling it a  fine experience .   When he (Okamura) established his first party, he based it on direct democracy and punishment for bad politicians. Only after his ousting did he add the cheapest thing, the  virtual threat  of migration,  said Pavel Saradin, political science lecturer at the Palacky University in Olomouc. Saradin called the threat  virtual  as the Czech Republic was bypassed by the immigration wave seen elsewhere in Europe in the last two years and has only a tiny Muslim minority.  But the anti-immigrant message Okamura seized on has had wider backing in the Czech society, with all major political parties rejecting a quota system for redistributing migrants that have arrived in the European Union.  President Milos Zeman, formerly leader of the pro-European center-left Social Democrats, shared the podium with far-right anti-immigration activists during the 2015 celebrations of the country s democratic revolution. This weekend s election winner Babis, himself a rich businessman, will need partners to form a government.  Given that he faces fraud charges   which he says are trumped-up   several mainstream parties have already rejected being in government with him. This could potentially make an opening for the SPD which could supply its votes to back Babis s administration in return for policy concessions.  ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1

Turkey bank regulator dismisses 'rumors' after Iran sanctions report,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey s banking regulator urged the public on Saturday to ignore rumors about financial institutions, in an apparent dismissal of a report that some Turkish banks face billions of dollars of U.S. fines over alleged violations of Iran sanctions.  It has been brought to the public s attention that stories, that are rumors in nature, about our banks are not based on documents or facts, and should not be heeded,  the BDDK banking regulator said in a statement, adding that Turkey s banks were functioning well. The Haberturk newspaper on Saturday reported that six banks potentially face substantial fines, citing senior banking sources. It did not name the banks. One bank faces a penalty in excess of $5 billion, while the rest of the fines will be lower, it said. Asked to comment, a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury, which is responsible for U.S. sanctions regimes, said only:  Treasury doesn t telegraph intentions or prospective actions.   Two senior Turkish economy officials told Reuters Turkey has not received any notice from Washington about such penalties, adding that U.S. regulators would normally inform the finance ministry s financial crimes investigation board. U.S. authorities have hit global banks with billions of dollars in fines over violations of sanctions with Iran and other countries in recent years.  The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with a nuclear deal struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany under his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump argues the deal was too lenient and has effectively left its fate up to the U.S. Congress, which might try to modify it or bring back U.S. sanctions previously imposed on Iran. Last week, the U.S. Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said Trump s strategy involved placing additional sanctions on Tehran and that Washington had been  engaging our allies and partners  with the aim of denying funds to Iran s Revolutionary Guard Corps.  The Haberturk report comes as relations between Washington and Ankara, which are NATO allies, have been strained by a series of diplomatic rows, prompting both countries to cut back issuing visas to each other s citizens.  U.S. prosecutors last month charged a former Turkish economy minister and the ex-head of a state-owned bank with conspiring to violate Iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran s behalf. President Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed the charges as politically motivated, and tantamount to an attack on the Turkish Republic. The charges stem from the case against Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was arrested in the United States over sanctions evasion last year. Erdogan has said U.S. authorities had  ulterior motives  in charging Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
"Trump: Raqqa fall 'critical breakthrough', end of Islamic State in sight","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday hailed the defeat of Islamic State fighters in their self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa  as  a critical breakthrough  in a worldwide campaign against the militants. On Friday, the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) formally announced Raqqa s liberation from Islamic State after four months of battles and said the city would be part of a decentralized federal Syria.  Together, our forces have liberated the entire city from ISIS control,  Trump said in a statement.    The defeat of ISIS in Raqqa represents a critical breakthrough in our worldwide campaign to defeat ISIS and its wicked ideology. With the liberation of ISIS s capital and the vast majority of its territory, the end of the ISIS caliphate is in sight.  Trump said the U.S. campaign against Islamic State, which was launched by his predecessor Barack Obama, would soon enter a new phase, in which the United States would  support local security forces, de-escalate violence across Syria, and advance the conditions for lasting peace, so that the terrorists cannot return to threaten our collective security again.   Together, with our allies and partners, we will support diplomatic negotiations that end the violence, allow refugees to return safely home, and yield a political transition that honors the will of the Syrian people,  he said. Trump s statement made no mention of the future of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He also did not spell out how the United States would support local security forces. A White House spokesman said U.S. policy towards Assad  remains the same.  U.S. officials have said Assad has no future governing Syria and U.S. envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said last month a stable Syria was not possible while he remained in place. The fight against Islamic State has taken place amid a wider, multi-sided civil war between Assad s government, which is backed by Iran and Russia, and an array of rebel groups supported by other powers, including the United States. Experts believe the defeat of ISIS at Raqqa may only be the start of a wider struggle by the United States to contain any insurgency launched by the militant group and to stabilize the region, as Washington grapples with defining a comprehensive strategy in Syria. On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said France s military would continue its fight against Islamic State in Syria, but that the fall of the militant group s bastion in Raqqa needed to lead to an inclusive political system to restore stability.

Malta offers 1 million-euro reward to find journalist's killers,"VALLETTA (Reuters) - Malta s government said on Saturday it was offering a reward of 1 million euros ($1.2 million) for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the death of prominent journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.  This is a case of extraordinary importance which requires extraordinary measures,  the government said in a statement. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had told parliament on Wednesday the government would offer a  substantial  reward to anyone with information about the crime but did not say how much would be paid. Caruana Galizia, who regularly criticized Muscat in her popular blogs, was killed on Monday by a bomb, which tore apart her car as she was driving away from her home on the southern Mediterranean island. The journalist ran a popular blog in which she relentlessly highlighted cases of alleged high-level corruption, targeting politicians from across party lines, including Muscat. On Thursday the Caruana Galizia family said they had been informed of the government s plans for a reward but they were refusing to endorse it.  We are not interested in justice without change,  Caruana Galizia s sons Matthew, Andrew and Paul said.   Justice, beyond criminal liability, will only be served when everything that our mother fought for   political accountability, integrity in public life and an open and free society   replaces the desperate situation we are in,  they said.  They also called on the prime minister to resign and said his last act before doing so should be to replace the Police Commissioner and the Attorney General for failing to act over their mother s claims of corruption.  A group of NGOs called the  Civil Society Network  is planning to hold a national protest against the killing on Sunday. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1

"Tillerson lands in Riyadh at start of Gulf, South Asia tour","RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Riyadh on Saturday to attend a landmark meeting between officials from Saudi Arabia and Iraq aimed at improving relations between the two countries and countering Iran s growing regional influence. The chief U.S. diplomat flew into King Salman Air Base a little more than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a strategy to contain Iran and compel Tehran to agree to close what he charged are flaws in the multinational 2015 deal designed to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons. Tillerson s only official meeting on Saturday was a working dinner with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. He was stopping in Saudi Arabia on the first leg of a six-day trip that will also take him to Qatar, Pakistan, India and Switzerland. His talks in Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia and in Qatar were expected to be dominated by the topic of Shi ite-dominated Iran s growing regional influence. Iran-backed militias have helped turn the tide of Syria s civil war in the government s favor and they have played leading roles in Iraq s battle to recapture Islamic State s self-declared  caliphate.  This week they aided Iraqi security forces in seizing the oil-rich area of the northern city of Kirkuk as part of an effort to crush a bid for independence made by the Kurdish minority. Washington and Riyadh also allege that Iran is supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen against pro-government forces that are supported by a Saudi-led military coalition backed by the United States. Yemen s grinding civil war was expected to be high on Tillerson s agenda. On Sunday Tillerson is due to attend the inaugural session of the Saudi-Iraqi Coordination Council, a body whose creation was promoted by the Trump administration to improve relations between Saudi Arabia, Iran s main regional rival, and Iraq, whose majority Shi ite-dominated government has close ties with Tehran. During his visit Tillerson is also expected to explore the possibility of renewing a push to end a diplomatic and economic boycott of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and other U.S. Arab allies, although he has conceded he is not optimistic. In an interview on Thursday with Bloomberg, Tillerson blamed Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt for the lack of progress toward ending the four-month-old crisis. Saudi Arabia and its allies have accused Qatar of supporting hardline Islamist groups and cozying up to Iran at the region s expense. Doha denies the allegations.  It s up to the leadership of the quartet when they want to engage with Qatar because Qatar has been very clear - they are ready to engage,  said Tillerson, who forged close ties to the Gulf Arab countries in his former position as CEO of Exxon Mobil. A senior UAE official said on Saturday it was up to Qatar to end the crisis ahead of a summit of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council in December.  The ball is in its court and it is aware of what is required of it,  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his Twitter account. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
"Suicide bombers attack two Afghan mosques, at least 72 dead","KABUL (Reuters) - Suicide bombers attacked two mosques in Afghanistan on Friday, killing at least 72 people including children, officials and witnesses said. One bomber walked into a Shi ite Muslim mosque in the capital Kabul as people were praying on Friday night and detonated an explosive, one of the worshippers there, Mahmood Shah Husaini, said. At least 39 people died in the blast at the Imam Zaman mosque in the city s western Dasht-e-Barchi district, interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, but a statement from the group did not provide evidence to support its claim. Shi ite Muslims have suffered a series of attacks in Afghanistan in recent months, many of them claimed by the Sunni Muslim militants of IS. Separately, a suicide bombing killed at least 33 people at a mosque in central Ghor province, a police spokesman said. The attack appeared to target a local leader from the Jamiat political party, according to a statement from Balkh provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor, a leading figure in Jamiat.

"Ramping up rhetoric, Turkey's Erdogan chastises U.S. over democracy","ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan showed no retreat from a diplomatic row with the United States on Saturday, castigating Washington for what he said an  undemocratic  indictment against his security detail. His comments may further dash hopes of a quick resolution to an on-going diplomatic crisis between the NATO allies. Both Ankara and Washington have cut back issuing visas to each other s citizens as ties have worsened.  They say the United States is the cradle of democracy. This can t be true. This can t be democracy,  Erdogan said in a speech in Istanbul.   If arrest warrants are issued against my bodyguards in absentia ... in the United States, where I went upon invitation, excuse me but I will not say this is a civilized country.  A U.S. grand jury in August indicted 15 Turkish security officials over a brawl between protesters and Erdogan s security personnel during the Turkish president s visit to Washington in May. Erdogan has said the indictment was not binding for Ankara. The row deepened after Turkish authorities arrested two U.S. consular staff, both Turkish nationals. In May, a translator at the consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and two weeks ago a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) worker was detained in Istanbul. Both are accused of links to last year  failed coup. The U.S. embassy has said the accusations are baseless. Turkish police want to question a third worker based in Istanbul. His wife and daughter were detained this month last week over alleged links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the abortive putsch. They were later released. Turkey has been angered by what it sees as U.S. reluctance to hand over the cleric Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999. U.S. officials have said its courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition. Turkey has also been enraged by Washington s support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). On Saturday, the U.S. embassy issued statement reiterating its stance on the PKK and its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in an apparent response to criticism from Erdogan.  The U.S. government works together with Turkey in the fight against terrorism and maintenance of stability in the region,  it said on Twitter.  The PKK is listed among foreign terror organizations. Ocalan has been jailed in Turkey for his actions related to the PKK. He is not a person to be respected.  On Friday, Erdogan criticized the United States over a huge banner of jailed Kurdish militant leader Abdullah Ocalan unfurled in Syria s Raqqa by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. The banner was raised at a ceremony to mark Raqqa s capture from Islamic State in a campaign spearheaded by the YPG.  How can the U.S. explain the poster of Ocalan in Raqqa? Is this the way they are cooperating with us in the struggle against terror?  Erdogan said.  You are not standing by us against terrorism.  Ocalan has been in jail in Turkey since 1999 on a treason conviction. More than 40,000 people, most of them Kurds, have died in the fighting since the PKK took up arms against the state in 1984.  The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
Critics urge WHO to reverse choice of Mugabe as goodwill envoy,"GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) should overturn its decision to appoint Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador, global health leaders said on Saturday, describing the move as unjustifiable and wrong. Britain said Mugabe s appointment was  surprising and disappointing  and added that it risked overshadowing the WHO s global work. The United States, which has imposed sanctions on Mugabe for alleged human rights violations, said it was  disappointed.   This appointment clearly contradicts the United Nations  ideals of respect for human rights and human dignity,  a U.S. State Department spokesperson said.   This selection underscores why the United States continues to push for U.N. reform and leadership actions that uphold our shared U.N. ideals.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uruguay on Wednesday. The meeting was attended by Mugabe, 93. He is blamed in the West for destroying his country s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister. In a speech, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as  a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide health care to all . The former Ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last May as WHO s first African director-general, added:  Today I am also honored to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs.  But the NCD Alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was  shocked and deeply concerned  to hear of the appointment, given Mugabe s  long track record of human rights violations . Jeremy Farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity also said the decision was  deeply disappointing and wrong  and called on Tedros to be brave and reverse it.  Robert Mugabe fails in every way to represent the values WHO should stand for and those that Dr Tedros has stood for since becoming DG and has done over many years,  Farrar said.  Brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,  he said. WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the WHO chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency s work.   Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health,  he said by e-mail.  Human rights activists also criticized the move.  Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based group UN Watch described the choice by WHO, a United Nations agency as  sickening .  The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of Africa   and its health system   into a basket-case,  he said. He noted that Mugabe himself had traveled to Singapore for medical treatment three times this year rather than in his homeland. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1

"Car bomb kills 15 Afghan cadets, trainers outside Kabul military school","KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide attacker rammed a car full of explosives into a bus leaving Afghanistan s top military training center in Kabul on Saturday, killing at least 15 soldiers, including cadets and their trainers, officials said. Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack, the latest in a particularly deadly week for Afghanistan s security forces. The bombing was also the second major attack in the capital Kabul in 24 hours after a suicide attack at a Shi ite mosque killed more than 50 worshippers on Friday night.  Army personnel were coming out of Marshal Fahim University when a suicide bomber in a car targeted them. Fifteen soldiers who were there for training were killed and four others were wounded,  Ministry of Defence spokesman Dawlat Wazari said. A statement from President Ashraf Ghani s office said the bus was carrying trainers and cadets from the defense university on the western outskirts of Kabul that is home to the Afghan military s officer training school and other military academies. Afghan security forces have been struggling against the Taliban since most foreign troops left at the end of 2014. U.S. President Donald Trump committed to an open-ended military training and support mission in Afghanistan in August,  despite criticism that it is no closer to peace despite billions of dollars in aid and nearly 16 years of U.S. and allied operations. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for Saturday s car bomb in an email to reporters.  The Taliban have been waging an insurgency for a decade and a half in an attempt to overthrow the Western-backed government in Kabul and re-establish a fundamentalist Islamist regime. The insurgents now control or contest about 40 percent of Afghanistan.  Afghan security forces including police were being killed at a rate of about 600 per month in battles and targeted bombings earlier this year, according to a U.S. report. This week s toll looked to be particularly heavy for Afghan forces after attacks across the country, including Taliban fighters using captured U.S.-provided Humvee vehicles as vehicle bombs to ram into fortified compounds. On Thursday the Taliban stormed a military base in the southern province of Kandahar, killing at least 43 of the 60 soldiers manning the base, which was left in ruins. Two days earlier dozens of security personnel were killed and scores wounded in Taliban attacks on government compounds in Paktia and Ghazni provinces, with a senior provincial police commander among the dead. In addition to the Taliban, Afghanistan has in recent years seen a rise in violence claimed by fighters who have claimed loyalty to the Islamic State s Middle East-based leadership, although the movement controls little territory in Afghanistan. Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack in Kabul on Friday evening in which a bomber walked into a Shi ite Muslim mosque as people were praying and detonated his explosives. The toll in the attack on Imam Zaman mosque rose to 54 killed, including children, and 55 wounded, a deputy minister for religious affairs, Dai-ul Haq Abid told a news conference on Saturday. Another mosque attack on Friday killed at least 33 people in central Ghor province. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
Israel says it will intensify response to Syrian fire,"JERUSALEM/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Five projectiles from Syria set off air raid sirens in Israeli towns on Saturday, prompting the Israeli military to say it would step up its response to stray fire from the Syrian war that has repeatedly spilled over the border. The projectiles crossed into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the military said it targeted three Syrian artillery guns in response. No damage or injuries were reported in Israel. The Syrian military said it came under attack in Quneitra province, which sits near the Golan Heights territory that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.   The Israeli enemy assaulted one of our military positions this morning, which led to material damages,  it said. During Syria s more than six-year-old conflict, Israel has returned fire across the border, including stray shells from fighting among Syrian combatants.  The Israeli military statement suggested it may start escalating such retaliations.  Whether errant fire or not, any future occurrences will force the Israel Defense Forces to intensify its response,  it said.  Israel  holds the Syrian regime responsible and won t tolerate any attempt to breach Israeli sovereignty,  it added. Syria s foreign ministry warned of  the grave consequences of such repeated aggressive acts  which it called a flagrant violation in a letter to the United Nations, state media said. The Syrian military said it held Israel responsible.  Israel has also carried out targeted air strikes in Syria during the war, alarmed by the expanding influence of Iran, the Syrian government s ally. The Israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah nearly 100 times in recent years. Iran s military chief warned Israel against breaching Syria s airspace and territory on a visit to Damascus this week. The general signed an agreement with his Syrian counterpart to further boost military cooperation, Iranian state news agency IRNA said on Saturday.  Rebel factions fighting the Damascus government in the multi-sided war hold swathes of Quneitra, while the army and allied militias control another part of the province.  Both warring Syrian sides accused each other of prompting the Israeli attack on Saturday.  The army said militants in nearby territory fired mortar rounds into the Golan Heights. A rebel official in Quneitra said pro-government fighters had been shelling insurgent-held parts of the province, when some of the shells fell on the Golan Heights. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1

German police rule out terrorism in Munich knife attack,"MUNICH (Reuters) - German police ruled out a political or religious motive behind a knife attack in the city of Munich on Saturday and said a detained man suspected of injuring eight people had mental health problems. The arrest of the suspect in his 30s brought calm back to the streets of the Bavarian capital after a tense morning. Police had asked residents to stay home until they find the attacker who had fled on a bicycle. Munich police chief Hubertus Andrae told a news conference that eight people have been lightly injured in the attack and that the suspect was known to police from previous offences, including burglary.  We have no indication of a terrorist, political, or religious motive,  Andrae said.  I assume it is to do with a psychological disorder of the perpetrator.  Police had earlier said they believe the man, who attacked people at several different locations, acted alone. His victims include a 12-year-old boy and a woman. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
"U.N. torture watchdog ends trip to Rwanda, citing obstruction","KIGALI (Reuters) - The U.N. subcommittee on torture prevention has suspended a  visit to Rwanda, citing obstructions imposed by the government that compromised its fact-finding mission. Rwandan authorities barred the U.N. delegation from accessing some detention sites and made it impossible for them to conduct  private and confidential interviews , a statement from the U.N. body published on Friday said.  The body said it was only the third time in 10 years it had suspended a mission. It called on Rwanda to cooperate with the body and  abide by its international obligations . The incident further mars the human rights record of the government led by President Paul Kagame, which faces mounting criticism for what human rights groups say are widespread abuses, a muzzling of independent media, and suppression of political opposition. The U.N. body said the people the group interviewed before suspending its seven-day mission said they feared reprisals.  We must not place the persons that have cooperated with us in danger,  it said. The Rwandan authorities were not immediately available for a comment, but it has denied accusations of unlawful detention and torture documented most recently by Human Rights Watch in a report published this month. The report said the government routinely tortured detainees with beatings, asphyxiations, mock executions and electric shocks. A prominent critic of Rwandan president who was barred from running for presidency, Diane Shima Rwigara, was detained in Kigali in September and faces charges of forgery of electoral documents and inciting insurrection.  She said in court last week said that her family and supporters were subjected to torture. Judges have said they will rule on her bail request on Monday. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
India cenbank says linking national ID number to bank accounts mandatory,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India s central bank on Saturday dismissed media reports that it was not necessary to link national identity card numbers, known as Aadhar numbers, to bank accounts. It said in a statement the requirement remained in force under anti-money laundering rules.  The Reserve Bank clarifies that, in applicable cases, linkage of Aadhaar number to bank account is mandatory under the Prevention of Money-laundering (Maintenance of Records) Second Amendment Rules, 2017,  it said in a statement. The RBI also said that anti-money laundering rules announced in June 2017 have  statutory force  and banks have to implement them without awaiting further instructions. The Aadhar program, which is the world s largest biometric identity card program, has triggered some claims that it is an infringement of privacy of citizens. India s top court in August had said that privacy is a fundamental right and the verdict was expected to complicate efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government to make linking of the ID card numbers with bank accounts, telephone numbers, etc. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
"Kremlin says Putin, Erdogan discuss Syria in phone call","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan discussed an upcoming meeting of the Astana process on the Syrian conflict in the Kazakh capital in late October, the Kremlin said on Saturday. During their phone conversation, Putin and Erdogan talked about joint efforts within the Astana process, including the  creation of  de-escalation zones  in Syria, and further coordination towards resolving the Syria situation, the Kremlin said in a statement. The Astana talks are brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran. In mid-September, the three countries agreed to post observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in northern Syria s Idlib region largely controlled by Islamist militants. Putin and Erdogan also said the agreements reached between Russia and Turkey in Ankara in late September were being successfully implemented, particularly in trade and economic relations.  Overall, the conversation was business-like and constructive, directed at strengthening bilateral cooperation and interaction on the regional agenda,  the Kremlin said. The Russian-Turkish trade relationship has been affected by their dispute over supplies of Turkish tomatoes to Russia which Moscow is yet to fully restore. This dispute has been adding risks to Russian grain trade with Turkey. Russia, once the largest market for Turkish tomato producers, said this week it will allow purchases of 50,000 tonnes of Turkish tomatoes from only four Turkish producers from Dec. 1. The announcement came several days after Turkey, the second largest buyer of Russian wheat, said it had imposed a requirement for additional approval of Russian agriculture supplies by the Turkish authorities.

China says no excuses for foreign officials meeting Dalai Lama,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Foreign leaders can t think they can get away with meeting exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama just because they are doing it in a personal capacity, as they still represent their government, a senior Chinese official said on Saturday. China considers the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, to be a dangerous separatist. The Nobel Peace Prize winning monk says he simply seeks genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland. Visits by the Dalai Lama to foreign countries infuriate China, and fewer and fewer national leaders are willing to meet him, fearing the consequences of Chinese anger, though some have tried to placate Beijing by saying they are meeting him in a personal not official capacity. Zhang Yijiong, who heads the Communist Party s Tibet working group, told reporters on the sidelines of a party congress that there could be no excuses to meeting the Dalai Lama.  Although some people say, the Dalai is a religious figure, our government didn t put in an appearance, it was just individual officials, this is incorrect,  said Zhang, who is also a vice minister at the United Front Work Department, which has led failed talks with the Dalai Lama s representatives.  Officials, in their capacity as officials, attending all foreign-related activities represent their governments. So I hope governments around the world speak and act with caution and give full consideration their friendship with China and their respect for China s sovereignty,  he added.  China took control of Tibet in 1950 in what it calls a  peaceful liberation  and has piled pressure on foreign governments to shun the Dalai Lama, using economic means to punish those who allow him in. China strongly denies accusations of rights abuses in Tibet, saying its rule has brought prosperity to what was a remote and backward region, and that it fully respects the religious and cultural rights of the Tibetan people. China also insists that Tibet in an integral part of its territory and has been for centuries. Zhang, who worked in Tibet from 2006-2010 as a deputy Communist Party boss, said that Tibetan Buddhism was a special religion  born in our ancient China .  It s a Chinese religion. It didn t come in from the outside,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
Iraqi forces complete Kirkuk province takeover after clashes with Kurds,"BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi forces on Friday took control of the last district in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk still in the hands of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters following a three-hour battle, security sources said. The district of Altun Kupri, or Perde in Kurdish, lies on the road between the city of Kirkuk - which fell to Iraqi forces on Monday - and Erbil, capital of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq that voted in a referendum last month to secede from Iraq against Baghdad s wishes. A force made up of U.S-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service units, Federal Police and Iranian-backed fighters known as Popular Mobilisation began their advance on Altun Kupri at 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT), said an Iraqi military spokesman. Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew from the town, located on the Zab river, after battling the advancing Iraqi troops with machine guns, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, Iraqi security sources said. Neither side gave information about casualties. The Iraqi central government forces have advanced into Kirkuk province largely unopposed as most Peshmerga forces withdrew without a fight. The government advance has transformed the balance of power in northern Iraq and is likely to scuttle the independence aspirations of the Kurds, who voted overwhelmingly on Sept. 25 to secede from Iraq and take the oil fields of Kirkuk with them.      The fighting at Altun Kupri marked only the second instance of significant violent resistance by the Kurds in Kirkuk province. Dozens were killed or wounded in the previous clash on Monday, the first night of the government advance. The U.S. State Department said it was concerned by reports of violent clashes around Altun Kupri.  In order to avoid any misunderstandings or further clashes, we urge the central government to calm the situation by limiting federal forces  movements in disputed areas to only those coordinated with the Kurdistan Regional Government,  it said in a statement. The State Department made clear that even though federal authority was reasserted over  disputed areas , that in no way changes their status -  they remain disputed until their status is resolved in accordance with the Iraqi resolution  in what appeared to be a nod to the Kurds and their assertion that they have a stake in these territories. Altun Kupri is the last town in Kirkuk province on the road to Erbil, lying just outside the border of the autonomous region established after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants. Iraq s top Shi ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called on Friday for the state to protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a rare political intervention by a figure whose words have the force of law for most of Iraq s Shi ite majority. Sistani s call, issued at the Friday prayer in the holy Shi ite city of Kerbala by one of his representatives, came amid reports of abuses against Kurds in areas evacuated by the Kurdish Peshmerga including Kirkuk, Tuz Khormato and Khanaqin. Kurdish officials said tens of thousands of Kurds fled Kirkuk and Tuz to the two main cities of the Kurdish autonomous region, Erbil and Sulaimaniya. Iraq s post-Saddam constitution allows the Kurds self rule in three mountainous northern provinces and guarantees them a fixed percentage of Iraq s total oil income, an arrangement that saw them prosper while the rest of the country was at war. Although Kirkuk is outside the autonomous region, many Kurds consider it the heart of their historic homeland and its oil to be their birthright. Its loss makes their quest for independence appear remote, since it would leave them with only about half the oil revenue they had sought to claim for themselves. Kurdish Peshmerga moved into Kirkuk without a fight in 2014, taking over positions left by the Iraqi army as it fled in the face of Islamic State militants. Iraqi and Kurdish forces traded accusations of using weapons that Western powers had originally given them to fight Islamic State.  Iraqi forces use U.S. Humvees, tanks in latest offensive against Peshmerga,  tweeted Hemin Hawrami, KRG President Masud Barzani s assistant.  Today, Popular Mobilisation attacked us with American weaponry. What is this agreement between the Americans and the Iranians?  said Harem Shukur, a Peshmerga fighter outside Altun Kupri.  The Americans sold us to Iran,  he added, echoing  widespread bitterness among Kurds who think the United States did not honor friendly ties built over several decades. An Iraqi military spokesman accused the Peshmerga of using rockets supplied by Germany. Germany said it hoped to resume its mission training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq on Sunday, provided the conflict did not worsen. Berlin suspended it last week as tensions mounted.

Iraq increases oil exports from south to make up for Kirkuk shortfall,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq said it was increasing oil exports on Saturday from the southern Basra region by 200,000 barrels per day to make up for a shortfall from the northern Kirkuk fields. The output from the northern Kirkuk region fell this week in the course of military operations to take it back from Kurdish  fighters who have been there since 2014. The increase in Basra exports keeps Iraq s total output within the quota agreed with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil ministry said in a statement citing Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi. He said 200,000 barrels per day will be shipped from southern Basra export terminal on top of the usual volumes exported daily which exceed 3.2 million barrels.  These additional volumes will be produced until the northern oil output goes back to its previous level,  he said. Iraq won t be able to restore Kirkuk s oil output to last week s levels before Sunday because of missing equipment at two of the largest fields of the region, Avana and Bai Hasan, an oil ministry official told Reuters on Thursday. Until these shutdowns, the northern oil region exported about 530,000 barrels per day, of which about half came from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region and the rest from the disputed Kirkuk province, claimed by both the Kurds and the Iraqi central authorities. Kurdish Peshmerga forces deployed in Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi army fled its positions in the face of an advance by Islamic State militants. The Kurdish move prevented the militants from taking control of its oilfields. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
Qantas flight to San Francisco turns back after 'technical issue',"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A Qantas jumbo jet bound for San Francisco was forced to return to Australia on Saturday after a  technical issue  90 minutes into its flight, the airline said.

Thousands rally for gay marriage before Australian postal vote closes,"SYDNEY - (Reuters) - Thousands of people rallied around Australia on Saturday urging the legalization of same-sex marriage, one week before final ballots can be submitted in a contentious postal survey on the issue that has divided the country. The largest crowd was in Sydney, where organizers said between 5,000 and 10,000 people gathered in front of Central Station before marching along one of the city s biggest roads to Victoria Park.  It s a good reflection of the enthusiasm of people,  Australian Marriage Equality s Tiernan Brady said.  They are very determined, very positive and not complacent.  Other rallies in favor of same-sex marriage were held in the northern city of Brisbane and the central hub of Alice Springs. Rallies organized by the Coalition for Marriage, the lead campaigner against same-sex marriage, also were held across the country.  The coalition, which includes the Australian Christian Lobby and other religious groups, encouraged those who haven t returned their surveys to do so.  We re so pleased so many people have engaged with this process and we encourage those who haven t to tick  no  and put it in the post,  spokeswoman Monica Doumit said. Though the postal ballot is non-binding, a  yes  vote is expected to lead to the legalization of same-sex marriage which could further fracture the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Ballots were mailed out from Sept. 12, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics recommending all votes be returned via the postal service by Oct. 27.  The latest update from the ABS, issued on Oct. 17, showed almost 11 million postal votes had been returned, about 68 per cent of the total distributed.  The result is expected on Nov. 15.

Strong typhoon nears southern Japan the day before election,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Heavy rain and powerful winds are expected to lash large areas of Japan on Sunday as a strong typhoon sweeps ashore, possibly hindering voter turnout in a national election. Typhoon Lan was classified as an intense Category 4 storm on Saturday, with winds of up to 250 km/h (156 mph), according to the Tropical Storm Risk web site. By midday, it was south of South Borodino Island, east of Okinawa, and moving northeast at 15 kph, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It is expected to weaken to a Category 1 typhoon as it nears the Tokyo metropolitan area on Monday morning, Tropical Storm Risk said. Authorities in Okinawa and Hyogo prefectures have moved voting ahead a day for some remote islands as the storm neared, media said. Saturday marked the last day of campaigning for the parliament s lower house seats, and bad weather could deter some voters. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s Liberal Democratic Party-led (LDP) coalition is on track to roughly match the two-thirds  super majority  it held in parliament s lower house before dissolution, helped by divisions in the opposition camp and jitters over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, media forecasts have said.

Trump expected to pressure China's Xi to rein in North Korea: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to pressure China s president when they meet next month in Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea out of a belief that Xi Jinping s consolidation of power should give him more authority to do so. Trump leaves Nov. 3 on a trip that will take him to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. It will be his first tour of Asia since taking power in January and one with a major priority: Preventing the standoff with North Korea from spiraling out of control. Xi is immersed in a Communist Party Congress expected to culminate in him consolidating his control and potentially retaining power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place. Trump believes that Xi should have even more leverage to work on the North Korea problem.  The president s view is you have even less of an excuse now,  said one official.  He s not going to step lightly.  Trump wants to gain some serious cooperation from China to persuade Pyongyang to either change its mind or help deprive it of so much resources that it has no choice but to alter its behavior, the official said. Trump has heaped praise on Xi in recent weeks in hopes of gaining Chinese cooperation and has held back from major punitive trade measures. In an interview with Fox Business Network s Maria Bartiromo, Trump said he wants to  keep things very, very low key  with Xi until the Chinese leader emerges from the party congress.  I believe he s got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We ll see what happens. Now with that being said, we re prepared for anything. We are so prepared, like you wouldn t believe,  Trump said in the interview, to air on Sunday. Trump has traded bitter insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, using his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month to dismiss Kim as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission for his repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches. He said if threatened, the United States would  totally destroy  North Korea. Kim in recent weeks said the United States would face an  unimaginable strike  from North Korea if provoked. CIA chief Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that North Korea could be only  months  away from gaining the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
China's Communist Party says still talking to North Korean counterpart,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party continues to hold talks and maintain contacts with its North Korean counterpart, a senior official said on Saturday, describing the two countries friendship as important for regional stability. While the United States and its allies, and many people in China, believe Beijing should do more to rein in Pyongyang, the acceleration of North Korea s nuclear and missile capabilities has coincided with a near-total breakdown of high-level diplomacy between the two. China, Pyongyang s sole major ally, has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. China accounts for more than 90 percent of world trade with the isolated country.  Guo Yezhou, a deputy head of the Chinese Communist Party s international department, told reporters on the sidelines of a party congress that its exchanges, communication and dialogue with the North s ruling Workers  Party of Korea were continuing.  China and North Korea are neighbours and the two have a traditional friendly cooperative relationship,  Guo said. Maintaining, developing and consolidating those ties not only accord with both sides  interests, they also have  important meaning  for regional peace and stability, he added. Exchanges between the two parties play an important role in developing overall China-North Korea relations, Guo said.  Our party and the Workers  Party of Korea have traditional friendly exchanges. When and at what level these exchanges happen depend on both sides need and both sides  convenience,  he added, without elaborating. Guo did not directly answer a question on when the department s head, Song Tao, last met with any North Koreans. The department is in charge of the party s relations with foreign political parties, and has traditionally served as a conduit for Chinese diplomacy with North Korea. The Workers  Party of Korea on Wednesday congratulated China on its 19th Communist Party Congress despite the increasingly frayed relationships between the allies as China tightens sanctions over Pyongyang s nuclear weapons program. Though China has been angered by North Korea s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions with their military drills. North Korea is likely to be at high on the agenda when U.S. President Donald Trump visits China next month for talks with President Xi Jinping. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
Fighting in southern Philippine city may end imminently - military,"MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - The Philippines is preparing to declare the end of fighting in a southern city seized for five months by pro-Islamic State rebels, a top military commander said on Saturday, as troops continued a phased withdrawal from the devastated lakeside city.   Only 20 insurgents remained in a small area in Marawi City, including five  significant  figures, and three battalions of troops were closing in on their positions, said Lieutenant-General Carlito Galvez.     Most probably tomorrow, we can do it,  Galvez told reporters when asked when the military can declare fighting is over.  We can declare it is totally complete.    Galvez said troops are zeroing in on three sons of Isnilon Hapilon, the slain  emir  of Islamic State in Southeast Asia, and two Malaysians, including Amin Baco, who has been central to facilitating the movement of foreign fighters in the region.   We cannot say our mission is totally accomplished or completed if the five persons are still there,  he said, adding the remaining militants are  struggling to survive  and to protect their shrinking position.   Another general told Reuters they were also looking for a prominent Indonesian militant. The military is concerned Hapilon s sons and these foreign fighters could succeed core leaders of the alliance killed this week.    Hapilon and Omarkhayam Maute were killed by commandoes on Monday. Malaysian Mahmud Ahmad, who experts say may have funded the Marawi siege, was also dead, according to a freed hostage, but his body has yet to be found. The defense ministry said on Saturday that forensic tests by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation had confirmed that the man killed was Hapilon. The United States has provided technical support to treaty ally the Philippines, including surveillance drones. The deaths of the leaders could slow down any effort by Islamic State to establish a presence in Mindanao, a vast island with a history of rebellion and home to the predominantly Roman Catholic nation s Muslim minority.  The organization and combat capability of the rebels has stunned the military. Some experts see the siege as a prelude to a more ambitious bid by Islamic State loyalists to exploit Mindanao s poverty and use its jungles and mountains as a base to train, recruit and launch attacks in the region. Galvez, head of the Western Mindanao Command, inspected troops in Marawi and sent off a battalion of marines central to  military operations . It was the second unit to leave the conflict area.   The military declined to divulge the number of troops remaining in Marawi. Elite commandoes were leading the assault, with army infantry battalions and police commandoes securing safe areas.   The military said eleven hostages were  processed  on Saturday to determine whether they were really captives or militant members and sympathizers trying to slip away.   Galvez said rehabilitation, including retrieval of the dead, would start after the end of hostilities is declared. The Philippines estimates the rebuilding of areas battered by months of government air strikes could cost at least 50 billion Philippine pesos ($971 million). ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1
Missing Argentine protester's body identified days before election,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The family of a young protester who went missing in Argentina nearly three months ago identified his body on Friday, said a brother of the dead man to journalists after leaving the morgue.  Investigators discovered a body on Tuesday in the Chubut River in Patagonia, near where Santiago Maldonado was last seen at an indigenous rights protest on Aug. 1.   We recognized Santiago s tattoos so we are convinced it is Santiago,  said Sergio Maldonado, the brother, after the family identified the body in Buenos Aires.  Some government opposition and rights groups have said state security forces took Maldonado, a 28-year-old craftsman, after police reportedly clashed with Mapuche Indians who claim territory throughout southern Argentina and Chile.  The groups allege President Mauricio Macri s government covered up Maldonado s whereabouts. Macri s government says there is no evidence showing security forces detained him.  The disappearance and death of Maldonado has overshadowed Sunday s midterm congressional election in a country where potential cases of abuse by security forces are particularly sensitive.  Argentina s 1976-83 military dictatorship secretly detained, tortured and killed people in clandestine prisons, and rights groups say up to 30,000 people  disappeared.   The judge overseeing the Maldonado case said an autopsy completed late on Friday showed no signs of injury on the body.   Now the cause of death needs to be determined,  Judge Gustavo Lleral told journalists.  Former leftist President Cristina Fernandez, who is seeking a Senate seat in Buenos Aires province, has criticized the government s handling of the case, and mass protests and social media campaigns have demanded to know what happened to Maldonado.  The president s office said on Friday that Macri had contacted Maldonado s mother to offer his condolences.  Mourners left candles, flowers and cards outside the morgue in Buenos Aires, while protesters gathered at the Plaza de Mayo.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1

Graft probe into Mexico president's ally poses tricky challenge ahead of elections,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - With a tight general election looming next year, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto faces a tough choice on whether to pursue a graft probe involving a prominent ally and Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht. Mexico s top prosecutor, acting Attorney General, Alberto Elias Beltran, on Friday fired the federal attorney general responsible for electoral crimes, adding fuel to a case that may complicate the president s efforts to shake off allegations of corruption in the run-up to the July 2018 presidential vote. The dismissal of top electoral prosecutor, Santiago Nieto, came two days after he accused Emilio Lozoya, the former boss of state oil firm Pemex, and a longtime ally of President Pena Nieto, in a newspaper interview of writing to him to ask to be declared innocent of funneling Odebrecht cash to political campaigns. In Brazil, Odebrecht has admitted to paying bribes in several countries in Latin America, including Mexico.  President Pena Nieto s party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), has been the dominant force of Mexican politics for the best part of a century, but has long been a byword for corruption. Mindful that the issue of corruption has become central to the 2018 election, the unpopular PRI has overseen the arrest of various former state governors, but Lozoya poses a more difficult challenge, given his proximity to the president.   If they investigate (Lozoya) deeply, I think it would be the end of the party in power. If they don t, they stir up more public anger,  said Paulo Diez, an anti-corruption lawyer who has taken on the government in high-profile graft scandals. Four days after becoming acting Attorney General, Alberto Elias Beltran dismissed Santiago Nieto on the grounds he had broken the office s code of conduct for public officials, his office said on Friday. The dismissal was attacked by the conservative National Action Party (PAN) and the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), opposition parties which questioned the impartiality of Pena Nieto s government.      Santiago Nieto told newspaper Reforma on Wednesday that Lozoya s letter was a bid to secure  impunity  and that Odebrecht money had entered political campaigns. Nieto s office confirmed the letter s existence, as well as the investigation into the former Pemex chief executive, when contacted by Reuters. Lozoya said in a press conference that he is innocent of all accusations and that he did not funnel cash to President Pena Nieto s campaign.  President Pena Nieto has also previously denied Odebrecht bribes made their way into his party s coffers.  Lozoya s lawyer, Javier Coello, denied his client had written seeking leniency interviews.  Coello also shared with Reuters a letter sent to Santiago Nieto, in which Lozoya asked to be informed of any criminal investigation into him, and to be called to testify if needed. That letter did not mention any appeals for clemency. Odebrecht has admitted to U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors that it paid $10.5 million in bribes in Mexico. Details of the payments have not been made public, though in August, Brazilian and Mexican media reported that Lozoya had asked Odebrecht executives for bribes in 2012 in return for contracts, citing testimony from Odebrecht employees.  On Monday this week, Attorney General Raul Cervantes stood down, telling Senators his office had concluded investigations into Odebrecht. However, the details have yet to be published.

Researchers raise doubts over cause of Chilean poet Neruda's death,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - International researchers investigating the death of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda raised doubts on Friday as to whether he died of cancer 44 years ago as previously presumed, and did not rule out foul play. Neruda, known for his passionate love poems and staunch communist views, died days after a coup in September 1973 that ushered in the brutal dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Neruda s chauffeur claimed Pinochet s agents took advantage of the poet s illness to inject poison into his stomach as he lay in hospital. Neruda s body was exhumed in 2013 and previous tests have found no evidence of poison but are ongoing.  Spanish forensic specialist Aurelio Luna from the University of Murcia told journalists that his team discovered something that could possibly be a laboratory-cultivated bacteria. It will be analyzed, with results expected in six months to a year. Luna also said that tests indicated that death from prostrate cancer was not likely at the moment when Neruda died.  From analysis of the data we cannot accept that the poet had been in an imminent situation of death at the moment of entering the hospital,  he said.   We cannot confirm if the nature of Pablo Neruda s death was natural or violent,  he added. Pinochet died in 2006. Neruda s family and supporters have been divided over whether the case should be closed and his remains returned to his grave near his coastal home of Isla Negra, or whether researchers should continue carrying out tests.

Peru Congress passes bill to legalize medical marijuana,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru s conservative Congress passed a bill to legalize medical marijuana late on Thursday with a 68-5 vote in favor of allowing cannabis oil to be produced, imported and commercialized. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski had proposed the measure after police cracked down on a group of mothers making cannabis oil in a makeshift laboratory to treat their epileptic children. Regulations for producing and commercializing cannabis oil will be written in 60 days, ruling party lawmaker Alberto Belaunde said.   Thousands of patients and their family members will have hope and a better quality of life,  said Belaunde. Peru s neighbors Chile and Colombia have already legalized marijuana for medical purposes. Uruguay has fully legalized growing and selling marijuana for any use. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Venezuela Maduro warns of repeat elections in states won by opposition,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan state elections may be repeated in the five states won by the opposition if the governors-elect continue to refuse to be sworn in by a controversial pro-government legislative superbody, President Nicolas Maduro warned on Friday. His warning came in a televised speech after the government on Sunday unexpectedly won 18 of 23 states in a vote which the opposition calls fraudulent. Authorities have mandated that all elected governors participate in a ceremony before the pro-government Constituent Assembly, but the five opposition winners did not take part.     Anyone who wants to be governor will have to recognize the Constituent National Assembly; otherwise elections will be repeated in states where the Assembly is not recognized,  Maduro said at the inauguration of one of the socialist candidates in western Lara state.     The opposition says that by law, the oath must be taken before regional parliaments and not before the Constituent Assembly, but so far none of their candidates have undergone that process and formally assumed their roles.     Venezuela s opposition leaders have said they would travel abroad to denounce what they call dirty tricks by the government and outright fraud in the minerals-rich state of Bolivar. Maduro says the opposition cries fraud whenever it loses elections and that Venezuela s electoral system is the most secure in the world. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Matchmaker Merkel seeks awkward three-way embrace,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened what promised to be marathon coalition talks on Friday, hoping to bring three opposing political camps into a stable government despite signs  there would be less money to paper over differences. Merkel said she was optimistic as she entered talks between her conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, despite an assessment by her own party that the next government would have less fiscal room than expected. The outcome of the talks is keenly awaited both at home and across Europe, with many fretting that the European Union could be rudderless with the bloc s longest-serving leader too busy to grapple with crucial issues like euro zone governance reform. Highlighting the challenge, a report by Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) found that there would be only 30 billion euros free for new projects over the next four years if parties stuck to their commitment to taking on no new debts. The shortfall will make all the more difficult the tricky three-way pact, dubbed a  Jamaica  coalition because the three parties  colors - black, yellow and green - match those of the Jamaican flag, which is untried at national level. Higher EU contributions as a result of Brexit and lower central bank profits might reduce spending room by some 15 billion euros, according to calculations seen by Reuters, an obstacle to the FDP s demands for tax cuts or the Greens  hope for environmental and infrastructure spending. The talks between Merkel s conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens are styled as  exploratory , but negotiators aim to get down to details of tax and budget policy in their first full meeting together.  There will be many differences,  she said on her arrival at the Berlin talks, adding:  There is readiness on my side to think about this creatively.  Party delegations each made five-minute presentations before breaking ahead of further discussions due on Tuesday. FDP chief Christian Lindner had earlier said that no matter how good the  atmosphere and seriousness  the parties were far apart on 85 percent of the material to be discussed. After, FDP secretary-general Nicola Beer said she continued to believe there was a  50:50  chance of a Jamaica coalition resulting. Merkel, weakened by a surging far-right in last month s national election, needs to make the awkward alliance fly as her previous  grand coalition  partners - the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) - say they want to rebuild in opposition after  their worst election result in more than half a century. Merkel has been able to steer Europe through its euro zone and refugee crises in part due to her dominance at home. Now that dominance is waning - her conservatives last month had their weakest election showing since 1949.  Voters have given these parties the task of governing,  wrote newspaper Die Welt.  These possible partners should not be giving the impression that they are inching warily toward each other like strangers in a crammed lift.  An Infratest Dimap poll for ARD showed 83 percent of Germans wanted the parties to find a compromise deal. Merkel, 63, has suffered two further setbacks since the national election: the CDU was defeated in a regional election in Lower Saxony on Sunday, and the party s premier in the eastern state of Saxony resigned on Wednesday, saying younger, fresher leadership was needed to revitalize the conservatives. Should the three party groups fail to form a coalition, some in their ranks fear this could lead to public disenchantment and fuel further support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which entered parliament for the first time last month. If she cannot clinch a three-way coalition pact, Merkel could try to form a minority government, or else call fresh elections - an unprecedented scenario. Alternatively, she could try to team up again with the SPD. The Social Democrats reject that option, though senior party official Thomas Oppermann has indicated they could reconsider on one condition: Merkel steps aside. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Turkish hunger striker released for remainder of trial,"ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish teacher who has been on hunger strike for months to protest about losing his job in the government s purge since a failed coup attempt last year, has been released from jail pending her trial on terrorism-related charges. Defence lawyers said primary school teacher Semih Ozakca, 28, was released, but another detainee, literature professor Nuriye Gulmen, 35, who has also survived for seven months on water, herbal tea and sugar and salt solutions, was remanded in custody. The Ankara court released Ozakca on condition that he wears an ankle monitor. Gulmen, who has been hospitalized due to her worsening health, was ordered to remain in custody until the trial, which resumes on Nov. 17. The pair began their hunger strike before being jailed. A court ordered their detention pending trial after ruling that their protest was being conducted on behalf of an outlawed far-left group, DHKP-C. Both deny any links to the group. The teachers said their hunger strike aimed to highlight the plight of some 150,000 state employees - including academics, civil servants, judges and soldiers - suspended or sacked since the abortive coup in July 2016. Turkish authorities blame the coup attempt on U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen and his supporters. Gulen denies involvement. Human rights groups and the European Union have said President Tayyip Erdogan is using the crackdown to stifle dissent in Turkey, something he denies.

Canada's Liberals look to economy to guide them past ethics scandal,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s government has been badly shaken by a conflict-of-interest controversy about his finance minister, but the Liberal government s upcoming fiscal update offers an opportunity to reset the public focus on Canada s strong economy, political observers say. The government has been plagued all week about questions about the finance minister, Bill Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell. Some have questioned whether Morneau would be forced to resign. The focus has been a rare stumble for Trudeau s government, which marked two years in office this month and has mostly maneuvered its way out of political trouble partly because of Trudeau s personal popularity and the youthful momentum of the Liberals after 10 years of Conservative rule.  They re politically very astute in a whole bunch of areas but in issues management and parliamentary management they seem to be ham-fisted,  said Andrew Graham, professor at the school of policy studies at Queen s University. With Trudeau s strong defense of Morneau, and the finance minister likely to unveil a smaller budget deficit in Tuesday s fall fiscal update, Liberals have a temporary chance to refocus on good news.  Economic conditions are a bedrock of whether people feel good or bad about how politicians are performing, and the economy is doing very well for most people,  said Abacus Data pollster Bruce Anderson.  Morneau said on Thursday he will put his assets in a blind trust and divest stock in a publicly traded family business. That comes after weeks of backlash over tax reform that has become a major obstacle for Trudeau s government. Opposition parties from both the political left and right have seized on the ethics scandal, trying to tie Trudeau s team to what they say is an entitled Liberal Party that has previously faced corruption charges.   The opposition has changed the focus from substance to ethics, and they won t let that go that easily,  said Genevieve Tellier, a political professor at the University of Ottawa. But Tellier said Trudeau s decision to fill his cabinet with political rookies - including Morneau - rather than turning to the old Liberal guard, could limit the ability of the opposition to land many ethical punches. Moreover, Morneau is respected by markets.  I think the prime minister would be very cautious about changing his finance minister. ... (Morneau) presents a reassuring image, he doesn t scare the markets,  Tellier said. Ipsos Public Affairs pollster Darrell Bricker put it more bluntly:  They really don t have a choice but to tough it out and hope some event will transpire to distract the hyenas.  The expected budget improvement in Tuesday s fall fiscal update could also give Morneau the leeway to woo voters with more spending or debt reduction.  The way the numbers are playing out, they are in a fairly favorable fiscal position,  said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada. Morneau spokesman Dan Lauzon said the finance minister has no plans to change his strategy, and would keep focus on fiscal stimulus matters:  He is in this for the long run, and he won t let distractions get in the way.

U.S. must step up support for operation against West Africa militants: France,"PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States must step up its support for a planned African force to fight Islamist militants in West Africa or it could fail, leaving French troops to carry the burden alone, France s defense minister said on Friday. France intervened in Mali to ward off an offensive by Islamist militants that began in 2012, and 4,000 of its troops remain in the region as part of Operation Barkhane where they work alongside 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Mali. France and West African countries are pushing for the creation of a regional force known as the G5 Sahel.   Washington provides bilateral assistance, intelligence and training for regional security operations. But it is cool towards the African force and has pushed back against U.N. support for it. President Donald Trump s administration has also come under intense scrutiny over its existing operations in West Africa after an ambush in Niger in early October saw four U.S. soldiers killed by jihadists, in what experts say appears to have been an intelligence failure.  In the Sahel, France is deploying in a high-intensity environment, with tremendous support from the United States. We are immensely grateful for that support,  French Defence Minister Florence Parly said in a speech at a Washington think tank monitored in Paris.  But much more needs to be done. We can t be, and don t want to be, the praetorian (guards) of sovereign African countries. They must be made able to defeat terror on their own,  she said during a visit for meetings with her American counterpart James Mattis and White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.  I would be happy if you could help spread the word in the Beltway,  she said in a reference to the U.S. government. Still, discussion in Washington was focused more on what went wrong with the Niger operation. The deadly incident has become a political football in Washington amid criticism of Trump s handling of condolence messages to the families of the dead soldiers.  The U.S. military is investigating the incident, and the FBI said it was assisting  as it has done in the past when American citizens are killed overseas.    Hours after Parly s visit to the Pentagon, Mattis visited Capitol Hill to meet Senator John McCain, who threatened to issue a subpoena to get information about the ambush in Niger after complaining about being kept in the dark.  After their talks, Mattis acknowledged that  we can always improve on communication,  remarks echoed by McCain, the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  We have had our problems and issues. But I m proud to work with him, and I m proud of the work that he is doing,  McCain said. From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles. Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead. French aircraft evacuated the wounded, but the body of one of the dead soldiers was recovered by Nigerien soldiers only after two days. The U.S. military s Africa Command issued a statement on Friday explaining that the 800 U.S. military personnel in Niger were on a mission supporting African forces.  The U.S. military does not have an active, direct combat mission in Niger,  it said.  LONG-TERM  EXIT STRATEGY? Parly said the G5 Sahel force was meant to bolster the security capacity of Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania, which are all former French colonies.  French officials see the success of the G5 Sahel as a long-term exit strategy for Paris. For decades, France has mounted military operations in its former African colonies but in recent years it has looked to spread the cost. Until now the G5 force has only received a quarter of its estimated 423 million euro budget, according to a report by the U.N. Secretary General, who said financing the operation would  remain a significant challenge  for several years.   It will start its first operations soon. It needs support. The U.N. wants to give support. I hope everyone can become convinced that a robust U.N. assistance is necessary,  Parly said. French defense officials say they expect the first G5 patrols to begin this month and hope that will provide momentum ahead of a donor conference in December. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
At least 30 police die in clash in Egypt's Western desert: security sources,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Armed militants killed at least 30 policemen in a shootout during a raid on a suspected militant hideout in Egypt s Western desert, security sources said on Friday. A number of suspected militants were also killed and security forces are combing the area, a statement by the Interior Ministry said. Egypt is facing an Islamist insurgency concentrated in the Sinai peninsula from two main groups, including an Islamic State affiliate, that has killed hundreds of security forces since 2013. Islamist militants have launched several major attacks, most recently targeting churches in Cairo and other cities with the loss of dozens of lives. The security sources said authorities were following a lead to a hideout deep in the desert thought to house eight suspected members of Hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the capital targeting judges and police since last year. A convoy of four SUVs and one interior ministry vehicle was ambushed from higher ground by militants firing rocket-propelled grenades and detonating explosive devices, a senior source in the Giza Security Office said. The number of dead was expected to rise, two security sources said. Two security sources said eight security personnel were injured in the clashes, while another source said that four of the injured were police and four others suspected militants. Egypt accuses Hasm of being the militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this. The Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula has grown since the military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013 following mass protests against his rule. The militant group staging the insurgency pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. It is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and policemen and has started to target other areas, including Egypt s Christian Copts.

"In Kirkuk, Kurds' joy turns to fear after Iraqi army takeover","KIRKUK, Iraq (Reuters) - Turkmen and Arab shoppers stroll through an open-air food market in an ethnically mixed area of Kirkuk, haggling over the price of tomatoes and gossiping about their neighbors.  Ostensibly, it s a normal day in the city of 1 million in northern Iraq. But nearby stand Iraqi Army soldiers, sent by the central government in Baghdad this week to wrest control of the city from Kurds after their vote for independence on Sept. 25. The army s recapture of oil-producing Kirkuk province and other territory across northern Iraq has dismayed the city s Kurds but brought comfort to residents from other ethnic groups.  Of course things are better now that the Iraqis have taken back the city,  said Mohammad, a Turkmen butcher grinning over a large pile of ground meat.  We re all brothers, but at the end of the day, Kirkuk is not for the Kurds. It s for Iraq.   An Arab couple who have seen Kirkuk change hands several times before said they now feel safer and more comfortable.  This is our city after all,  said the elderly Hajji Ahmed. Across the street in a Kurdish-owned restaurant, the mood is different.  None of my Kurdish regulars want to come to eat here anymore, they don t feel safe,  said the owner, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.  We re all afraid because our fate in the city is unknown.  Thousands of people fled Kirkuk after rumors of looting and violence against Kurds spread on social media, though residents said many later returned. No one Reuters spoke to had witnessed or suffered any aggression.  The scenes now are a far cry from the Kurds  jubilation on the day of the independence referendum, when they danced and sang in the streets.  Though the referendum was opposed by international allies, Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Massoud Barzani was confident its outcome would give his government leverage to negotiate secession. Kirkuk is seen by many Kurds as the future capital of an independent Kurdish state. Including it in the referendum was widely seen as a unilateral move to consolidate Kurdish control. Peshmerga fighters seized Kirkuk in 2014 after Iraqi security forces fled, leaving the region s oilfields vulnerable to Islamic State militants who had swept across northern Iraq.  But any notion of consolidated Kurdish power was quashed on Monday when Kurdish forces quietly withdrew, allowing the Iraqis to retake the city and other disputed territories claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and the Kurds.  Kurdish flags used to hang from street lamps and buildings across the whole city but are now seen only in Kurdish areas. Roadside vendors now sell the flags of the Iraqi army and Shi ite paramilitary forces.  Kirkuk has been lost forever,  said a Kurdish resident of the Shorja district. Kurds in Kirkuk feel betrayed by their political leaders and humiliated by Baghdad, which forcibly displaced them from the city under late dictator Saddam Hussein. Some civilians are now deployed along the highway to the regional capital, Erbil, with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.  We brought our guns to defend against the Iraqi invaders,  said one, a retired Peshmerga fighter.  We were betrayed, even by our own political leaders. So we had to come with our weapons to fight.  The men have built berms and road blocks to slow traffic into the small town of Altun Kupri, or Perde in Kurdish.  Now we only have orders to defend. But if they try and come to Erbil, we will attack them ferociously. We have to protect our people,  Bakr Razgai, a local commander, said before clashes in the area on Friday morning.  Such bravado was hard to find in Kirkuk. In the Kurdish neighborhood of Shorja, a poster hanging in front of the main market and showing late Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani s face next to a Kurdish flag has been scribbled over.  I ve been up every night since Monday, afraid for my life,  said Abdullah, a Kurdish clothes salesman. A friend said this was because of propaganda on social media and asked him if he had seen anything bad happen. Abdullah had not.  But I m still afraid,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1

In a statement, it said Washington was concerned by reports of violent clashes around the town of Altun Kupri.  The reassertion of federal authority over disputed areas in no way changes their status   they remain disputed until their status is resolved in accordance with the Iraqi constitution,  it said.

Brazil government to rework controversial slavery decree,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s government will issue a new decree changing the country s definition of slavery following an earlier order that was widely criticized as a reversal in the fight against forced labor, a presidential aide said on Friday. In Brazil, forced labor has been defined as a form of modern-day slavery. This includes debt bondage, degrading work conditions, and long work hours that pose a risk to a worker s health or life, and violate their dignity. Human rights campaigners said a decree issued by the labor ministry on Monday changed the way slavery was defined, limiting it to a victim s freedom of movement but disregarding other abuses. The new decree, sought by Brazil s powerful farm lobby, would derail enforcement efforts that have freed 50,000 workers from slavery-like conditions since 1995, according to federal prosecutors and labor inspectors.  Responding to the criticism, President Michel Temer said on Friday the decree would be modified but not revoked.  In an interview with the Poder360 news website, Temer said the measure would be  perfected  with suggestions by prosecutors, among them the creation of a police department for slave labor crimes. A presidential aide later said the suggestions would be used to reissue a new decree.  The president instructed the labor minister to study them and see which can be incorporated in a new decree,  the spokesman said. Rights groups estimate hundreds of thousands of people work in slave-like conditions on farms, sugar cane plantations and cattle ranches across Brazil s remote and jungle areas, as well as in urban factories and construction sites. The government decree as issued would close 506 of 706 working conditions cases under investigation, which would no longer be considered slave labor, a spokesman for Brazil s federal prosecutors office said. Temer bowed to pressure from the farm lobby to modify the decree at a time when he is relying on the group s votes in Congress to block corruption charges next week. The farm lobby praised the decree for clarifying the definition of slave labor and eliminating  excesses  by inspectors. Temer told Poder360 the decree needed changing because it contained irrelevant details for defining slavery, such as the need for a soap bar holder or a ladder to a top bunk in workers  sleeping quarters.

"Britain's May wins Brexit reprieve, faces tough weeks ahead","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May won a modest reprieve in stalled Brexit talks on Friday, with European Union leaders signaling their readiness to move the negotiations forward in the coming months. But despite a more positive tone, a weakened May now faces a delicate political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain s divorce bill without stoking a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer she walk away from the talks. EU leaders said at a summit in Brussels that they would begin preparations to move into  phase two  of the Brexit negotiations in December, a step forward that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc. Yet they also made clear that May would have to move between now and the end of the year on settling a financial bill that EU officials have estimated at around 60 billion euros.  I think it is very clear what additional steps need to be taken,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference at the end of the summit, saying movement on the financial settlement was crucial for progress in December. French President Emmanuel Macron was tougher, saying the two sides had not yet completed even half of the work on the financial settlement and accusing Britain of  bluffing  by using the media to suggest there could be no deal.  A lot is in the hands of Theresa May,  he said. An EU official said it took just 90 seconds for the 27 other leaders to adopt their Brexit conclusions at the end of the meeting, underlining how united they are. May has said she cannot provide a specific financial pledge until she knows the shape of the future relationship. The EU is insisting that the two sides agree on an exit bill, the rights of EU citizens in a post-Brexit world and Irish border issues before delving into future ties. Asked whether she had improved an offer of about 20 billion euros, May said she had repeated commitments she made in a speech in Italy last month, when she said the bloc would not be out of pocket when it came to its budget which runs until 2020.  What I made clear to my EU counterparts in relation to financial contributions... is that nobody need be concerned for the current budget plans ... and that we will honor the commitments that we have made during our membership,  she told a news conference before returning to Britain.  Now there has to be detailed work on those commitments... we are going through them line by line and we will continue to go through them line by line.  The final text from the EU-27 read:  The European Union ... notes that, while the UK has stated that it will honor its financial obligations taken during its membership, this has not yet been translated into a firm and concrete commitment from the UK to settle all of these obligations.  Still, the leaders held open the hope of reaching a deal at the next regular summit in December. And in a move that could save weeks of delay, they ordered EU negotiators to start preparing for what Brussels will want in a transition period. Uncertainty over the final shape of a Brexit deal has unsettled businesses on both sides of the Channel. Terry Scuoler, CEO of the British manufacturers  association (EEF), welcomed the warmer words from EU leaders, but said industry needed  more than a hint of progress . All the EU leaders worked hard to strike a positive tone at the summit after May used a dinner late on Thursday to appeal to the other 27 leaders to help her silence critics at home by offering a signal that the talks would move on. Many were upbeat and May struck up an animated and friendly conversation at the beginning of the summit with Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who are both seen in Britain as hardliners in the talks. That might be enough for May to calm immediate concerns at home after Brexit campaigners urged the British prime minister to signal her readiness to leave the EU without a deal and to rely on World Trade Organization rules. But she faces a major dilemma as she gears up for the next EU summit in December.  The next eight weeks will be the most challenging for ... Theresa May and the most consequential for Brexit,  said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group.

Canada granting asylum to U.S. border crossers at higher rates: data,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Asylum seekers who illegally crossed the U.S. border into Canada this year are obtaining refugee status at higher rates, new data shows, as authorities accept claims from people who say they feared being deported by U.S. President Donald Trump s administration. More than 15,000 people have crossed the U.S.-Canadian border illegally to claim refugee status in Canada this year. Many were in the United States legally and some interviewed by Reuters said they might have stayed were it not for an  immigration crackdown. The influx, mainly at the Quebec/New York border, prompted the military to set up a temporary tent encampment in Quebec and sparked a backlash from anti-migrant groups.   Lawyers who have handled dozens of cases said that members of refugee tribunals, who evaluate requests for asylum, have grown more sympathetic toward people who have spent time in the United States and who say they now fear immigration policies under Trump. Trump took office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions, in line with the hard-line immigration policies that were a focal point of the Republican s 2016 election campaign.  Of the 592 claims from border crossers finalized between March and September, 69 percent - or 408 in total - were accepted, according to Immigration and Refugee Board figures. An additional 92 appeals of rejected claims are pending. That 69 percent acceptance rate is higher than the acceptance rate for all refugee claims from people who came to Canada through any method last year. In a January asylum hearing whose transcript was seen by Reuters, a tribunal member told a Syrian refugee claimant and her daughter who had crossed near Lacolle, Quebec, that their explanation for not staying in the United States was  reasonable,  citing the woman s worries about the new U.S. government.  Certainly, that seems to be playing out as you have feared, and today on the news I know that President Trump has suspended the Syrian refugee program,  the member is quoted as saying.  You have provided, in my view, a reasonable explanation of your failure to claim in the U.S.  A second refugee decision reviewed by Reuters, issued in May, cites an Iraqi woman s detention in a U.S. airport and subsequent racist incidents she said she experienced at school as credible reasons for her leaving the United States.

Iranian commander issued stark warning to Iraqi Kurds over Kirkuk,"SULAIMANIA/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A senior Iranian military commander repeatedly warned Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq to withdraw from the oil city of Kirkuk or face an onslaught by Iraqi forces and allied Iranian-backed fighters, Kurdish officials briefed on the meetings said. Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards, traveled to Iraq s Kurdistan region to meet Kurdish leaders at least three times this month before the Baghdad government s lightning campaign to recapture territory across the north. The presence of Soleimani on the frontlines highlights Tehran s heavy sway over policy in Iraq, and comes as Shi ite Iran seeks to win a proxy war in the Middle East with its regional rival and U.S. ally, Sunni Saudi Arabia. Soleimani met leaders from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), one of the two main Kurdish political parties in northern Iraq, in the city of Sulaimania the day before Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered his forces to advance on Kirkuk, according to a PUK lawmaker briefed on the meeting. His message was clear: withdraw or risk losing Tehran as a strategic ally.  Abadi has all the regional powers and the West behind him and nothing will stop him from forcing you to return back to the mountains if he decides so,  the lawmaker quoted Soleimani as telling the PUK leadership.  The Iranian general evoked late Iraqi president Saddam Hussein s massive attack on a Kurdish rebellion in 1991, when almost the entire Kurdish population fled northern Iraq to the mountains, the PUK lawmaker said.  Soleimani s visit ... was to give a last-minute chance for the decision-makers not to commit a fatal mistake,  said the lawmaker, who like others interviewed in this story declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Commanders of the Iraqi Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi ite-led Iraqi central government s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied. But Iran has made no secret of its presence in Iraq.  Tehran s military help is not a secret anymore. You can find General Soleimani s pictures in Iraq everywhere,  said an official close to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.  Now, beside political issues, Kirkuk s oil is a very key element for Iran, which is an OPEC member. Control of those oil fields by Iran s enemies would be disastrous for us. Why should we let them enter the oil market?.  Kirkuk fell to Iraqi government forces on Monday. Their offensive followed a referendum last month in which the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region voted to secede from Iraq against Baghdad s wishes. Kurds have sought an independent state for almost a century, after colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and left Kurdish-populated territory split between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. But Iraq s two main Kurdish parties have been at odds over both the referendum and the approach to the crisis in Kirkuk, which the Kurds consider to be the heart of their homeland. The PUK, a close ally of Iran, accused its rival, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), of putting the Kurds at risk of military intervention and isolation by pushing hard for the vote, which won wide approval for independence. Soleimani has been allied to the PUK for years, but the referendum has drawn him even closer to Kurdish politics and expanded Iran s reach in Iraq beyond the Baghdad government. The Iranian general is no stranger to conflicts in Iraq, which fought an eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s. He has often been seen in footage from the frontlines, and Iran has long helped Baghdad to carry out its military strategy through paramilitary Shi ite militias which it funds and arms. Before the referendum, Soleimani suggested to Kurdish leaders that holding a vote on secession   which Iran feared would encourage its own Kurdish population to agitate for greater autonomy   would be risky.  The Iranians were very clear. They have been very clear that there will be conflict, that these territories will be lost,  said one prominent Iraqi Kurdish politician who met Soleimani ahead of the Sept. 25 referendum.  On Oct. 6, barely a week after the vote, Soleimani attended the funeral of PUK leader Jalal Talabani. Again, he wanted to make sure even his closest Kurdish allies understood the dangers of not withdrawing from Kirkuk, officials said. A senior Iranian diplomat in Iraq and an official in Iran close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei s office said Soleimani met with Kurdish leaders after Talibani s funeral and urged them to withdraw from Kirkuk and in exchange Tehran would protect their interests.    Soleimani met with one of Talabani s sons, Bafel, a few days after his father was buried, one of the PUK officials said.  Soleimani said Abadi should be taken very seriously. You should understand this,  the official said. An Iranian source in Iraq said Soleimani was in Kirkuk two nights before the Iraqi government offensive for  a couple of hours to give military guidance.  Iraqi intelligence sources said Tehran sent a clear signal to the PUK.   We understand from our sources on the ground that neighboring Iran played a decisive role in making the PUK chose the right course with Baghdad,  one Iraqi intelligence official told Reuters. Tensions over the referendum and Kirkuk have deepened divisions between the two main political parties in northern Iraq. The KDP accused the PUK of betraying the Kurdish cause by capitulating to Iran and striking a deal to withdraw.  The Talabani clan were behind the offensive on Kirkuk. They asked Qassem (Soleimani) for help and his troops were there on the ground,  said a source close to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government and head of the KDP.   It is becoming clear that Iran is directing the operations to destroy the KDP.  The PUK strongly denies this. Talabani s son Bafel accused the KDP of missing a zero-hour chance to avoid losing Kirkuk by failing to reach a deal over a military base which Iraqi government forces had demanded to take back.  Unfortunately we reacted too slowly. And we find ourselves where we are today,  Bafel told Reuters. Two other Kurdish political sources gave a similar account. Iran and Soleimani offered early assistance to northern Iraq s Kurds in the fight against Islamic State, a rallying point for the Kurdish community. But after the devastating loss of Kirkuk, Iraqi Kurds have been left disillusioned.  They (both PUK and KDP leaders) just make decisions on their own and play with people s lives. In the end, we pay the price,  said pensioner Abdullah Ahmed in Sulaimania.   This is a disaster for everyone. Everyone was united against Daesh (Islamic State). Now they are back just looking out for themselves.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Go-go going as Chinese women fuel Thai tourism boom,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - For decades since the Vietnam war, the scantily clad dancers in the go-go bars of Bangkok s Patpong red-light district have been the face of Thailand s tourism industry.  But last year for the first time, the country drew more women tourists than men as a surge in Chinese female visitors outweighed a longstanding distortion spurred by men drawn to the world s  sex capital . The shift is welcome news for Thai authorities, who have tried to promote the country s shopping, beaches and temples and to minimize the importance of sex tourism, which thrived after Thailand became an R&R hotspot for U.S. troops in the 1960s and 1970s. Tourism ministry figures reviewed by Reuters showed 52 percent of more than 32 million visitors last year were women. That compared to 48 percent in 2015 and only 42 percent in 2012. No earlier official data were available, but research from as far back as the 1980s shows a ratio of about 60 percent male to 40 percent female visitors.  Not as many women visited Thailand because they thought we were a cheap destination with too much vice, but now more are coming, which means our image accommodates them,  Tourism Minister Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul told Reuters. Tourism accounts for around 12 percent of Southeast Asia s second-biggest economy and is easily the fastest growing sector, particularly since a coup in 2014.  Hoping to attract more female tourists, the state s Tourism Authority of Thailand started a  Women s Journey  campaign last year, with a website and mobile application offering discounts for hotels, spas, malls, and restaurants. But the biggest factor has been tourism from China, which has reshaped the industry around the world. The number of Chinese visitors rose from nearly 12 percent of Thailand s visitors in 2012 to 27 percent last year. The number of Chinese women visiting Thailand nearly quadrupled over the same period to more than 5.3 million.   When Chinese men make a lot of money, they tend to take their wife, daughter, and mother to travel, making the ratio heavier on the female side,  said Virat Chatturaputpitak, vice president of the Association of Thai Travel Agents.  Major Chinese travel website Tuniu reported that 62 percent of its customers last year were women, Chinese media reported.  I chose to come to Thailand because it s close by, there are many flights, it s cheap to travel and easy to get a visa,  said Man Na Zhang, 24, at Bangkok s Erawan Shrine, a favorite  spot for Chinese tourists despite a deadly bombing in 2015.  Chinese female visitors, who get a tourist visa on arrival, also cited a simple tax rebate procedure on duty free goods as another drawcard as they snap up items such as cosmetics, bottled bird s nest soup, vitamins and supplements.  Many stores in Bangkok s shopping malls now accept Alipay, China s giant online payment service. A Big C supermarket near the Erawan shrine buzzes with Chinese tourists who fill their trolleys with bulk packets Tom Yum Goong flavored instant noodles, crispy seaweed and dried squid snacks.  Businesses in tourist towns have started printing menus in Chinese and getting workers to learn the language to cater to Chinese tourists, who last year made up more than those from Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Africa combined. China s recent  Golden Week  holiday brought 70 percent more Chinese visitors than last year, the tourism ministry said. For nationalities that traditionally patronized Thailand s sex industry, tourist numbers are still dominated by men - 68 percent of Japanese visitors, 58 percent of British and nearly 56 percent of American, Australian and German tourists. But even for those countries, the balance has shifted more towards female tourists. Although the sex industry is far from dead, local businesses complain fewer tourists were visiting areas such as Patpong and nearby Silom neighborhood.  There are evidently fewer tourists, especially in the low season, when sales can go from tens of thousands of baht a day to nothing,  said Somkid Sangwong, a manager of a restaurant in a Silom alley next to Patpong, surrounded by neon-lit signs for bars blasting loud music and offering raunchy live shows.  Phadet Mesild, a board member of the Tourism Association of Koh Samui, another popular spot for sex tourism, told Reuters the decline in demand had forced many venues in the island to close down.  Since 2014, Thailand s military government has occasionally raided brothels, bars, and massage parlors in an effort to clean up the country s image, but they have usually bounced back quickly.

Spain plans new elections in Catalonia to end independence bid: opposition,"MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government has secured opposition support for dissolving Catalonia s parliament and holding new elections there in January in its bid to check the regional government s push for independence. The Socialists, the main opposition, said on Friday they would back special measures to impose central rule on the region to thwart the secessionist-minded Catalan government and end a crisis that has unsettled the euro and hurt confidence in the euro zone s fourth-largest economy. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who wants opposition support to be able to present a united front in the crisis, has called an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday to pave the way for Madrid establishing central control in the region. The government would not confirm whether January elections formed a part of the package, with Rajoy saying only that the measures would be announced on Saturday. However a government spokesman saw regional elections as likely.  The logical end to this process would be new elections established within the law,  said government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo at a weekly government press conference. It will be the first time in Spain s four decades of democracy that Madrid has invoked the constitution to effectively sack a regional government and call new elections. Head of state King Felipe used a prizegiving ceremony in the northwestern region of Asturias to indicate support for the government and affirm the unity of Spain, of which he said  Catalonia is and will remain an essential part.   Spain needs to face up to an unacceptable secession attempt on its national territory, which it will resolve through its legitimate democratic institutions,  said the monarch, a ceremonial figure who sharply criticized Catalan leaders earlier this month.  Rajoy wants as broad a consensus as possible before taking the step, which has raised the prospect of more large-scale protests in Catalonia, where pro-independence groups have been able to bring more than one million people out onto the streets. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, a former journalist who is spearheading the secession campaign, has refused to renounce independence, citing an overwhelming vote in favor of secession  at a referendum on Oct.1. Regional authorities said around 90 percent voted for independence though only 43 percent of voters participated. Opponents of secession mostly stayed home. Spanish courts have ruled the referendum unconstitutional, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed. The prolonged standoff has caused hundreds of companies to move their headquarters outside Catalonia and prompted the Spanish government to cut its economic growth forecast. The region accounts for a fifth of Spain s economy. In a test of investor appetite for Spanish stocks, housebuilder Aedas (AEDAS.MC) dropped over 6 percent in its debut on the Madrid stock exchange on Friday, although it later regained losses to trade close to its listing price. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the region has rattled the euro. On Thursday, European Union leaders including Germany s Angela Merkel and France s Emmanuel Macron offered their support for Rajoy at an EU leaders summit in Brussels. After Rajoy announces the direct control measures on Saturday, Spain s upper house will have to approve them in a session which could take place on Oct. 27, a Senate spokeswoman said. Actions could range from dismissing the Catalan parliament and government, to a softer approach of removing specific heads of department. Direct rule from Madrid would be temporary while regional elections are held to form a new government. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
France gets serious over sexual harassment after Weinstein scandal: minister,"PARIS (Reuters) - The Harvey Weinstein scandal is forcing a rethink of attitudes toward sexual harassment in France, a country that cherishes its self-image as the land of seduction and romance, said the minister tasked with cracking down on violence against women. Movie producer Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including three who said they were raped. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. More than 300,000 accounts of sexual harassment or abuse have been published under the French #balancetonporc or #squealonyourpig hashtag on Twitter in the past week, though some conservatives say the new trend amounts to an attack on the French way of life in the name of U.S.-style puritanism.  We are really at a turning point, with the Weinstein affair as a trigger,  Gender Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa told Reuters on Friday in an interview. France has often debated sexual harassment over the past decade following scandals involving French politicians. Six years ago, a sex scandal forced former French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund, provoking a round of soul-searching in France about sexual abuse that goes undeclared or undetected in the upper echelons of power. A deputy of Macron s year-old Republic on the Move party (LREM), Christophe Arend, was accused by his ex-assistant and campaign manager of sexual harassment, the Franceinfo media outlet reported on Friday. The party said in a statement that Arend benefitted from a presumption of innocence until proven otherwise and that he had filed a complaint of  slanderous denunciation  against his accuser.  Any form of violence and harassment is intolerable. It is up to the justice (process) and it alone to shed light,  LREM said. Gender Equality Minister Schiappa said the Weinstein scandal could have a more durable impact in France because it had prompted women from all walks of life to denounce harassment and assault at work and in public places, not only in the corridors of power.  When it s about politicians, most people just slam politicians rather than seeing it as a wider issue,  said Schiappa, a 34-year-old blogger-turned-minister in President Emmanuel Macron s new government.  But when it s to do with cinema it has a wider impact, because ... people identify with actors and actresses,  she added, describing the wave of testimonies on social media as a  liberation . This week Schiappa kicked off nationwide consultations over a law due to be completed early next year that will include steps to fight sexual harassment on the streets as well as extend the statute of limitation for rape of minors. Not all French people approve of her plans or of the  #squealonyourpig trend on Twitter.  France is a country of men who love women  wrote pundits Berenice Levet and Guillaume Bigot in Le Figaro daily on Thursday.  It is not a country of Platonic love,  they said, warning against the import of what French conservatives have long denigrated as a killjoy  Anglo-Saxon  view of relationships between men and women. Responding to such criticism, Schioppa said:  There is some reluctance, some say we will kill the culture of the  French lover ... if we punish street harassment.   But it s the opposite. We want to preserve seduction, chivalry and  l amour   la francaise  by saying what is key is consent. Between consenting adults everything is allowed, we can seduce, talk, but if someone says  no , it s  no  and it s final,  she said. Much of the French debate focuses on plans to slap fines on harassment in the street and whether that is really feasible. Schiappa acknowledged it was hard to define, adding details would be decided through wide consultations in coming months.  For instance it s following a woman through several blocks or asking for her phone number 15 straight times,  said Schiappa, adding that she personally did not believe wolf-whistles should be characterized as sexual harassment.

"Czechs vote for new parliament, wealthy businessman seen as likely next PM","PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs voted on Friday in an election expected to hand power to businessman Andrej Babis who has won popular support by pledging to sweep aside traditional parties, boost investment and keep out refugees, but faces a criminal probe for suspected fraud. The central European country has enjoyed rapid economic growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, but opinion polls nevertheless show strong voter support for Babis's ANO movement and other protest parties. (Graphic: Czech legislative election - tmsnrt.rs/2vO4hPW) Founded and tightly controlled by the 63-year-old billionaire, ANO - which means  yes  in Czech - has won support from both right and left with promises to cut taxes, turf out corrupt politicians and bring business-style efficiency to government.  We want to form a government and show people that government can work differently to what they are used to. We would be (more) in touch with them,  Babis said after voting in the Prague suburb where he lives. Babis s support has weathered investigation into tax strategies at his empire of food, chemicals, farming and media   worth an estimated $4 billion   that he owned until moving it to a trust fund this year.  He has also been charged by police with fraud on suspicion that he hid ownership of a farm and a conference center so it could receive a 2 million euro subsidy in 2008. He denies any wrongdoing. ANO has maintained its rhetoric of opposition to the ruling system despite serving as a junior partner in the outgoing government along with Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka s center-left Social Democrats and the centrist Christian Democrats. Final surveys before a polling blackout began on Tuesday gave ANO about 25-27 percent support, at least twice that of the Social Democrats.    Previous governments kept saying what needs to be changed but did nothing,  said Jarmila, a 66-year old former teacher in Prague who refused to give her last name.  He is rational and can explain things.   Czech elections are spread over two days. Voting began on Friday at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) and will end at 2 p.m. on Saturday.   Although immigration to the Czech Republic is virtually non-existent, fear of it has played a big part in the election campaign, with most parties pledging to fight any attempts by the European Union to force the Czechs to accept refugees distributed across the bloc. The anti-immigrant mood mirrors similar trends in neighbouring countries. Parties opposed to immigration did well in Germany s election in September and in Austria s last week, and have fed scepticism toward the EU across the 28-nation bloc. Babis s swipes at Brussels have raised concern that he might lead the country into a more confrontational relationship with the EU, emulating the right-wing governments in Poland and Hungary. Babis opposes more EU integration and euro adoption, but has also spoken of the benefits of EU membership and says the Czech Republic should play a bigger role in reforming the bloc.  Analysts say the election may lead to a similar coalition to the outgoing government but led by ANO, which would mean no big change in a foreign policy. A deal with ANO s current partners, or with center-right parties, may run up against their demands that Babis personally stays out of the cabinet because of the police charges. A number of voters in Prague expressed distrust of Babis, who has been fighting allegations he had cooperated with communist-era secret police.  For me this election is about our stance on the European Union, refugees and is mainly (a chance to vote) against Mr. Babis,  said Gabriela Kijova, 23, after voting for the small Pirate Party in central Prague. President Milos Zeman said on Friday he would ask the leader of the biggest party to lead talks on a new government. He said he would allow a month for negotiations before he calls a session of the new parliament, which is the trigger for the departure of the outgoing administration.  There is an outside chance that Babis may form a minority government supported by the Communists and the far-right, anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy Party (SPD), which saw its support jump in the final opinion polls. Such a tie-up would be negative for investors and pose questions over policies toward the EU.  ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
Brazil's Temer says pension reform might not pass this year,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - President Michel Temer said on Friday that a bill overhauling Brazil s costly pension system might not clear Congress this year as planned, the first time that he has indicated that such a delay might happen. In an interview with Poder360 news website, Temer said the government had to again consult lawmakers in the government coalition, many of whom have already said they are doubtful the legislation will pass this year. The pension reform is crucial to Temer s attempts to plug Brazil s budget deficit and reduce the bloated pension system. But its provisions to increase the retirement age have made it unpopular with Brazilians. Temer put the delay down to charges in a corruption case that put his legislative agenda on hold for six months. The government is considering a watered-down version of the bill, Temer said, confirming previous statements from officials that it would be ready to settle for a bill that included at least the introduction of a minimum retirement age of 65 years for men, up from the current average age of 55. A diluted pension bill would also need to include a gradual transition to the new rules and parity between the public and private pension systems, he said. His chief of staff Eliseu Padilha, who also took part in the interview, said the government hoped a less extensive reform would still achieve 75 percent of the planned fiscal savings, assuming it included cuts to benefits for public sector employees. Temer also said the government may issue a temporary decree to extend for a few weeks the Refis program that allows companies and individuals to renegotiate delinquent tax payments.

Official candidate seen ahead in Buenos Aires Senate race: poll,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina s ruling party candidate for Senate in the key  province of Buenos Aires is 4.8 percentage points ahead of the opposition candidate, according to a poll by consultancy Management & Fit sent exclusively to Reuters on Friday. The country s mid-term congressional election will be held this Sunday, and is seen as an early indicator of the electoral power that President Mauricio Macri will have going into his 2019 re-election campaign.  Esteban Bullrich, of Macri s  Cambiemos  or  Let s Change  party, is forecast to win 35.3 percent of votes in his bid for the Senate, according to the poll. Buenos Aires province is home to a third of Argentina s population. His opponent, former President Cristina Fernandez, has 30.5 percent of voter intentions, according to the Management & Fit survey of 2,000 voters. The poll had a margin of error of 3.3 to 3.5 percentage points.  Fernandez is loved by many low-income Argentines for her generous social spending.

Lebanese court issues death sentence over 1982 Gemayel assassination,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s top court on Friday sentenced Habib Shartouni to death for the 1982 assassination of president-elect Bashir Gemayel, an event that was a turning point in Lebanon s 15-year civil war.  Shartouni, a member of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), admitted his part in the bombing in the 1980s and was tried in absentia after escaping from prison in 1990 following eight years in detention.  He was quoted in an interview in Lebanon s al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday saying the timing of the trial was political and that he had lived in Syria between 1994 and 2004. He did not reveal his present location.  Gemayel was killed less than a month after he was elected president and soon after he agreed to start discussing diplomatic ties with Israel. His assassination occurred during Israel s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, one of the bloodiest episodes in the civil war.  His death in a bombing that killed 32 other people on Sept. 14, 1982, still resonates among many Lebanese and triggered the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut s Sabra and Chatila refugee camps.  Supporters of both Shartouni and Gemayel have protested outside the court during the hearings.  Gemayel was head of the Lebanese Forces Christian militia, locked in conflict with leftist, Muslim and Palestinian factions, and his candidacy was backed by Israel.  Its invasion was aimed at driving from Lebanon the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as well as the Syrian army, which had entered in 1976 as part of a peace deal.  After his assassination, Israel entered the capital Beirut and allowed Gemayel s militia, the Lebanese Forces, to access the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camps, where their  fighters killed hundreds of civilian refugees.  Gemayel s family is still one of the most important in Lebanese politics, heading the Kataeb party that was founded by his father. The Lebanese Forces militia later became a different political party headed by one of its commanders, Samir Geagea.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Having nuclear weapons 'matter of life and death' for North Korea: agency,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Pyongyang does not plan to hold any talks with Washington about its nuclear program, a senior North Korean diplomat said on Friday, declaring that possessing nuclear weapons was a matter of life and death for North Korea, the RIA news agency reported. Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to  totally destroy  North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North s leader a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. Choe Son-hui, director-general of the North American department of North Korea s foreign ministry, told a non-proliferation conference in Moscow Washington would  have to put up  with North Korea s nuclear status, RIA reported.  This is a matter of life and death for us. The current situation deepens our understanding that we need nuclear weapons to repel a potential attack.   We will respond to fire with fire.  Pyongyang would regard any attempts to strangle the country via U.N. Security Council sanctions as an attempt  to declare war . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, addressing the same conference earlier on Friday, urged world powers to get behind a joint Russian-Chinese roadmap for settling the crisis over North Korea s weapons program.  We are convinced that its implementation will promote the lessening of military activity and tension on the Korean peninsula and the forming in Northeastern Asia of a system of equal and indivisible security,  he said.  The plan proposes a moratorium on North Korea s missile and nuclear weapons tests, while South Korea and the United States suspend holding military exercises.  The main task at the current stage is to prevent a military conflict which will inevitably lead to a large-scale humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe,  Lavrov said.  All the sides involved should exercise restraint.     ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1

Iran's Guards flex muscle in Middle East despite Trump warning,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A week after U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a blistering speech about Iran s Revolutionary Guards, the most powerful military and economic force in the Islamic Republic has shown it has no intention of curbing its activities in the Middle East. In defiance of other world powers, Trump chose in a speech last Friday not to certify that Tehran is complying with a pact to curb Iran s nuclear work and singled out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), accusing Tehran of destabilizing the region. A senior IRGC commander said after the speech Trump was  acting crazy  and was following U.S. strategy of increasing  the shadow of war in the region . Iran s Shi ite militia proxies have made formidable military gains in recent months in Syria as well as Iraq, stretching from northern Iraq to a string of smaller cities and this week, after the Trump speech, re-captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.  In the short-run clearly Trump has increased the power and aggressiveness of the IRGC,  said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University.   The IRGC can t back down from a street fight. Their domestic and regional prestige is predicated on the fact that they fight a good fight and they don t back down.  The day after Trump spoke, the head of the Guards  al Quds overseas operations, Major General Qassem Soleimani, traveled to Iraq s Kurdistan region. He held talks about the escalating crisis between Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government after a Kurdish independence referendum. The niece of the late Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, Alaa Talabani, told the al Hadath TV channel that Soleimani met with members of her family on Saturday. He had come to pay respects to Jalal, a former Iraqi president and founder of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party who died this month. Other Iraqi and Kurdish officials told Reuters Soleimani held meetings with Kurdish leaders to persuade them to retreat from Kirkuk ahead of the Iraqi army push into the city.  I don t deny that Mr. Qassem Soleimani gave us the advice to find a solution to Kirkuk,  she said.  He said Kirkuk should return to the (Iraqi) law and constitution and to have an agreement about Kirkuk and give up the intransigence about the referendum which was a decision not thought out.  Within days, Iran s mostly Shi ite allies in Baghdad launched a lightning assault, pushing Kurdish fighters out of disputed territories such as Kirkuk and consequently strengthening Iran s hand in Iraq. Commanders of the Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi ite-led Iraqi central government s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied. A video posted by the Kurdish Rudaw channel online on Wednesday showed an Iraqi Shi ite militiaman loyal to Iran hanging a picture of Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Kirkuk governorate office. Iran, which has a large Kurdish minority, has reason to be wary of Iraqi Kurdish independence. It fears it might encourage its own Kurds, who have also pushed for separatism. After the independence vote in Iraqi Kurdistan on September 25, videos posted online showed hundreds of people celebrating in the streets in the Kurdish areas of Iran. FRONT-LINE PLAYER Regional analysts say the emergence of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Kurdistan and Lebanon, where it wields influence through its allied Shi ite Lebanese Hezbollah militia, means Tehran has become a front-line player in the region which Washington could not afford to ignore.  Trump s stupidity should not distract us from America s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the (nuclear) deal, we will shred it,  said Khamenei.  Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region.    Speaking after Trump s speech, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards  aerospace division, said:  From the start of the Islamic revolution ... (presidents) have increased the shadow of war in the region ...  Dear brothers and sisters today Trump is acting crazy to gain concessions through this method.            The ramping up of tension could put the two countries on a collision course in the Gulf where clashes have only been narrowly avoided in recent months. Small boats from the Revolutionary Guards  navy veered close to U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf at least twice this year, prompting the U.S. military to fire warning shots and flares. In August, an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (31 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane, risking a crash, according to a U.S. official. Some recent naval showdowns between Iran and the United States took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass annually. During the presidential campaign last September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be  shot out of the water . The Guards could also target U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria through tens of thousands of loyal Shi ite militia fighters without directly acknowledging a role in any attacks.  The IRGC can claim ignorance of Shi ite militia attacks against the U.S. military,  said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has done extensive research on the Guards. In early October, an American soldier was killed in Iraq by an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP, a type of roadside bomb which was often used by Iran s Shi ite militia proxies in Iraq, according to the U.S. military.  This is the first time that we ve seen it used in this area,  U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesman, said. Dillon said the U.S. military has not yet concluded who carried out the attack. Dozens of American soldiers in Iraq were killed and injured by EFPs used by militia groups linked to Iran after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, according to the U.S. military. Asked about the threat posed by Shi ite militias allied with Iran in Iraq and Syria, particularly after Trump s speech, Dillon said:  We re always assessing the threats no matter where they come from. During certain announcements or certain dates or when certain events happen, we make proper adjustments.  Trump s new plan, observers say, will also weaken a group that had made progress in curbing the Guards  political and economic ambitions in recent years: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the pragmatist politicians in his cabinet. Since becoming president in 2013, Rouhani and members of his cabinet repeatedly pushed back against the Guards  economic influence and involvement in political matters. Now, Rouhani s push against the Guards has been tempered because of the hardening in Trump s approach to Tehran, regional observers said.  What this has done is that even those who were critics are now defending the Revolutionary Guards,  said Nasser Hadian-Jazy, a political science professor at Tehran University.

French defense minister: scrapping nuclear deal would be gift to Iran hardliners,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - France wants to take action to tackle Iran s missile program and  destabilizing  behavior but believes scrapping the 2015 nuclear deal would help hardliners and be a step towards future war, France s defense minister said on Friday.  We need the JCPOA. Scrapping it would be a gift to Iran s hardiners, and a first step towards future wars,  Florence Parly said in a speech at a Washington think tank, referring to the nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  But we should also be very serious about the destabilizing ballistic and regional activities. We are working on it.  Parly is the first French minister to visit the United States since President Donald Trump s refusal to certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. She held talks with her American counterpart James Mattis and White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact agreed between Iran and six world powers. That has alarmed its European allies, who fear the deal will slowly unravel.  The issue is now in Congress. France has no desire to be embroiled in U.S. domestic politics, but our position on the agreement is clear.    ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
U.S. House to vote on non-nuclear Iran sanctions next week,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote next week on new sanctions on Iran s ballistic missile program and on Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia, senior House Republicans said on Friday, seeking to take a tough line against Iran without immediately moving to undermine the international nuclear deal.  It is Congress  responsibility to work with the executive branch on a clear-eyed strategy to stop Iran s reckless behavior,  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the number two House Republican, and Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement emailed to Reuters.  Immediate action towards this goal will come from the House next week as we vote on legislation that furthers sanctions on Hezbollah and Iran s missile proliferation,  they said. President Donald Trump defied both allies and adversaries on Oct. 13 by refusing to certify that Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. That threw the fate of the agreement between Iran, the United States and other world powers into the hands of Congress, by opening a 60-day window in which Congress could reimpose, or   snap back,  sanctions on Iran s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement. However, many of Trump s fellow Republicans - who all opposed the deal reached under former Democratic President Barack Obama - have said they see no immediate need to do so. Congressional aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the missile and Hezbollah sanctions. In the Senate, a separate effort is under way to amend existing U.S. law to set new conditions for the U.S. role in the pact, although critics said such a plan could violate terms of the deal, formally known as the JCPOA. Britain, France and Germany, European U.S. allies who signed the agreement, are particularly concerned about Trump s action and have lobbied Congress to preserve the nuclear pact. Among other things, the ballistic missiles bill would toughen existing sanctions by going after entities with assets outside the United States if they were found to support Iran s ballistic missile program. It has broad bipartisan support in the House, and also is expected to pass the Senate. The Hezbollah bill is directed at the Shi ite militia s allies in Lebanon s government and asks the Trump administration to estimate and distribute assessments of the net worth of Lebanese politicians. The Senate has already unanimously passed a different version of the Hezbollah sanctions bill. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Zuma spokesman dismisses reports South African deputy president may be sacked,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Jacob Zuma s spokesman said on Friday there was no basis for reports that the South African president would axe his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, speculation about which has weighed on the currency and bonds. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, of which Zuma is leader and Ramaphosa deputy, has been riven by bitter infighting ahead of a party conference in December at which a new leader will be chosen.      It s rumors and gossip, and we don t comment on them at all,  Zuma s spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga told Reuters. Ramaphosa, a trade unionist-turned-business tycoon, is viewed as the most likely rival candidate to Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the former chairwoman of the African Union, who is Zuma s pick for the leadership and is the president s ex-wife.  He has recently stepped up criticism of Zuma s scandal-plagued government. Asked in parliament on Thursday whether he might be sacked, Ramaphosa said only that he would accept the president s decision if he lost his job. On Friday, a spokesman for the deputy president said:  We are aware of the speculation, but it is just speculation.      Trade union federation Cosatu and the South African Communist Party (SACP), both partners in the ANC s ruling alliance, have endorsed Ramaphosa, 64, for the leadership. South Africa will elect a new president in 2019, and whoever the ANC picks in December is likely to take over from 75-year-old Zuma as the country s leader. Zuma is under pressure to step down before then, with a recent South African court ruling that nearly 800 corruption charges against him should be reinstated prompting more calls for the president to go. Zuma reshuffled his cabinet for the second time in seven months on Tuesday, irking some within the ruling alliance by sacking a minister belonging to the SACP and appointing a close ally to oversee an opaque nuclear deal.  Analysts say Zuma may make further changes before December to strengthen his hand going into the ANC s elective conference. Speculation that he might remove Ramaphosa, who was the ANC s chief negotiator during the 1990s transition from apartheid, weighed on the rand and bonds, which underperformed emerging market peers on Friday versus a firmer dollar.  Other emerging markets are weaker but not as much as the rand. That s because of lingering political uncertainty, especially these rumors about Zuma axing Ramaphosa,  said currency dealer at TreasuryOne Wichard Cilliers. Ramaphosa told parliament on Thursday that  if (Zuma s) decision is to remove me, I will accept that as a decision that will be taken by the president and I will continue serving the people of South Africa in one form, shape or another . Speaking on Friday, Ramaphosa returned to the subject of corruption within the government and state-owned companies, which is expected to be a main theme of his leadership campaign.   Our state has been captured by people who ... want to milk the state, who want to rob our country of the money that belongs to the people,  Ramaphosa told members of the National Education Health & Allied Workers  Union (Nehawu) in Cape Town.     Our state is now being talked about in the rest of the world in the most negative terms, captured by certain interests, by certain families, by certain individuals.  Wealthy friends of Zuma, the Guptas, have been accused by ANC and opposition politicians of using their close relationship with the president and his allies to influence the awarding of government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing and the Indian-born South African businessmen and their companies have not been charged with any crime in South Africa.  Regulators in the United States and Britain are looking into links between the Gupta family, the South African government, and banks they may have used to move money as a corruption investigation escalates. In a statement on Friday, Dlamini-Zuma denied she had any links to the Gupta family. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Zuma given November 30 deadline ahead of South Africa decision on graft charges,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has given President Jacob Zuma until Nov. 30 to make submissions before it  decides whether to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against him before he became president, it said on Friday. The Supreme Court of Appeal last Friday upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate the charges against Zuma. They were set aside in April 2009 by the then-head of the NPA, paving the way for Zuma to run for president later that year. The ruling by the appeals court amplified calls for Zuma, 75, to step down before his term as president ends in 2019. A spokesman for Zuma was not immediately available.  Zuma has faced a series of corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest his friends the influential Gupta family may have used their influence to secure state contracts for their companies. Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing. Following last Friday s ruling, the NPA was required to make a decision on the charges, which relate to a 30 billion rand ($2 billion) government arms deal arranged in the 1990s. Zuma requested the NPA to give him a chance to make representations before deciding whether to proceed against him. On Friday, the NPA accepted that request but said any further submissions by Zuma should be on issues not previously considered by authorities. The NPA also asked anti-corruption officials to report on the availability of the witnesses in the case by Nov. 30. Mmusi Maimane, leader of the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, welcomed the NPA s action but said in a statement:  We are of the belief that Jacob Zuma is being afforded special treatment .... Any other person would be hauled before a court and charged. It was unclear how long the NPA would take to decide on whether to charge Zuma after receiving his submissions. It was also unclear what would happen to the charges if the NPA decides not to proceed.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Malawi arrests 140 in clampdown after 'vampirism' killings,"LILONGWE (Reuters) - Police in Malawi said they arrested 140 suspected members of vigilante mobs that have targeted people accused of vampirism, clamping down after a wave of attacks in which at least nine have been lynched. The mob attacks began in mid-September in four districts in southern Malawi, where belief in witchcraft is widespread. This week they spread to Blantyre, the country s second-biggest city, where mobs torched one person and stoned another to death on Wednesday.  We have so far arrested 140 people we suspect are behind the mob killings in Blantyre and other districts and the investigations are still going on,  Lexon Kachama, inspector general of Malawi Police, told reporters. Police were doing everything possible to contain the situation and ensure the violence did not spread to other cities and townships, he said. Information minister Nicholaus Dausi told Reuters that the government will put soldiers on the streets to stem the vampire rumours that have resulted in nine deaths.  We are deploying the army in townships and districts affected to help police calm down the situation and save lives,  Dausi said. President Peter Mutharika has also been visiting parts of the country affected by the violence. The United Nations and U.S. embassy have blacklisted several districts in Malawi as dangerous zones for staffers and nationals. Earlier this month the UN pulled staff out of two areas in southern Malawi. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Death of a blogger casts shadow over murky Malta,"VALLETTA (Reuters) - Daphne Caruana Galizia posted two items last Monday on her popular blog, one ridiculing Malta s opposition leader for having rounded shoulders, the other denouncing a senior government official as a  crook .  A typical morning s work done, she set off in her white Peugeot 108 to run an errand, but barely made it past her front gate before a bomb tore through the car, throwing it into an adjacent field and killing her instantly. Her death shocked Malta, the smallest nation in the European Union, which has been engulfed by a wave of graft scandals, including accusations of money laundering and influence peddling in government   all of which have been denied. Caruana Galizia exposed many of these cases and was loved by her readers as a fearless, anti-corruption crusader. Critics saw her as a muck-raking fantasist. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, her main target, promised everything would be done to find her killers, but friends and family have low expectations that anyone will be brought to justice, seeing murky powers behind a very professional hit.  She had to be done away with because she couldn t be bought off,  said Manuel Delia, a blogger who described the 53-year-old Caruana Galizia as his mentor.  She was a polemicist, a provocateur and a critic. She was unique in Malta.   A trail-blazing journalist, Caruana Galizia was one of Malta s first political columnists in the 1990s at a time when its newspapers were staid and male-dominated. The confines of established media frustrated her and in 2008 she set up her blog   Running Commentary   a one-woman operation which drew up to 400,000 page views a day, matching the volumes recorded on the websites of the largest dailies. She sometimes posted more than 30 items a day, mixing caustic commentary with tabloid gossip and detailed graft allegations, supplied by what she called her  network of spies .  The blog allowed her to express herself exactly as she wanted and expose abuse wherever she saw it,  said Petra Caruana Dingli, a friend of the slain writer. Much of the criticism was leveled against Muscat and his leftist Labour party, which won power in 2013 after a nearly quarter of a century of uninterrupted rule by the conservative Nationalist Party, itself tainted by corruption scandals. Malta, a rocky archipelago 100 km (60 miles) south of Sicily with a population of 430,000, has no major soccer clubs or religious divisions. Instead, people define themselves by their politics, and Caruana Galizia was seen in the Nationalist camp. She denied being in anyone s camp, but said Labour was turning Malta into a mafia state   something the party rejects.  She was a fierce Labour critic, but definitely not a fair critic,  said Glenn Bedingfield, a Labour parliamentarian.  She made very personal attacks over the way we looked, the way we dressed. She used to ridicule anyone associated with the Labour Party camp. She was not kind. She hurt a lot of people.  She could also shake the party to its core. Last year, in the so-called Panama Papers, she found Muscat s chief of staff and one of his ministers had Panama-registered companies. She said they created the firms to hide bribes. They denied wrongdoing. This year, she said she had proof Muscat s wife also owned a Panama-based company that allegedly received $1 million from Azerbaijan, which has growing commercial ties with Malta.  She denied the accusations, as did Muscat, who instigated an investigation. Magistrates heard evidence from Caruana Galizia, but have yet to release their findings. Muscat called snap elections for June, saying he wanted a fresh mandate to prevent political uncertainty from damaging the economy, the strongest performer in the European Union. Critics such as Caruana Galizia say the economic success is fueled by schemes such as selling Maltese passports to foreigners, or handing out licences that have turned Malta into the online gambling capital of Europe. The government says these initiatives are legitimate, and voters returned Muscat to office with a stable majority.  Stunned by his victory, Caruana Galizia halted work on her blog for a month to spend time with her three sons and take care of her much loved house and garden. She returned in the summer with a surprise new target   Adrian Delia who was looking to become leader of the Nationalist Party (NP). Some NP supporters saw it as a betrayal and vilified her in  social media.  People called her a hag, a slut, a witch,  said her friend Caruana Dingli.  It took its toll, but she carried on regardless.   Going where newspapers feared to tread, Caruana Galizia accused Delia of drawing money from a London-based prostitution racket. He denied this and filed five libel suits. Caruana Galizia received 36 libel suits in the past nine months alone, including 19 from a property developer, while the economy minister persuaded the courts to freeze her bank account to ensure she could pay up if she lost a case against him.  The libel suits were part of a wider strategy to shut her up,  said Corinne Vella, one of Caruana Galizia s three sisters.  They seemed to be designed to eat up her time and money.  Caruana Galizia came from a well-to-do family and her husband was a successful lawyer. Besides her blog, she also edited a glossy magazine and wrote newspaper columns. She was confident she would win the Malta libel suits, where, in any case, maximum damages total 11,647 euros ($13,728). Four days after her killing, police say they have made no arrests and predict it will take weeks to accumulate all the evidence.  I think people silence journalists not because of what they have written, but because of what they are planning to write,  Muscat told Reuters in his office in Valletta. Caruana Galizia s friends and family say they were not aware she had uncovered any explosive new stories.  I asked her if she had any more. She told me:  Isn t what I have got enough?  said blogger Manuel Delia. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
"Three police officers killed, eight injured in shoot-out in Giza: security sources","CAIRO (Reuters) - Three police officers were killed and eight others injured in a shoot-out during a raid on a suspected militant hideout in Giza, southwest of the Egyptian capital, two security sources said on Friday. The sources said authorities were following a lead to an apartment thought to house eight suspected members of Hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the capital targeting judges and policemen since last year. The suspected militants fled after the exchange of fire there, the sources said. Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this. An Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula has grown since the military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013 following mass protests against his rule. The militant group staging the insurgency pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. It is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and policemen and has started to target other areas, including Egypt s Christian Copts. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1

'Unacceptably high' number of Afghans flee military training in U.S.: report,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan soldiers and police brought to the United States for training go  absent without leave  at far higher rates than those of any other country, potentially imperilling efforts to assist Afghan security forces, a U.S. watchdog said on Friday. Of the 320 foreign military trainees who left while on courses in the United States from 2005 to 2017, 152 - or more than 47 percent - were Afghans, said a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). The State Department called that number  unacceptably high . SIGAR found that the rate of asylum seekers among Afghan military trainees rose in recent years as violence in the Islamist Taliban insurgency spread across Afghanistan and security forces sustained heavy casualties. In 2016, for example, the percentage of Afghan trainees who went AWOL (absent without leave) jumped from an historical average of about 6 or 7 percent to 13 percent, the report noted. That s compared to an average of about .07 percent of trainees from other countries, according to SIGAR.  The tendency of Afghan trainees in the United States to go AWOL may hinder the operational readiness of their home units, negatively impact the morale of fellow trainees and home units, and pose security risks to the United States,  it concluded. Only 27 of the Afghans who left their training have been arrested or removed by U.S. police, SIGAR said, with most of the other 83 either unaccounted for or having fled the United States.  Many of the Afghans who seek asylum in the United States say their lives would be in danger if they returned home. Although Afghan trainees are considered  high risk  because of their military training and  fighting age,  SIGAR said it was   not aware of any acts of terrorism or similarly serious acts  involving them. In response to the high number of Afghans who go AWOL, the U.S. government has reduced the number of training courses it offers, and Afghan commanders are also more reluctant to allow their troops to attend. That has disappointed some members of the Afghan security forces who told SIGAR they are paying a price because of their colleagues who run away.  If a student absconds, it affects his unit,  one Afghan officer told investigators. Between 2005 and 2017 the U.S. military brought more than 2,500 Afghan soldiers and police to the United States for training, including programs that trained pilots for the nascent Afghan Air Force and special forces, according to SIGAR.

Eyes on Odinga as Kenya election board CEO takes leave before vote,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s opposition leader Raila Odinga, who says he will boycott a presidential election re-run due next week, said on Friday he would announce a  way forward  the day before the scheduled poll, raising the possibility he might participate after all. At a memorial in western Kenya for opposition supporters killed in protests against the vote set for Oct. 26, Odinga told his supporters not to attack  innocent people  including people who support his rival President Uhuru Kenyatta. He did not comment on an announcement by the electoral board chief executive Ezra Chiloba earlier on Friday that he would take three weeks  leave. Kenya is holding the re-run after the Supreme Court threw out the result of an Aug. 8 election won by the incumbent Kenyatta but disputed by the challenger Odinga. The opposition leader has refused to participate in the re-run, arguing that reforms were needed first to prevent fraud. The opposition has demanded Chiloba resign, and the announcement that he will not participate in running the vote suggests progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations involving Western diplomats and religious and civil society leaders. Uncertainty over whether Odinga will participate in the election and concerns that it may not proceed peacefully have left Kenya, a traditionally stable Western ally in an often chaotic region, mired in political crisis. The volatile build-up to the Oct. 26 vote has revived memories for Kenyans of ethnically charged violence that killed around 1,200 people after a disputed election in 2007, when Odinga also lost and disputed the result. Chiloba told Reuters that, in light of the opposition s demands, he was going on leave, and that all arrangements for next week s vote were in place. At least 45 people died nationwide in a police crackdown on opposition supporters after the August vote, including a six-month old baby struck on the head by a police baton. With Odinga yet to respond to Chiloba s decision to go on leave, diplomats said they were unsure what would happen next.  The crystal ball is very cloudy at the moment,  a senior western diplomat in Nairobi told Reuters.  The situation is changing by the hour.  The electoral board has said next week s election will go ahead. Odinga met its chairman Wafula Chebukati on Thursday and later told reporters that if there were serious consultations and serious reforms, the opposition could review its boycott. Chebukati had said a day earlier that he could not guarantee the election would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against colleagues. A fellow board member resigned this week after fleeing to the United States, saying she feared for her life. The opposition has held near-daily protests demanding electoral reforms and the sacking of board officials. Police said on Friday four people were killed as a result of their interventions to stop demonstrations.  Kenyatta has meanwhile urged Kenyans to come out in large numbers to vote, insisting the ballot be held. On Thursday, he snubbed an invitation to meet Chebukati, saying he would instead spend the time campaigning. In a speech in Nairobi on Friday, Kenyatta said the election must not divide the nation or push it to the brink. Disruptions of the vote by  those who thrive in chaos and relish anarchy  would not be tolerated, and security forces  have been enhanced and appropriately deployed to maintain law and order , he said.

"Raqqa to be part of 'federal Syria', U.S.-backed militia says","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Raqqa will be part of a decentralized federal Syria now the city has been freed from Islamic State, the U.S.-backed militias that captured it said on Friday, tying its political future to Kurdish-led autonomy plans for northern Syria. The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the people of the majority Arab city and surrounding province would decide their own future  within the framework of a decentralized, federal, democratic Syria . In a declaration formally announcing Raqqa s liberation from Islamic State after four months of battles, the SDF pledged  to protect the frontiers of the province against all external threats , and to hand control to a civil council from the city. The U.S.-backed SDF, which is led by Kurdish militia fighters and also includes Arabs, captured the Syrian de-facto capital of Islamic State s self-proclaimed caliphate this week in a decisive defeat for the group that had ruled over millions of people from central Syria to northern Iraq. In Syria, the fight against Islamic State has taken place amid a wider, multi-sided civil war between the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Iran and Russia, and an array of rebel groups supported by other powers. Kurdish-led authorities in other parts of the north say they want a federal system that would allow regions to rule themselves without central control by the center. They have been moving ahead with plans set it up, despite discouragement from their U.S. allies and strong opposition from both Turkey and the Syrian government in Damascus.  Turkey views the rise of Kurdish power in Syria as a threat to its national security, viewing Kurdish groups in northern Syria as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK), which is fighting a three-decade insurgency in Turkey. Turkey said on Friday that a huge banner of jailed PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan unfurled in central Raqqa by the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces was proof that Washington had been working with terrorists. The Kurdish-led autonomy plans in Syria have advanced as diplomacy has failed to make any progress towards a political solution to the six-year-long war. Assad, who is fast regaining territory in Syria s most populous eastern regions with Iranian and Russian military support, has repeatedly said the state will recover all Syria. Asked about the SDF statement, Ali Haidar, the Syrian government minister responsible for national reconciliation, said Raqqa s future could only be discussed  as part of the final political structure of the Syrian state . The SDF, dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, has established control over swathes of northern Syria in operations backed by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, mostly avoiding conflict with Russian-backed pro-government forces. Spokesman Talal Silo reaffirmed the SDF s plan to hand control of Raqqa to a civil council formed of people from the city, and to hand over internal security to a police force drawn from local recruits. He called Raqqa s liberation  the final chapter  of a struggle that began against Islamic State from the town of Kobani some three years ago, though the SDF is still fighting the jihadist group in Deir al-Zor province. The United States has said it will take the lead in helping to clear rubble and restore basic services to the city. With Islamic State s self-declared  caliphate  crumbling in its last remaining Syrian strongholds, Assad s Russian allies said on Thursday the fight with the jihadist group would soon be over. President Vladimir Putin expressed hope a new peace conference could be convened, though the Kremlin said on Friday it was too early to discuss the timing or venue for the proposed  congress of the peoples of Syria .

France's Macron says Raqqa fall not end of battle against Islamic State,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that France s military would continue its fight against lslamic State in Syria, but that the fall of the militant group s bastion in Raqqa needed to lead to an inclusive political system to restore stability.  The battle against Islamic State did not end with the fall of Raqqa and France will maintain its military effort as long as necessary,  Macron s office said in a statement.  The challenges of stabilization and reconstruction will not be less than those of the military campaign.  In a declaration formally announcing Raqqa s liberation from Islamic State after four months of battles, the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Friday that Raqqa would be part of a decentralized federal Syria.  France has supplied weapons to the SDF, has special forces operating in the region and has been one of core countries bombing militants as part of the U.S.-led coalition. The statement also said it was vital that governance in Raqqa respected all communities.  This principle should apply first and foremost to the city of Raqqa, under conditions that will enable the restoration of normal living conditions, the return of the displaced and refugee populations, and the sustainable return of peace and stability,  the statement said.  The fight against Islamic State has taken place amid a wider, multi-sided civil war between the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Iran and Russia, and an array of rebel groups supported by other powers.  Syria must finally find a way out of the civil war, which has fueled terrorism since the suppression of the democratic movement by the Bashar al-Assad regime. A negotiated political transition is more necessary than ever,  the statement said. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Turkey says Kurdish militant banner in Raqqa shows U.S. sided with terrorists,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey said on Friday that a huge banner of jailed Kurdish militant leader Abdullah Ocalan unfurled in central Raqqa by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces would further harm already fraught relations between Ankara and Washington. The banner of Ocalan was raised on Thursday at a ceremony to mark Raqqa s capture from Islamic State in a campaign spearheaded by Kurdish Syrian YPG fighters, with military support from the United States. Turkey considers the YPG to be an extension of Ocalan s Kurdistan Worker s Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey s southeast and is designated a terrorist organization by the United States, European Union and Turkey. Ankara says that weapons supplied to fighters in Syria have ended up in PKK hands, threatening Turkish security.  I wonder what more evidence the U.S. needs to accept that the ... YPG is a terrorist organization,  Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters as he left a mosque in Istanbul.  Displaying a photograph of the PKK terrorist leader damages U.S.-Turkey relations very seriously. With this move, the U.S. is not only cooperating with terrorists, but they are endangering the future of Syria.  The banner of Ocalan was raised on Thursday by an all-female Kurdish militia. Kurdish YPG commanders and fighters were also shown chanting  Long Live Apo! , as Ocalan is known by his followers, in a video of celebrations distributed by the YPG press office. President Tayyip Erdogan echoed Yildirim s condemnation.     How can the U.S. explain the poster of Ocalan in Raqqa? Is this the way they are cooperating with us in the struggle against terror?  he said.  You are not standing by us against terrorism. You wouldn t allow this if you were.  Ocalan has been in jail in Turkey since 1999 on a treason conviction. He negotiated a truce from his prison cell, but the ceasefire broke down two years ago and thousands have died in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey in renewed violence since then. The banner incident comes amid a diplomatic spat between Ankara and Washington over the detention of a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul that has seen the two countries suspend visa services for each other s citizens.

"Turkey to allow muftis to conduct weddings, sparking uproar on left","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey s parliament approved a law to allow some state-employed religious officials to administer civil marriages, a move opposition parties view as another blow to secularism and women s rights under President Tayyip Erdogan. The law, passed late on Thursday, will allow muftis - officials employed by the state s Religious Affairs Directorate - to perform civil marriages that were previously administered only by municipal officials. The secularist main opposition Republican Peoples Party (CHP) has vowed to take the law to the Constitutional Court  as soon as possible , while the leftist pro-Kurdish Peoples  Democratic Party (HDP) has also opposed it. Critics fear the new law could lead to an increase in underage marriages, citing the religious ceremonies practiced in rural areas where brides are sometimes under 18.  This paves the way for child brides because according to Islam, there is no age limit, a girl who has reached puberty can get married,  CHP Deputy Chairman Ozgur Ozel told Reuters.  Ozel said the law included  constitutional breaches  and disregarded the founding values of the constitutionally secular Turkish republic. Civil marriage under the age of 18 is illegal in Turkey, although in rural parts of the Sunni Muslim nation of 80 million religious ceremonies are common. HDP lawmaker Huda Kaya said the law was a  slightly formalized  version of a previous controversial proposal that critics said could allow men accused of sexually abusing girls to avoid punishment if they marry their victims. The proposal was retracted from parliament last year after a public uproar.  They say this is against secularism. The church does this in the West,  Erdogan said last week. Erdogan, whose roots are in political Islam, and his ruling AK Party say the law is designed to speed up the officiating of weddings, normally carried out by mayors at municipal offices. But one CHP lawmaker, Ali Seker, said each state official had on average fewer than one wedding to conduct per day last year, citing official statistics during a debate in parliament. The law states that the offices of muftis will be given the right to carry out weddings, meaning the religious officials could also appoint Muslim clerics or imams to officiate civil weddings - an authority that has never been granted to non-state employees in modern Turkey.  This is the act of legalising a social event that is part of Turkey s traditions. The spirit of the laws must be in harmony with the spirit of social life,  Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said. Erdogan has spent his political career fighting to bring religion back into public life in Turkey and has cast himself as the liberator of millions of pious Turks whose rights and welfare were neglected under the secular elite. Liberal Turks see Erdogan as attempting to roll back the work of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the Western-facing founder of modern Turkey.  This is a clear alternative to secularism. Even bringing this bill on the agenda is igniting a spark against secularism,  said Canan Gullu, chairwoman of the Turkish Women s Associations Federation, told Reuters.  No matter what they do, women s fight will continue, and democracy and secularism will survive.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Russian aerobatics team joins Serbian display of air power,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Russia s elite aerobatic team zoomed over Serbia s military airport on Friday as Belgrade exhibited its newest fighter jets in a display demonstrating close ties between the fellow Slavic, Orthodox Christian countries. Serbia has sought to balance ambitions to join the European Union with continued warm relations to Russia, which backed Belgrade s ultimately failed effort to prevent its ex-province of Kosovo from seceding and declaring independence. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu attended Friday s air show, staged to commemorate the liberation of Belgrade from Nazi Germany by the Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav Communist partisans in 1944. Five of six MiG-29s donated to Serbia by Russia in 2016 - Serbia now has 10 MiGs in all, dating to 1987 - were painted in new grey camouflage and parked on the runway of Batajnica military base just outside Belgrade for the occasion.  Dear Mr Shoigu, thank you for these wonderful presents, thanks to the people of Russia and President (Vladimir) Putin,  Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told Shoigu in Russian.  I hope our cooperation will be even better.  Russia s aerobatic team, the Swifts, demonstrated their flying skills while Serbian jets and air mobile infantry carried out a mock air security operation and assault on ground targets. Serbia has joined NATO s Partnership for Peace program but  is not pursuing membership of the alliance, which remains deeply unpopular among Serbs because of its 1999 air war to stop then-nationalist President Slobodan Milosevic s campaign to crush Kosovo s uprising by killing and expelling ethnic Albanians.  Last year, Belgrade signed a deal with Airbus  to buy nine H145M light helicopters with weapon pods to be used by both military and police. But Serbia, which in 2014 opened accession talks with the EU, remains attached to friendship with Russia, an ally that, for example, blocked independent Kosovo from becoming a member of the United Nations, at Belgrade s request.

Deadly Somalia blast reveals flaws in intelligence efforts,"NAIROBI/MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The size and methods of the latest truck bombing in Mogadishu show how international and Somali government efforts to stop the killings are failing, partly because intelligence gathering to counter such attacks is so disjointed, security sources say.   More than 300 people were killed in the bombing in the heart of the capital on Saturday, the deadliest attack in the history of the Horn of Africa nation. The Islamist insurgency al Shabaab was blamed for the blasts, which happened when a car bomb and a truck bomb headed for the airport detonated prematurely.   Somali security services and the donor nations working with them are both to blame for disorganization in the divisions that are supposed to be working to detect and stop such attacks, said Hussein Moalim Mohamud Sheikh Ali, a former national security adviser to the president.   The national security architecture is in tatters,  he told Reuters.  The Shabaab attacks are a symptom of the greater political dysfunction of the state.   The increasing frequency and growing size of the attacks threaten the fragile security gains made in Somalia ahead of the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers at the end of the year. They also are a concern for other countries in the region where al Shabaab is active, such as Kenya and Uganda. In 2016, 723 people died in 395 attacks in Somalia, up from 46 dead in 36 attacks in 2010, according to a confidential report produced earlier this year by Nairobi-based thinktank Sahan Research.  Initial swab tests at the site of the attack showed traces of potassium nitrate, a fertilizer component, indicating al Shabaab is now manufacturing explosives as well as buying them or harvesting them from munitions, experts say. Competing programs funded by different donor nations and the lack of a centralized database are hurting efforts to analyze intelligence related to improvised explosive devices (IEDs), four Western and one Somali security source told Reuters.  A letter from Somalia s minister of internal security addressed to the United States, Britain and the United Nations in May complained of competition and secrecy among agencies gathering intelligence.    Multiple actors involved means this process is highly disorganized ... causing a severe problem for the governmental counter-terrorism efforts,  said the letter, seen by Reuters.  The pressure is building on President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who must ensure Somalia s fledgling security forces are ready to step in when the 22,000-strong AU force leaves. His government is already stalling on releasing a report into a joint U.S.-Somali raid on Bariire in August that residents say killed 10 civilians. Political disagreements threaten co-operation between Somalia s federal and regional forces.  Last week the minister of defense and army chief resigned, without giving reasons. The interior ministry spokesman resigned this week.  Somali police did not respond to requests for comment. HIGH-GRADE EXPLOSIVES Obtaining high-grade military explosives - the material that makes a bomb explode - involves harvesting them from captured munitions, or buying them from someone else.  Making their own explosive allows the insurgents to build more and bigger bombs, according to the Sahan report and an upcoming report from a U.N. panel of experts that monitors an arms embargo on Somalia. According to the U.N. report which is due to be published next month, the U.S. Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, which is funded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has confirmed the presence of potassium nitrate in six major vehicle-borne bomb incidents since 2016.   The potential use of HME (home-made explosive) by al Shabaab would allow the group to rely less on the process of harvesting explosives from munitions, which is slow and laborious   allow(ing) the militant group to increase the frequency and explosive weight of its IEDs,  said the report.  Al Shabaab, which wants to overthrow Somalia s U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law, has not yet claimed responsibility for Saturday s attack, in keeping with previous incidents in which large numbers of civilians have been killed. Mass civilian deaths have caused deep divisions among fighters, a security source with knowledge of discussions within the group said.  A former top al Shabaab commander, Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur,  condemned the attack and was photographed by local media donating blood. Robow defected to the government in August after the U.S. government removed a $5 million bounty for his capture. Two Mogadishu-based security sources outlined the events leading up to the latest attack to Reuters. They said a car bomb and a truck bomb were deployed to hit Mogadishu International Airport, a warren of buildings ringed by barbed wire and blast walls that house contractors, diplomats and a European Union military training mission.   One bomb would have breached a checkpoint, opening the way for a larger bomb,  one of the Western security contractors told Reuters.  They also had fighters nearby ready to come inside the base.   The driver of the car bomb had been driving through checkpoints for a week ahead of the attack, paying small bribes and getting security forces used to his presence, he said.  A larger truck entered the city and passed through one checkpoint, but was stopped at one known as Kilometer Five. Panicking, he tried to force his way through, but got snarled in traffic next to a fuel truck.  I could see the truck speeding. I also heard few gunshots behind it. Police must have been chasing it,  said Mohamed Ali, 21, who was injured in the blast.   As it advanced it came to many cars in the street, then the truck driver swerved abruptly to the left lane, but its tyres got stuck in the highway divider. What followed was the blast and smoke.   The fireball tore through the intersection, incinerating hundreds of civilians. Many were too badly burned to be identified and were buried in mass graves.  The driver of the car bomb was detained at another checkpoint by soldiers who had taken him out for questioning before its bomb also detonated.  Three security sources told Reuters he identified himself as al Shabaab. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Georgian president reluctantly signs new constitution into law,"TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili on Friday reluctantly signed into law a new constitution that will do away with direct election for president and switch to a system of proportional representation in parliament. Margvelashvili, who unsuccessfully tried to veto the draft bill, said it was personally difficult for him to sign the document, but he did so in the interests of stability in the country which straddles an energy supply route to Europe and is an arena of strategic rivalry between Russia and the West.  Considering the country s internal and external challenges and the fact that we should do everything to avoid possible causes of detribalization, I am signing this document,  Margvelashvili said in a statement. Margvelashvili had originally sent the draft back to parliament with his objections which included opposing a call for an end to direct elections for president. But parliament overturned his veto. Margvelashvili, who was elected in 2013 for a five-year term, criticized the ruling Georgian Dream party for adopting the constitution without a consensus with other political forces in the ex-Soviet country.  It has been obvious since the very first day (of the constitutional reform process) that the ruling party aimed to adopt a one-party constitution,  he said. The next presidential election in Georgia is to be held in 2018 and it is not clear whether Margvelashvili, who is at odds with the ruling party on several issues, will stand again. MPs from the Georgian Dream said the constitutional reform process set a new constitutional tradition and culture in Georgia.  The amendments were introduced not to strengthen the ruling party s political positions, but ... to strengthen democracy in Georgia,  Irakli Kobakhidze, a parliamentary speaker said. The new constitution will enter into force following the next presidential election next year. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
At least 46 attacks in area of Niger where U.S. troops killed: U.N.,"NIAMEY (Reuters) - A part of southwestern Niger where four U.S. Green Berets were killed during a mission the U.S. military had considered low-risk has seen at least 46 attacks by armed groups since early last year, a U.N. agency said on Friday. The deaths of the four U.S. soldiers and ensuing confusion over what happened during the Oct. 4 ambush have thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counter-terrorism mission in the West African nation, where about 800 U.S. troops are deployed. Four Nigerien soldiers were also killed. U.S. forces do not have a direct combat role in Niger and instead provide assistance to its army, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support. Several Islamist militant groups are known to operate in the area near the border with Mali where the ambush occurred, however, and U.S. officials later said a local Islamic State affiliate was suspected of carrying it out. Following the attack near the village of Tongotongo, the U.S. military s Africa Command said the soldiers  mission to meet with local leaders was considered low-risk so there was no armed air cover.  According to non-exhaustive information gathered in the (Tahoua and Tillabery) regions, 46 attacks perpetrated by armed groups have been recorded,  a note from the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency said on Friday. Seven districts in the Tahoua and Tillabery have been under a state of emergency since March, and the government renewed the measure for an additional three months on Sept. 18. Niger s army launched a military operation to reestablish security in Tillabery in June.  The deadly incident has become a political football in Washington amid criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump s handling of condolence messages to the families of the dead soldiers. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Thursday he may consider issuing a subpoena because he said the White House has not been forthcoming with details of the ambush. From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles. Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead. French aircraft evacuated the wounded, but the body of one of the dead soldiers was recovered by Nigerien soldiers only after two days. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Thursday that the incident was under investigation and defended the military s response, even as he acknowledged that it did not yet have all the accurate information on the incident.

The weekly magazine reported that the German government had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Israel under which a declaration by the Israeli government would not be regarded as sufficient evidence that the affair was concluded.

Thousands of Somalis gather to mourn bomb victims,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Thousands of Somalis prayed in Mogadishu on Friday at a symbolic funeral for more than 300 people killed by the country s deadliest truck bombing. The truck detonated next to a fuel tanker on Saturday, creating a huge fireball that incinerated multi-story buildings. Around half the dead were burned beyond recognition, said authorities. The government conducted mass burials soon after the blast, in keeping with the Muslim practice of interring the dead as quickly as possible. Religious leader Abdi Hayi said mourners had decided to conduct a symbolic funeral six days on, as it had not been possible to give so many of the victims a proper send-off with prayers at a mosque.  Since we have not seen many bodies we came to conduct the funeral at the spot of the blast,  he said. The bomb attack was the deadliest since Islamist militant group al Shabaab began an insurgency in 2007. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility, but the al Qaeda-linked organization has increasingly used truck bombs. Somalia has been mired in conflict since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator then turned on each other. One of the poorest countries in Africa relies on foreign donors to support its institutions and basic services. The battle-scarred coastal city is on edge after the bombing. A central road in the city emptied quickly after locals suspected a minivan loaded with vegetables was carrying a bomb. As police checked the van, shopkeepers and residents fled the scene.   I closed my shop and ran away,  said shopkeeper Abdullahi Omar.  We have much fear and still the shock ... persisting in our minds.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Belgian-based businessman challenges Grace Mugabe's diamond ring claim,"HARARE (Reuters) - A Belgian-based businessman on Friday challenged Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe s accusation that he duped her of a $1.35 million diamond ring and asked her to provide the court with evidence to back her lawsuit. President Robert Mugabe s wife Grace this week sued Jamal Hamed in a Harare High Court, accusing him of failing to deliver the 100 carat jewel she said she had ordered from him for her wedding anniversary last year. Grace, 52, who is seen as a possible successor to her 93-year-old husband, said Hamed had instead provided an inferior ring worth $30,000 and when she had complained had refunded only $120,000. But Hamed filed his own court application disputing the claim and demanded that Grace should supply the court with details such as a copy of the sale agreement and proof of payment before he put in his defense. Hamed s lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said she had deposed the court papers on behalf of her client on Friday. In the court papers seen by Reuters, Hamed, a British national, said Grace should also provide proof that he in fact owned Zimbabwean companies the first lady wished to be sold to recover the money  When, exactly, is it alleged the payment was done? Full dates are required. Full details of the account holder, the account number and a copy of the account statement are required,  Hamed said in the court application. Grace s lawyer Wilson Manase did not answer his phone when contacted for comment. The court case has lifted a veil on the wealthy lifestyle of Mugabe and his wife, nicknamed  Gucci Grace  for her reputed dedication to shopping, at a time Zimbabwe is in the grip of a severe U.S. dollar crunch and cash shortages.

Irish student Ibrahim Halawa freed after four years in Egypt jail,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian authorities have released high-profile Irish detainee Ibrahim Halawa following his acquittal last month of charges including murder, in a four-year mass trial criticized by human rights groups. Halawa, a student, and three of his sisters were charged along with nearly 500 others with a host of crimes including breaking into a mosque, killing 44 people, and illegal possession of firearms in violence that followed the military s overthrow of Egypt s Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, in 2013. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Irish national broadcaster RTE on Friday that Halawa was likely to be able to fly home by Monday following his release late on Thursday.   This is a great moment for Ibrahim and his family   a moment for celebration, and a moment for savoring freedom, and I want to wish Ibrahim Halawa and his family all health and happiness for the future,  Coveney said in a separate statement. Egyptian rights activists say they have faced the worst crackdown in their history under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who was elected president in 2014, a year after as armed forces commander he led the military s toppling of Mursi. Halawa was 17 when he was arrested in 2013 with hundreds of others as part of the crackdown on protests. Since then he had been held in pre-trial detention, where he said he was regularly tortured. The defendants in the case had all faced the death penalty but none received it, though hundreds were given sometimes hefty jail sentences. Rights groups welcomed Halawa s release.  After four years of unjust detention, today Ibrahim Halawa finally walks free. He should never have been jailed in the first place and it is utterly outrageous that he was forced to spend a single minute of his young life behind bars.  said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Halawa s family for comment on Friday, but his sister Fatima told RTE in a radio interview:  It s beyond description ... It s amazing to finally know that Ibrahim is out and he s released and he s safe.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
French businesses seek clarity on Iran nuclear deal,"PARIS (Reuters) - French businesses and foreign and finance ministry officials will meet next week as they work together to understand better the consequences of U.S. President Donald Trump s refusal to certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.   Multi-nationals Total and Peugeot are among the most high profile companies to have signed new deals since the accord that provided sanctions relief for Iran and dozens of smaller French firms have also moved in or are looking to tap the Iranian market. According to an invitation sent to companies by the Medef business group, officials from the foreign ministry, finance ministry and France s business office in Tehran will offer on Tuesday an  analysis of the consequences of the non-certification  by Trump of the accord. European capitals are determined to keep alive an accord that offered Iran an economic lifeline and the Paris government wants to know how its companies might react to the U.S. move.  We re still assessing how firms are reacting to the Trump decision, but we are trying to not be overly alarmist with them,  said a French diplomatic source.   While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact agreed between Iran and six world powers. Despite a long history of commercial, political and social links with Iran that even saw Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei in exile near Paris in 1979, France took one of the hardest lines of the six powers negotiating the nuclear agreement with Iran.      Since the deal was agreed, however, France has manoeuvred to deepen economic ties with Tehran and has repeatedly said it believes Iran is fully implementing the nuclear accord.  According to a notice on the Medef website, the discussion points include an explanation on the next steps at the U.S. Congress, the position of the accord s other signatories - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - and the immediate consequences on companies already operating in Iran.

Doubts about smoking gun as Duterte lauds China role in rebel killing,"MANILA/MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was eager to credit new ally Beijing in the death of militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, saying it was a Chinese rifle that fired the bullet that finished off Islamic State s  emir  in Southeast Asia. The smoking gun that took out the region s most feared insurgent on Monday was one of the 100 sniper rifles donated by China, Duterte said, although the ranger unit conducting the operation said the shot was fired from a heavier weapon mounted on an armored vehicle. Duterte is a huge fan of the Chinese rifles and took a pot-shot himself in the direction of militants in Marawi City recently. Addressing businessmen and diplomats, he singled out ambassador Zhao Jianhua for China s support that led to the crucial killing.  I would like to officially inform you, Ambassador Zhao, that the rifle that killed Hapilon was a sniper rifle made in China,  Duterte announced late on Thursday, to warm applause from the crowd. But the version of the final hours of the life of Hapilon and another rebel leader, Omarkhayam Maute, posted on the Facebook page of a member of the Army Scout Rangers, tells a different story. The blow-by-blow account on  Scout Ranger Books , posted the day Hapilon was killed, tells of how the 8th Scout Ranger Company was engaging militants and was not aware the rebel commanders were among those they killed, until fleeing hostages told them.  The soldiers operating at night used thermal imaging on an armored vehicle and the shot that killed Hapilon came from a gun mounted on top of it, according to the account. No mention was made of Chinese weapons or snipers. Prior to Duterte s remarks, two soldiers in that vehicle told CNN Philippines the fixed weapon was remote controlled. A general in Marawi in command of the armored assets told Reuters the fixed weapons are 50-calibre machine guns. Duterte has made a big effort to befriend China and has frequently praised its leadership while in contrast, chiding defense treaty ally the United States, its biggest source of weapons and expertise, for what he calls hypocrisy and for treating his country  like a dog . Asked which gun killed Hapilon, Colonel Romeo Brawner, deputy commander of the Marawi task force, said he could not say for sure, as troops had used guns made by the United States, China and others countries.

South Koreans' support for nuclear projects deals blow to government energy plan,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean public support for nuclear power on Friday sucker punched a government policy to steer the country away from nuclear-generated electricity as Seoul said it would bow to a demand to resume construction of two new reactors.  President Moon Jae-in came to power in May, after running  on a ticket that called for reducing South Korea s nuclear and coal-fired power generation in a push to use more natural gas and renewables.  Those plans were dealt an unlooked-for blow on Friday when a public opinion survey found a majority of almost 60 percent in favour of resuming the stalled construction of two reactors.  Building the two reactors could mean reversal of a strategy to slowly reduce nuclear energy s share of the power mix, and also significantly eat into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand of the world s second-largest consumer of the fuel.   Our recommendation to the government is restarting construction,  said Kim Ji-hyung, chairman of a government-organised committee to study the nuclear projects.   Our final public opinion survey showed 59.5 percent of (responding) South Koreans chose to resume the construction,  Kim told a news conference.  Stability of power supply was cited as a primary reason for the choice in survey responses, the committee said.  We respect the will of the committee,  said South Korea s presidential office spokesman Park Soo-hyun.  An expert at a government think tank said the size of the win in favour of the projects meant the government had no choice but to go with the committee s recommendation.   The outcome was very unexpected ... Many expected the difference would be a maximum 10 percentage points, but as it turned out, it stood nearly at 20,  said Roh Dong-seok, senior research fellow at the Korea Energy Economics Institute.  The two 1,400-megawatt (MW) reactors - Shin Kori No.5 and Shin Kori No.6 - were originally to be completed by March 2021 and March 2022, respectively, in the southeastern city of Ulsan. The government announced a suspension of the projects after coming to power, saying it would consult the public over their future.  The committee conducted four rounds of surveys, including phone interviews of 20,006 people and public discussions involving some 470 citizens, over the past three months. With the reactors now likely going ahead, completion dates are set for October 2021 and October 2022, according to state-run nuclear operator Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power [KRHYDR.UL]. (For a graphic on 'South Korea 2016 power generation mix' click reut.rs/2xTOZKB)      Shares of Korea Electric Power Corp rose 0.6 percent to 41,110 won ($36.32) on Friday, after jumping nearly 6 percent following the announcement of the survey results.      KEPCO Engineering & Construction, in charge of the reactors  design, lost 1.2 percent after surging as much as 20 percent. KEPCO Plant Service & Engineering gained 1.7 percent.  Building nuclear power plants takes years, so the decision in favour of the two new reactors will not change South Korea s immediate fuel demand patterns.  But the vote, which surprised many in the industry, does impact the long-term outlook for the country s fuel consumption, with the biggest impact likely falling on imports of LNG.   Full implementation of Moon s election promises could have resulted in around 10 million tonnes (a year) of extra LNG demand by 2030. This now seems unlikely,  said Kiah Wei Giam, principal analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  That compares to South Korea s LNG imports of 33.4 million tonnes last year, according to customs data. [LNG/KRTRD] Giam said, however, the survey did not totally derail the government s energy policies.   With the planned nuclear phase-out delayed, it will be interesting to see whether more aggressive anti-coal policies are enacted,  Giam said.

U.S. will not interfere in EU trade with Iran: Tillerson,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States does not aim to impede European trade and business transactions with Iran despite President Donald Trump s decision last week to decertify the 2015 nuclear agreement, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Wall Street Journal. European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with Iran from any adverse effects should Washington reinstate sanctions against Iran, officials said.  The president s been pretty clear that it s not his intent to interfere with business deals that the Europeans may have under way with Iran,  Tillerson told the Journal in an interview Thursday.  He s said it clearly:  That s fine. You guys do what you want to do.  Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany. The Republican president gave Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for scaling down a program the West fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran denies.  Trump has criticized the nuclear accord as  the worst deal ever  and has vowed to withdraw if Congress and European allies do not address his problems with it. Tillerson s comments appeared aimed at reassuring the Europeans that Washington is not trying to pressure them into avoiding business with Iran.  We ve been working with the Europeans for six months,  Tillerson said.  They have been brought along with this same thought process. It doesn t mean that they necessarily agree entirely with it. ... Now we will start a more formalized process with them now that the policy s been adopted.  The Journal said Tillerson would not discuss the multibillion-dollar deals reached by Boeing Co (BA.N) under the 2015 accord. Boeing, which was the first major U.S. company to announce a major business venture with Iran, last year agreed to sell dozens of commercial planes to Tehran. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
EU will cut some money for Turkey as ties sour,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will cut some of the money earmarked for Turkey to join the bloc, reflecting increasingly sour ties with Ankara but stopping short of killing membership bid of the country it still sees as a strategic partner. The EU has been walking a tight rope for months on Turkey, angered by President Tayyip Erdogan s crackdown on critics after a failed coup in July, 2016, but dependant on Ankara to keep a lid on immigration to Europe and combat militants in Syria.  The EU leaders  chairman, Donald Tusk, said the bloc had agreed in two days of talks in Brussels to cut or reroute some of the 4.4 billion euros ($5.2 bln) Ankara was due to get as part of its accession talks in 2014-20.  It was a substantive discussion. We want to keep the door open to Ankara, but the current reality in Turkey is making this difficult,  Tusk told a news conference. Germany has seen its ties with Turkey particularly strained and Chancellor Angela Merkel called last month for a tougher stance on Ankara as she campaigned for re-election at home.

"South Sudan commander on trial for rape, murder of aid workers found dead","JUBA (Reuters) - A South Sudanese army commander on trial for his role in an attack on aid workers has been found dead in military custody, an army spokesman said on Friday. The attack by soldiers at the Terrain Hotel in the capital Juba was one of the worst on aid workers since South Sudan plunged into civil war in 2013.  The rape of five foreigners and murder of their local colleague occurred on July 11, 2016 as President Salva Kiir s troops won a three-day battle in Juba over opposition forces loyal to ex-Vice President Riek Machar.  Lt. Col. Luka Akechak was found dead last weekend, army spokesman Santo Domic Chol told Reuters on Friday. Chol said Akechak had fallen sick  some weeks ago  and received medical treatment in Juba but did not recover.  The military custody told us that the man was found dead in the morning.  Akechak was the unit commander at the hotel on the day of the attack and is one of more than a dozen South Sudanese soldiers standing trial in a military court.  The army spokesman said that in the last hearing, one of the rape survivors who testified said she witnessed Akechak directing the soldiers to raid property at the hotel.   The next hearing in the trial is scheduled for Wednesday.  Lawyer Philip Manyang, who is representing survivors of the attack in court, told Reuters that survivors would be testifying by video conference in a closed session. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
"Baghdad must show restraint, respect Kurdish rights, France says","PARIS (Reuters) - France on Friday called on Iraq s central government to show restraint after taking control of the last district in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk and said Baghdad should take the rights of Kurds fully into account.  Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants. [L8N1MV1K2]  We ask the federal government to show restraint and fully respect the rights of the Kurds,  foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne told reporters.  Tens of thousands of Kurds have fled Kirkuk and Tuz to the two main cities of the Kurdish autonomous region, Erbil and Sulaimaniya, according to Kurdish officials. The United Nations expressed concern on Thursday at reports of forced displacement and destruction of Kurdish homes and businesses, mainly in Tuz. Romatet-Espagne said the Kurds also needed to accept a dialogue with Baghdad within the framework of the constitution.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Merkel says Britain must move on Brexit bill to break deadlock,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that the European Union could only agree to enter the next phase of Brexit negotiations in December if Britain provided specific assurances about its readiness to settle financial obligations to the bloc. Speaking to reporters at the end of a two-day EU summit in Brussels, Merkel said it was  very clear  what British Prime Minister Theresa May had to do to break a deadlock in the talks that has prevented a discussion about Britain s post-Brexit relationship with the bloc, known as  phase two .   We hope that by December we have moved along enough to allow phase two to begin but that depends on the extent to which Great Britain makes progress so that we can say that it is sufficient on the core themes of phase one,  Merkel told a news conference at the end of an EU summit. She said that the main obstacle was Britain s failure so far to signal a readiness to settle financial obligations to the bloc that EU officials estimate at around 60 billion euros. May, under severe domestic pressure after a botched election in June that saw her Conservatives lose their majority, has said that Britain will stand by its financial commitments to the EU without offering figures.  I think it is very clear what additional steps need to be taken,  Merkel said. Asked about suggestions from May that Britain could pursue a two-year transitional deal once it leaves the bloc in 2019 in order to buy time to clinch a more comprehensive agreement, Merkel said this was not the primary focus for now.       The two-year transition phase is an interesting idea, no question. But it is not part of phase one of the negotiations,  she said.  So it is there in the room and will be discussed at the proper time.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1

"Austrian coalition talks set to begin, far right likely partner","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s president gave the green light to conservative leader Sebastian Kurz on Friday to form a government, but Kurz gave little away about his coalition plans, leaving a tie-up with the far right the most likely outcome. Kurz s People s Party (OVP) secured 31.5 percent of the vote in Sunday s parliamentary election, winning by a clear margin but falling well short of the majority needed to control parliament in the affluent Alpine republic.  I would like to build a government that has the courage and determination to bring real change to Austria,  Kurz, 31, told reporters after meeting President Alexander Van der Bellen, who will oversee the process. Kurz campaigned on a platform that combined a hard line on immigration similar to that of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) with traditional conservative principles like slimming down the state and cutting taxes. He said he would start by holding talks with all parties in parliament although only two of them, the Social Democrats (SPO) and FPO, have enough seats to give him a majority if they go into coalition with the OVP.  I will now get straight to work and hold the first discussions, definitely in the coming days, and possibly even today,  Kurz said, adding that after those initial discussions he might launch formal coalition talks with one party. Kurz went to Brussels on Thursday to assure European Union leaders of his support, allaying concerns that Austria country would become a dissonant voice in the EU with the anti-immigrant far right likely to enter its government. It became clear after neighboring Germany s election last month that it was headed towards a three-way  Jamaica  coalition - so called because the parties  colors match that country s flag. Austria s political future could be colorful too.  Using the same principle and some creative licence, Austria s next government could be dubbed  Botswana  or  Islamic State . Two other options,  Haiti  and  Albania , appear to be off the table, at least for the time being. In Austria as in Germany, each party is traditionally associated with a color - black for Kurz s OVP, red for the centre-left SPO and blue for the far-right FPO.  Botswana (black and blue) remains the most likely option, given that Kurz and the head of the Social Democrats, outgoing Chancellor Christian Kern, have often clashed and Kurz called an end to their coalition, forcing Sunday s snap election. Kurz has said he would prefer to form a stable coalition but not ruled out a minority, monochrome government (Islamic State). He has accused his rivals of holding talks on an SPO-FPO,  red-blue  coalition (Haiti). But FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache poured cold water on the idea of a  coalition of losers  in an interview with tabloid Oesterreich. Asked if Kern had been voted out as chancellor, Strache said:  In my opinion, yes.  He added that people had voted for change and Kurz had a mandate to try and form a government.   If he were to invite us (to hold coalition talks), we would accept the invitation,  he said, adding that in such a case the FPO would not hold parallel talks with the SPO. Strache hosted Kurz at his home for dinner this week, their first one-on-one meeting, he said.      The chances of a red-blue alliance are  a thousandth of a thousandth , Kern told reporters at an EU summit in Brussels, but he added that his party was still open to talks. A black-red coalition (Albania) has not been completely ruled out. Kurz has hinted at being prepared to consider it if Kern is replaced as leader by Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil. Strache also focused his criticism on Kern rather than the SPO as a whole. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1

India says ready for stronger U.S. ties after Tillerson endorsement,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India stood ready to further strengthen ties with the United States, the government said on Friday, after U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson vowed to dramatically expand cooperation as a way to counter China s influence in Asia.  Tillerson, who is visiting India next week as part of a tour to the region, said in a speech the United States had begun to discuss alternatives to Chinese infrastructure financing in Asia that critics say has spawned resentment and fears of a debt trap. He also called for expanding the scope of security cooperation between India, the United States and Japan to include other countries such as Australia, a plan that China has said in the past would be de-stabilising to the region. An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said Tillerson had made an important speech on the future of India-U.S. relations and India looked forward to detailed discussions next week.  We appreciate his positive evaluation of the relationship and share his optimism about its future directions,  the spokesman said. Tillerson did not say what he meant by creating an alternative to Chinese infrastructure financing, which India has also been increasingly concerned about as China seeks to build trade and transport links in Asia. India was the only major country in Asia not to send a representative to a  Belt and Road Initiative  summit in Beijing in May because an economic corridor that China was building in Pakistan ran through territory claimed by India.  India warned that China s plans for a modern-day  Silk Road   could create an  unsustainable debt burden  for countries. The ministry spokesman said India agreed with Tillerson s call for a  rules-based  international order that is seen as under risk from China s assertive posture in Asia. The United States has repeatedly criticized China for disregarding international law with the construction and militarization of artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea, where neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have claims.  Tillerson has made a significant policy statement on India-U.S. relations and its future. He brought out its various strengths and highlighted our shared commitment to a rule-based international order,  the Indian spokesman said. India, though, has been wary of U.S. calls for a bigger Indian military role including joint patrols in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific, worried it would antagonise China further.

Germany says hopes to resume training of Kurdish fighters in Northern Iraq,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany hopes to resume its mission training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq on Sunday, provided the conflict between the Kurds and the Iraqi government does not worsen, a German defense ministry spokesman said on Friday. Germany suspended its training assistance last week citing the increased tensions between Baghdad and the Kurds after the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq voted in a non-binding referendum for independence. Germany, along with other Western nations, joined Baghdad and Iraq s neighbors in opposing the referendum, partly due to concerns that it would distract from the fight against Islamic State militants, in which the Kurds have played a key role.  If there is no serious changes on the ground, it s highly probable that the training will resume on Sunday,  the German defense ministry spokesman said. The spokesman said Germany took the decision to resume the training after consultations with the Kurdish and Iraqi parties and with the United States.  He was speaking on the day when Iraqi forces completed their push to take back control of the contested province of Kirkuk from the Kurds, who had moved into the area in 2014 to prevent Islamic State seizing the oilfields.       Germany has provided 32,000 assault rifle and machine guns, as well as other weapons valued at around 90 million euros since  2014. About 150 German soldiers are providing training to the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters for their combat against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1

Pakistan militant group finds likely replacement after U.S. drone kills leader,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Senior militant commander Asad Afridi has emerged as the favorite to become the new leader of a deadly Pakistani Taliban faction, militant sources said on Friday, days after a U.S. drone strike killed the group s chief. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, has killed hundreds of people in bomb attacks and is considered one of the most dangerous militant groups in the nuclear-armed South Asian nation. The killing of JuA chief Omar Khalid Khorasani was a major boost for Pakistan s anti-militancy campaign and is likely to help ease tension with uneasy ally the United States days ahead of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Two JuA commanders told Reuters Afridi was nominated to take over during a meeting in Afghanistan by the group s shura, or leadership council.  Asad Afridi was close to Omar Khalid, who had declared him his deputy,  said one JuA commander. A second JuA militant, who is a member of the shura, confirmed Afridi was nominated as the new chief.  Khorasani was seen as ruling the group with an iron fist.  Our organization used to be a one-man show. All powers were in the hands of Omar Khalid Khorasani,  the second commander said. Khorasani was killed during a series of U.S. drone attacks this week in which at least 30 people were killed on the Afghan side of the border. His killing follows a slight thaw in relations between Islamabad and Washington, seemingly sparked by the Pakistan army last week freeing a U.S.-Canadian couple and their three children after five years in captivity. The family was held by the Haqqani network, an Afghan Taliban-allied militant group. Warmer words from Washington have been in stark contrast to threats by U.S. officials that it would cut military aid and impose targeted sanctions if Pakistan did not stop providing a safe havens to the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network. Pakistan denies offering sanctuary to Afghan Taliban fighters and has asked the United States to target Pakistani Taliban militants who cross the porous border and hide in Afghanistan. Pakistan is investing more than $500 million to fence the 2,500-km frontier. But in a sign that relations between the United States and Pakistan are still difficult, the chief of the CIA said on Thursday the U.S.-Canadian couple had been held inside Pakistan for five years, contradicting Pakistan s assertion they were held in Afghanistan. It is not clear if Afridi would change tack if he were to be confirmed as JuA leader, but there are concerns within the group about his power base among the ethnic Pashtun tribes who live along the Afghan border. Afridi is from the Zakha Khel area of Pakistan s Khyber region but Khorasani, and most JuA fighters, are from the Mohmand region to the north.  The organization was basically formed in Mohmand and the majority of the fighters and commanders are from Mohmand therefore people would have wished someone from the same area,  said the first JuA commander. He said Afridi did not have a religious or formal school education but had a history of fighting and had at one point fought U.S. troops in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban. On Friday, a suspected U.S. drone strike killed 12 people in Afghanistan s Paktia province, according to a government official. It was the fourth day this week that drone strikes were reported on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.  Twelve dead bodies have been pulled out of the area where the missiles struck,   Laik Khan, an Afghan government official, told Reuters. The JuA has emerged as the most deadly Pakistani Taliban faction over the past two years. At one point, it allied itself with Islamic State before apparently re-joining the Pakistani Taliban. The group bombed an Easter Sunday gathering at a park in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore last year, killing at least 70 people. In August 2016, it bombed a hospital in Quetta targeting the city s most prominent lawyers, killing 74 people. In June this year, JuA targeted the provincial police chief of the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing 13 people. The attack was also claimed by Islamic State.

"Germany to cut pension contributions, free up 1.3 billion euros: sources","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany plans to reduce the combined pension contributions it takes from employers and employees by a total of 1.3 billion euros in 2018 due to record-high employment and a rising level of reserves, government sources said on Friday. The contributions for 2018 that both employers and employees pay into the public pension system will be lowered by 0.1 percentage points to 18.6 percent of the total wage package, government officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity. That means employers and employees, who roughly share the contribution, will have about 1.3 billion euros more next year, the government officials said. The exact figures will be agreed after the government has published its updated tax revenue estimates due on Nov. 9, the officials said. The cabinet could then formally agree the reduction on Nov. 22. According to calculations thus far, pension contributions were meant to remain stable at 18.7 percent until 2021 and then rise to 18.9 percent in 2022 due to Germany s rapidly ageing society. Despite a recent rise in the birth rate and the arrival of more than a million migrants, experts estimate the working age population, whose pension contributions support the growing number of retirees, will shrink massively in the next decade. Employers in Europe s biggest economy often complain about the high level of pension contributions and regularly urge the government to lower the level. A survey of Germany s DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce showed on Thursday that companies view rising labor costs as one of the principle risks for future growth.

Toxic firecracker haze darkens Indian capital after festival of lights,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Air pollution in New Delhi hit 18 times the healthy limit on Friday under a thick, toxic haze after a night of fireworks to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali - despite a court-ordered ban on their sales. Residents of the sprawling Indian capital, which already ranks among the world s most polluted cities, complained of eyes watering and aggravated coughs as levels of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that reaches deep into the lungs, rose alarmingly. Air quality usually worsens in New Delhi ahead of Diwali, the festival of lights, and the Supreme Court temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers, aiming to lessen the risk to health. But many still lit fireworks across the capital late into the night, either using old stocks or buying them from neighboring states.  Some environment activists said the court order was poorly enforced and firecrackers were still available to celebrate one of north India s biggest festivals.  Breathe nitrate and ammonia, home grown, hand made!  said environmentalist Vimlendu Jha in a Twitter post calling for city authorities to declare a public emergency. An index of air quality had crossed the  hazardous  limit of 300 on Friday, the most severe level on a U.S. embassy scale of measurement which rates a reading of 50 as good and anything above that as a cause for concern.  Some parts of Delhi such as Mandir Marg showed an air quality reading of 941, close enough to the maximum level of 999 beyond which no readings are available. The index measures concentrations of PM 2.5, PM 10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide among other indicators.  A hazardous level is an alert in which everyone may experience ill effects and are advised to stay indoors. Apart from the firecracker ban, the Supreme Court also ordered diesel generators and a power plant to be shut down to try to reduce the pollution. The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority also ordered some brick kilns to close and a halt to the burning of rubbish. Dipankar Saha, a scientist at the government s Central Pollution Control Board, said the still weather had also played a part in the toxic haze hanging over the city. But pollution levels were better than at last year s Diwali when crop burning in nearby states and firecrackers combined.   It was going to be hard to beat last year s level in any case,  he said.

Netanyahu lobbies world powers to stem Iraqi Kurd setbacks,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is lobbying world powers to prevent further setbacks to Iraqi Kurds as they lose ground to Baghdad s army, Israeli officials say. Israel has been the only major power to endorse statehood for the Kurds, partly, say analysts, because it sees the ethnic group - whose population is split among Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran - as a buffer against shared adversaries. Iraqi armed forces retook the oil-rich Kirkuk region this week, following a Sept. 25 referendum on Kurdish independence that was rejected by Baghdad, delivering a blow to the Kurds  statehood quest.      Israeli officials said Netanyahu raised the Iraqi Kurds  plight in phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week and with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.  It has also come up in his contacts with France and the Israeli national security adviser, Meir Ben-Shabbat, has been discussing the matter with Trump administration officials in Washington this week, the officials said. A Netanyahu government official, who declined to be named, given the sensitivity of Israel-Kurdish ties, suggested Israel had security interests in Kurdistan, given its proximity to Israel s enemies in Tehran and Damascus.  This (territory) is a foothold. It s a strategic place,  the official said without providing further detail. He said Israel wanted to see Iraqi Kurds provided with the means to protect themselves, adding:   It would be best if someone gave them weaponry, and whatever else, which we cannot give, obviously.      Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with Kurds since the 1960s, in the absence of open ties between their autonomous region in northern Iraq and Israel.  Netanyahu s recent lobbying has focused on Kurdish ambitions in Iraq, where the central Baghdad government has grown closer to Israel s foe Iran.            The issue at present is ... to prevent an attack on the Kurds, extermination of the Kurds and any harm to them, their autonomy and region, something that Turkey and Iran and internal Shi ite and other powers in Iraq and part of the Iraqi government want,  Netanyahu s intelligence minister, Israel Katz, told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM on Friday.   It was not clear to what extent Netanyahu s outreach may have been solicited by the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, which shies away from public engagement with Israel, worried about further alienating Arab neighbours.    The United Nations has voiced concern at reports that civilians, mainly Kurds, were being driven out of parts of northern Iraq retaken by Iraqi forces and their houses and businesses looted and destroyed.  The prime minister is certainly engaging the United States, Russia, Germany and France to stop the Kurds from being harmed,  Katz said.   Another Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, framed Netanyahu s efforts as a moral imperative.   They (Kurds) are a deeply pro-Western people who deserve support,  he said.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Ugandan opposition leader held on murder charge after protests,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda s main opposition leader was arrested and charged with murder, police said on Friday, after they broke up a rally organized to protest moves to extend President Yoweri Museveni s rule. Kizza Besigye, who has contested and lost four elections against long-time leader Museveni, was detained on Thursday. Police blamed Besigye for the deaths of two protesters during Wednesday s rally, in which officers fired bullets and teargas during clashes with government opponents.  Besigye and his colleagues led these youths who stoned police and caused deaths,  police spokesman Denis Namuwoza told Reuters. Wednesday s clash in Rukungiri near the Rwandan border was one of several violent anti-Museveni protests that have spread across Uganda since the president last week for the first time openly expressed support for proposed legislation aimed at allowing him to stay in power. In office for more than three decades, 73-year-old Museveni would be barred from running again in the next election in 2021 by a law that caps the age of presidential candidates at 75.  The proposed legislation would remove that age ceiling.  Besigye, Museveni s former physician during the guerrilla struggle that brought him to power in 1986, has claimed the four elections the pair contested were all rigged - something Museveni has denied. The president has been a staunch western ally widely seen as an anchor of stability in East Africa s often volatile Great Lakes region.  He has deployed troops in Somalia to help fight Islamist group al Shabaab, earnings plaudits from his western backers.   HEAVY-HANDED TACTICS  Besigye was arrested near the Rwandan border on Thursday, along with two other senior officials of his opposition Forum for Democratic Change (FDC).  Police spokesman Namuwoza said they had been charged with murder, assault, inciting violence and unlawful assembly, and transferred to a prison near the capital Kampala.  There was no immediate reaction to the arrests from Uganda s opposition. The proposed new law is widely seen by critics as paving the way for Museveni to rule for life. Similar moves in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi have spurred unrest. Civil society organizations accused of helping rally support against extending Museveni s rule have had their premises raided, offices searched and equipment confiscated.

Head of Germany's FDP offers Macron 'bittersweet' euro zone deal,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A leading candidate to be Germany s next finance minister signaled his willingness on Thursday to seek a compromise with Emmanuel Macron over the French President s plans for deeper euro zone integration. Christian Lindner, who leads the Free Democrats (FDP) party negotiating to be part of Chancellor Angela Merkel s next coalition government, said European policy was one of the most important topics in the talks. Lindner said Macron   who last month called for a joint euro zone budget and joint finance minister among other reforms   had described political progress as a question of finding a balance between carrots and sticks.  Let s take him literally (on this) on the European question,  Lindner said at a book launch.   That means if he wants to get something, he ll have to accept other things - for example an insolvency mechanism for states or for example the binding participation of private investors in any debt restructuring if it should be necessary,  he said.  This would be the bitter thing he would have to swallow to get something sweet - namely additional funds for investments,  Lindner said. Veteran outgoing Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, wary of anything that might leave German taxpayers shouldering common euro zone debts, has been generally lukewarm about Macron s reform plans. Lindner may succeed him under the three-way coalition that Merkel is trying to form after her conservatives lost support in a federal election last month. It has been widely speculated that the FDP would demand the top finance post as a price for joining in, though Lindner on Thursday stopped short of claiming the ministry for his party. Earlier this week, he had insisted that Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) should relinquish it. Lindner has repeatedly criticized Schaeuble, a fiscal hawk, as being too soft on Greece and putting loyalty to Merkel ahead of his own political convictions. Asked which characteristics the next German finance minister should have, Lindner said:  Being consistent.  ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1

Former Nazi death camp guard charged with accessory to murder,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German public prosecutors have charged a 96-year-old former guard at a Nazi death camp with having been an accessory to murder, as Germany races against time to bring elderly suspects from the Hitler era to trial before they die. The then 22-year-old man, whom the Frankfurt prosecutor s office did not identify in its statement, is accused of having guarded prisoners at the death camp in Lublin-Majdanek who were slated to be killed in 1943 and 1944.  According to the evidence available, the accused knew about the cruelty of the organized mass killings, just like all other members of the SS at the camp,  it said in a statement.  He also knew that these people, facing their fate innocently and defenselessly, were killed for inhuman reasons based on race,  it added. Tens of thousands of Jews and other victims were killed at the Majdanek camp near Lublin, in modern-day Poland. The suspect played a role in the  Erntefest  (Harvest Festival) executions on Nov. 3, 1943, in which at least 17,000 deported Jewish prisoners were shot dead after having dug their own graves, the prosecutor s statement said.  By being part of a chain of guards and a tower guard, he made a contribution to (the Erntefest) and knowingly and willingly supported the malicious and cruel acts.  The prosecutor s charges are based on an investigation by the Central Office for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes and on historical documents found as part of the investigation. Germany has faced criticism for not prosecuting those who were small cogs in the Nazi machine and did not actively take part in the killing of six million Jews during the Holocaust. That criticism has abated following many recent trials and convictions, including the 2011 conviction of Sobibor extermination camp guard John Demjanjuk, which gave prosecutors new legal means to investigate suspects under accessory-to- murder charges. Former Auschwitz guard Reinhold Hanning and Oskar Groening, known as the  bookkeeper of Auschwitz , have also been convicted of complicity in mass murder in recent years. But cases against a former radio operator and a former paramedic at the Auschwitz death camp were dropped as the elderly defendants were found to be unfit to stand trial.

"With tears and song, China welcomes Xi as great, wise leader","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese officials on Thursday heaped praise on President Xi Jinping s political ideology, unveiled a day earlier at a key Communist Party Congress, a sign that it could be enshrined in the party s constitution and further cement his power. Some ruling Communist Party officials were moved on Thursday to song, dance and tears in adulation of Xi, a day after he opened the twice-a-decade conclave pledging to build a prosperous  modern socialist country  for a  new era .  Three outgoing members of the elite seven-man Politburo Standing Committee that Xi heads lauded  Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era , according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Such statements indicate that Xi could cement his power with his new eponymous slogan being incorporated into the party s constitution. Whether the theory is included bearing his name will be a key measure of his status, analysts have said. No other leader has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office since Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China.  Xi is poised to begin a second five-year term next week. Party officials hailed Xi as a wise and great  lingxiu , or leader, a reverent honorific bestowed on only two others: Mao and his short-lived successor Hua Guofeng - another sign that Xi has accumulated more power than his immediate predecessors and could revive a party chairmanship as a precursor to staying on in some capacity beyond the end of his second term in 2022.  Xi Jinping... has obtained the heartfelt love and respect of the entire party, army and people, he deserves to be called wise leader,  Beijing party secretary Cai Qi, a Xi ally and one-time colleague, said on Wednesday at a meeting of the city delegation, according to the official Beijing Daily. Officials lavishing praise on the party s top leader at a congress is not unusual, but overt displays of emotion or personal adulation are rare. One female delegate from the southern province of Jiangxi broke into song to praise Xi s treatment of ethnic minorities, while another from Guangdong province said that, listening to Xi s speech, her eyes had brimmed with tears.  I feel that the reason for my country s accomplishments is fundamentally the helmsmanship of Xi Jinping,  said Jing Junhai, Beijing s deputy party chief, invoking a phase often used to describe Mao. The 64-year-old Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, tightening controls on civil society, revamping the military and asserting China s rising might on the global stage. Some party officials painted Xi as a saviour.  Because of the Party Central Committee with comrade Xi Jinping as its core, in five years, the party has been saved, the army has been saved, the country has been saved,  Liu Shiyu, head of China s securities regulator, said on Thursday. Others were more restrained. Hu Chunhua, party chief in Guangdong province and a potential contender for a spot on the new Politburo Standing Committee to be revealed next week, simply referred to Xi as general secretary and did not mention his theory during an open session on Thursday, in contrast with more than a dozen other delegates who spoke. State media reported that he had praised Xi s theory the day before. For an interactive graphic on China s economic report card, click tmsnrt.rs/2kT7Xuv The exact meaning of Xi s new banner term is not yet clear, although it is not unusual for Communist Party leaders to announce lofty slogans and then fill in the details as they go. An ideology named after Xi to guide China and the party would further consolidate his power, said Ryan Manuel, a Chinese politics expert at the University of Hong Kong.  This is a good umbrella for him to just keep saying whatever he wants and the system having to respond and study it,  he said. Xi s immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have had their ideological concepts enshrined in the constitution, but not their names. The party gave Xi the title of  core  leader a year ago, a strengthening of his position ahead of the congress, adding to speculation that Xi could retain power beyond a customary second term and even revive Mao s chairman title.

Iranian military chief visits frontline near Aleppo,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran s military chief of staff visited a frontline position near the Syrian city of Aleppo, a military news outlet run by the Lebanese group Hezbollah reported on Friday, during a visit that has underlined Tehran s deep military role in Syria. General Mohammad Baqeri visited the position with a number of Iranian officers, according to the report, which was  accompanied by photos showing Baqeri looking at a map and peering through binoculars. Neighboring Israel has expressed deep concern over Iran s role in Syria, where Iranian fighters and Iran-backed groups such as Hezbollah have played a major role fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad. Baqeri met Assad on Thursday during a visit to set out a joint military strategy, Syrian state media reported.  Baqeri has warned Israel against breaching Syrian airspace and territory and pledged to increase cooperation with Syria s military to fight both Israel and Sunni jihadist militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Iran is strengthening its foothold in Syria, warning that Israel would  do whatever it takes  to protect its security. Helped by Russian air power, Iran-backed groups including Hezbollah played a major part in the Syrian government campaign to recapture eastern districts of Aleppo city from Syrian rebels last year.

Ending Iran nuclear deal would worsen North Korea situation: Kerry,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump risks driving Iran towards nuclear proliferation and worsening a standoff with North Korea if Washington ends a nuclear deal with Tehran, former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said late on Thursday. Kerry, who negotiated the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, was speaking a week after Trump refused to certify that Tehran was in compliance with it, amid growing tensions with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  If you want to negotiate with (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, and your goal is to avoid war and try to be able to have a diplomatic resolution, the worst thing you can do is first threaten to destroy his country in the United Nations,  Kerry said. He was speaking in a private lecture delivered at Geneva s Graduate Institute.  And secondly, screw around with the deal that has already been made because the message is, don t make a deal with the United States, they won t keep their word,  he said. The nuclear deal places Iran under tough restraints, including inspections, round-the-clock surveillance and tracking every ounce of uranium produced, Kerry said.  We would notice an uptick in their enrichment, like that,  he said, snapping his fingers.  And nobody that I know of with common sense can understand what the virtue is in accelerating a confrontation with the possibility that they might decide they want to break out and make it (a nuclear bomb) now instead of 10 or 15 or 25 years from now.  Kerry, a former Senator who headed the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Swiss media that Trump s leaving the Iranian deal s fate to Congress was  very dangerous  and opened the door to  party politics . Congress cannot unilaterally renegotiate a multilateral accord, the Geneva daily Le Temps quoted him as saying.  It is possible that Congress would make an unreasonable decision that would put Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a very complicated political situation that could force him to retaliate. It s a slippery slope.   Khamenei said on Wednesday that Tehran would stick to its accord as long as the other signatories respected it, but would  shred  the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported. If Iran violated the accord, U.N. sanctions would snap back into place, Kerry told the audience.  Moreover, at that point in time folks, we have a year of break-up. We have all the time that we need in the world to be able to bomb their facilities into submission.  Ending the deal could lead to Iran hiding fissile production facilities  deep in a mountain where we have no insight .  So the scenario that Trump opens up by saying  let s get rid of the deal  is actually proliferation, far more damaging and dangerous,  Kerry said. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
China summons British official over Hong Kong remarks,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has summoned a British official in Beijing and lodged  stern representations  about recent comments from London expressing concern about a British rights activist being denied entry to Hong Kong, it said on Friday. Ben Rogers, a co-founder of Britain s ruling Conservative Party s Human Rights Commission, has been a vocal critic of Chinese-ruled Hong Kong s treatment of human rights activists, including that of jailed student protest leader Joshua Wong. He was denied entry to Hong Kong on Oct. 11. Britain said on Tuesday it had summoned the Chinese ambassador to express its concern. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated that Hong Kong is part of China, and the central government handles Hong Kong s foreign affairs and Beijing and Hong Kong decide who to let in or not as a matter of Chinese sovereignty.  China has already summoned in an official from the British Embassy in Beijing, and lodged stern representations about Britain s recent series of wrong remarks and actions on this issue,  Lu told a daily news briefing.   I must to stress here that Hong Kong matters are purely an internal affair of China s. China will not permit any government, organization or individual to interfere in China s internal affairs in any way.  Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, is governed under a  one country, two systems  formula that promises it a higher degree of autonomy and freedom than on the mainland. Last week, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said London needed an explanation from Hong Kong and Beijing about  the treatment of Rogers. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1

"New Zealand election result stokes housing, migration fears","SYDNEY/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Temporary workers and foreign students previously drawn to New Zealand on the promise of gaining residency will start leaving en masse, migration agents say, as the incoming coalition government promises to cut record migration. The tie-up between the traditionally center-left Labour Party and nationalist New Zealand First represents an abrupt shift in the formerly open door policy that fueled strong economic growth but has also been blamed for soaring house prices and growing inequality.  We are told (foreign) students are working as many hours as possible to make as much quick money as possible on the understanding there is no more path to residency, and they will need to return home,  said Connor Brady, immigration adviser and manager director at agency New Life Global. New Zealand had almost 122,000 international students in 2016, up 40 percent from three years earlier, led by China and India.  New Zealand has developed a particularly close economic relationship with China, signing the OECD s first free-trade deal with Beijing in 2008 and welcoming record Chinese investment and immigration in recent years. But Prime Minister-elect Jacinda Ardern and her coalition partner Winston Peters have found common ground in  fortress New Zealand  type policies that align more with the populist movements across Europe and the United States than Labour s free market predecessors and the outgoing National Party government.    While the coalition government is still being formed and policy detail worked out, the 37-year-old leader made clear she intends to stick with a promised reduction in migration and restrictions on foreign ownership of houses. Labour is planning to cut net immigration by up to 30,000 from the current level of just over 70,000 a year. It also plans to renegotiate certain trade deals to accommodate for a planned ban on foreign ownership of existing homes. There may also be changes to the treatment of large foreign purchases, part of a Chinese-led investment spree that has helped propel the country during a period of otherwise subdued global growth.  It s almost 2020 and you want to take us back to 1980,   Marcus Beveridge, principal at immigration and foreign investment-focused Queen City Law said of the proposals. The Sept. 23 election thrust the country into political limbo for almost a month with neither National or Labour winning enough seats to form a majority. Holding the balance of power, NZ First formed a coalition with Labour on Thursday, while the Greens have offered  confidence and supply . Labour and NZ First campaigned on similar housing policy platforms that included banning foreign investors buying New Zealand homes, introducing measures to dissuade people from quickly buying and selling properties, and increasing housing stock. Jane Lu, head of Australia and New Zealand for international property portal Juwai.com, said there would likely be a rush of foreign property investment to beat any new rules. A similar trend emerged in Vancouver and Sydney when new taxes and restrictions were about to be introduced.  They could cause buyers to front-load activity they already plan for next year,  said Lu.  One premium buyer in Sydney closed his transaction 15 minutes to midnight before the new regime kicked in.  New Zealand s housing crunch has pushed prices up more than 50 percent nationally in the last decade and in Auckland they have almost doubled, placing housing affordable at the center of the recent election campaign. It s unclear what the immediate impact on house prices will be, as there has already been a pullback in foreign investment in New Zealand property from its frothy highs.  At this stage what we know is that the new government has indicated that they will ban foreign purchase of existing houses. Whether there are further restrictions beyond that, there is a lot of uncertainty,  said Christina Leung, principal economist at the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research.  But I would say that at the moment, it s more the uncertainty itself over what new protectionist measures will be put in place which would weigh on demand for housing.  The election result caps a remarkable rise for Ardern, who only took over the party s top job in August with polls then predicting a resounding victory for the Nationals.  And while the sweeping policy changes are yet to be introduced, the New Zealand dollar has already reacted, with the Kiwi dropping to five month lows on Friday. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Attack on workers at key Pakistan port for Chinese project; 26 hurt,"QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Unidentified men threw a grenade into a laborers  hostel in the Pakistani port of Gwadar wounding 26 of them, police said on Friday, in an attack likely to raise concern about security for the Pakistani section of China s  Belt and Road  initiative. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, one of three on Thursday in the gas-rich southwestern province of Baluchistan, a key section of the plan for energy and transport links connecting western China with the Middle East and Europe.  They laborers were having dinner at the hostel when motorcyclists attacked them with a grenade,  police official Imam Bakhsh told Reuters. Separatist rebels in Baluchistan, fighting against what they see as the unfair exploitation of the province s resources, have for years attacked energy and infrastructure projects, including the Gwadar deep-sea port on the Arabian Sea. Islamist militants also operate in Baluchistan, which shares borders with both Afghanistan and Iran. Security officials have said that militants trying to disrupt construction of the Chinese economic corridor through Pakistan have killed more than 50 Pakistani workers since 2014. Pakistan has assured China that it can provide security for the $57 billion worth of projects that it plans. In the other attacks, a grenade attack at a food court in the town of Mastung, 55 km (35 miles) from the provincial capital of Quetta, wounded 15 people, a police official said.  In the third attack, gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire at paramilitary soldiers killing one and wounding four in the west of the province. On Wednesday, a suicide car-bomber rammed a police bus in Quetta killing five policemen and two passers-by. The Pakistani Taliban claimed that attack.

Turkey orders arrest of 110 people over Gulen links: media,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish authorities issued arrest warrants for 110 people from a seized company over alleged links to the U.S.-based cleric who Ankara says orchestrated last year s attempted coup, Dogan news agency and other media said on Friday. It said the police operation to seize the suspects, who were managers, partners and employees of the publishing group Kaynak Holding and related companies, was focused on Istanbul but spread across 24 provinces. Kaynak Holding was seized by the state in 2015 over links to the movement of Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. He has denied involvement in the July 2016 abortive putsch. Hundreds of firms like Kaynak, many of them smaller provincial businesses, were seized by authorities in a post-coup crackdown and are now run by government-appointed administrators. Under the crackdown, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to Gulen, while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military, public and private sectors. In a separate operation centered in Ankara, 38 former employees from schools owned by the Gulen network were arrested on Friday, according to Turkish media. The schools were closed by a decree after the failed coup. The government dismisses rights groups  concerns about the crackdown, saying only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by Gulen s network, which it says infiltrated institutions such as the judiciary, army and schools.

"South Korea stresses safety of Pyeongchang Olympics to diplomats, companies","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea s foreign ministry stressed the Pyeongchang Olympics will be safe from North Korean provocations in a briefing to diplomats and executives at foreign companies in the country on Friday, as concerns persist over tensions with the North. Officials and executives from around 120 embassies and companies in South Korea were hosted by the ministry to explain the government s efforts for a safe Olympic Games scheduled for Feb. 9-25 next year, officials told Reuters.  We will consider it our top priority to ensure the safety and security of each and every national team, the Olympic family, and all the spectators visiting Pyeongchang during the Games,  said Park Enna, a foreign ministry official, in opening remarks at the meeting.  (We) will thoroughly prepare the Pyeongchang Olympics so that it may be regarded as the safest Olympics in history.  Briefing topics included current events regarding North Korea and the Korean peninsula as well as preparations in general for the Pyeongchang Olympics, she added. Officials from the United States, Japan, Russia and China, as well as members of chambers of commerce for Japan, China and Europe were to attend, according to the ministry. An official at the Japanese chamber of commerce in South Korea told Reuters ahead of the meeting they were not specifically aware which companies were planning to attend as the ministry appears to have contacted businesses separately. Park said the UN Olympic Truce Resolution, which has been adopted every two years since 1993 to cease all conflicts during the period of the Truce, will be adopted at the UN General Assembly on Nov. 13 for the Pyeongchang Games. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have risen in recent months as North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump exchanged threats and insults over the North s nuclear and missile development program. Concerns over safety grew in tandem as the Games will take place just 80 km (50 miles) from the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, the world s most-heavily armed border.  France s Sports Minister Laura Flessel said last month that if the crisis in the region deepened and athletes  security could not be guaranteed then they would not travel to the Games. Members of France s Winter Olympics team, however, have remained optimistic the country will not boycott. Park said governments reportedly hesitant on participating in the Games have stated their position to partake in and support the coming Olympics. Rattled by rising tensions with North Korea, South Korea has been taking extra measures to try to ensure the safety of the 2018 Winter Games, including setting up a crack cyber defense team and doubling the number of troops, according to officials and documents reviewed by Reuters. North and South Korea remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict with a truce and not a peace treaty. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
"NZ Prime Minister-elect Ardern focuses on final touches in coalition deal, NZ dollar sinks","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister-elect Jacinda Ardern said she would spend Friday ironing out issues and ministerial posts with coalition partner New Zealand First, a day after becoming the Pacific nation s youngest leader in recent times. The previous night s highly anticipated announcement by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters that he would support 37-year-old Ardern s Labour Party had ended a decade of center-right National rule and spelt big changes for the country s economy. The New Zealand dollar - the world s 11th-most traded currency - fell to five-month lows as investors grappled with heightened uncertainty and a more protectionist agenda.   When you are a hands off government, when you simply allow markets to decide the fate of your people, then that does not serve a country or it s people well,  Ardern told reporters in Wellington.  You will see a proactive government by Labour.  Labour has released the names of the people who would be in the cabinet, saying it would announce their portfolios next week.  The include Grant Robertson, Labour s spokesman for finance, and David Parker, spokesman for trade.  Ardern said on Thursday she had offered the role of deputy prime minister to Peters, who on Thursday gave his backing to Labour after inconclusive Sept.23 elections, and he was considering it. On Thursday evening, Labour said it would also stick to its promises to change the central bank s mandate and seek to renegotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deals.  Concerns about a more protectionist agenda weighed on the currency and stock markets on Friday.  The New Zealand dollar fell to five month-lows of $0.6971 against the U.S. dollar, after posting its biggest daily fall in more than a year on Thursday.   The sentiment has now shifted toward more protectionist measures,  said Christina Leung, economist at New Zealand Institute of Economic Research.  Generally, financial markets don t like change, there is uncertainty over what this all means ... in the meantime that is reducing demand for New Zealand assets, and that s why we are seeing the decline in the New Zealand dollar.  The stock market was down 1.1 percent at the Friday open, but later recouped losses to stand in positive territory. Ardern told radio earlier that most of the party s flagship policies, including a ban on some foreign ownership of housing, had survived the negotiations with Peters in recent weeks.  With New Zealand First we ve got a few more details to iron out,  Ardern said.  Our plan remains, with a few minor changes ... we re finalizing in the next 24 hours the detail.   The election  thrust the country into political limbo for almost a month with neither major party winning enough seats to form a majority and giving New Zealand First the balance of power.  New Zealand First and Labour also needed support from the progressive Green Party, which said it would strike a  confidence and supply  agreement, meaning it was officially outside government but would hold ministerial posts and vote on key pieces of legislation like the budget. Ardern said the parties would release their agreements early next week and an announcement on ministerial posts would come later in the week. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
New Zealand's 'first bloke' hooks into new role,"(Reuters) - New Zealand not only has its youngest female prime minister with the rise to power of center-left Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, but a renegade new  first bloke  who is a national celebrity in his own right.  Clarke Gayford, who hosts his own fishing television show, has already broken the mold of his predecessors, stepping in to defend his partner against  scaremongering old dinos  including one political rival who made a disparaging reference to Ardern and  lipstick on a pig . On Twitter, Gayford has thrown fishing buddy jokes to Winston Peters, the leader of the small nationalist party that decided Ardern s political fate and teased a nation that waited a month for an election result:  heading out of reception for a while..... things always seem to happen when I do this.  Gayford s social media followers are likely to surge following the decision this week of Peters  New Zealand First Party to throw its support behind 37-year-old Ardern and her Labour Party to form government.  Political analysts say the pair are a unique double act in a small country where the partners of the previous two female leaders, Helen Clark and Jenny Shipley, maintained a low profile.   This political power couple will be interesting to watch,  said Grant Duncan, associate professor at Massey University in Auckland.  They re both clearly very media savvy, both independent and have public profiles that were built up before they became a couple.   The couple met four years ago when Gayford, 39, went to complain to a member of parliament about the then National Party government s proposed changes to security legislation. He bumped into Ardern, a rising star of the Labour Party, they had coffee and were living together not long after.  Gayford s television show, Fish of the Day, sees him traveling around the Pacific, fishing and finding recipes for his catches.

"Amid South Korea freeze, China says cultural exchanges take the temperature","BEIJING (Reuters) - Cultural exchanges between countries need to consider the  temperature  of popular opinion and how people feel about each other, a senior Chinese official said on Friday, amid a freeze in cultural ties with South Korea over an anti-missile system. China has been angered by Seoul s decision to deploy the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, saying that its powerful radar harms China s own national security and will do nothing to lessen tensions with North Korea, which THAAD is supposed to defend against. Popular South Korean soap operas have been pulled from streaming sites, K-Pop singers have had concerts canceled and there has been a dramatic drop in Chinese tourists to South Korea. China has not officially linked the moves to the THAAD tensions, but has said relations need to have a  basis in popular opinion . Asked about the prospects for cultural exchanges with South Korea amid the THAAD dispute, deputy media regulator Zhang Hongsen said cultural exchanges were not an  ordinary exchange of goods .  Cultural exchanges relate to where the popular will inclines and to emotional choices,  he said, speaking on the sidelines of a Communist Party Congress.  So what we say is that culture exchanges are an exchange of temperatures, and this temperature comes from popular feeling and emotion,  added Zhang, who is a Vice Minister of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.  When popular sentiments and emotions align, cultural exchanges and cooperation can certainly develop in a positive direction,  he said, without elaborating. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Russian warships dock in Philippines as Manila cultivates new ties,"MANILA (Reuters) - Three Russian warships, including two anti-submarine vessels, docked in Manila on Friday to unload what navy officials said was weaponry and military vehicles donated to the Philippines as part of a new defense relationship. It was the third port visit this year by Russian warships as part of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte s moves to engage closely with Moscow, an arch-rival of Manila s former colonial master and closest defense ally, the United States. The load included 5,000 assault rifles, a million rounds of ammunition and 20 army trucks, Russian and Filipino navy officials said.   We would do our best to make this port call a significant contribution indicating friendly ties and relations between two nations in the interest of security and stability in this region,  said Eduard Mikhailov, deputy commander of Russia s Pacific Fleet flotilla. The visit was timed to coincide with the arrival next week of Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who is attending a regional defense meeting, and U.S. counterpart Jim Mattis, a Philippine navy spokesman said. Russia and the Philippines are expected to sign a security deal on military logistics next week. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
North Korea warns states: Don't join any U.S. action and you're safe,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea warned countries at the United Nations on Monday in a statement: don t join the United States in military action against the Asian state and you will be safe from retaliation. The caution was contained in a copy of North Korean Deputy U.N. Ambassador Kim In Ryong s prepared remarks for a discussion on nuclear weapons by a U.N. General Assembly committee. However, Kim did not read that section out loud.  As long as one does not take part in the U.S. military actions against the DPRK (North Korea), we have no intention to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any other country,  according to Kim s prepared remarks.  The entire U.S. mainland is within our firing range and if the U.S. dares to invade our sacred territory even an inch it will not escape our severe punishment in any part of the globe,  the statement read. Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs since 2006. North Korean Deputy U.N. Ambassador Kim did tell the U.N. General Assembly committee on Monday:  Unless the hostile policy and the nuclear threat of the U.S. is thoroughly eradicated, we will never put our nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets on the negotiation table under any circumstance.

Australia's second largest state edges towards permitting euthanasia,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The parliament of Australia s second largest state passed legislation on Friday to allow terminally ill patients to seek medical help to end their lives, a bill that is expected to act as a catalyst for the rest of the country to adopt similar laws. Any resident of Victoria state over 18, with a terminal illness and with less than 12 months to live can request a lethal dose of medication, the bill permits. Anyone that is too ill to administer the dosage can ask for a doctor to help. Many countries have legalized euthanasia or physician-assisted deaths, including Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and some states in the United States.  But Australia s federal government has opposed legalizing euthanasia even though the remote Northern Territory became the first jurisdiction in the world to do so in 1995.  The federal government enacted its own legislation to override the Northern Territory law in 1997 under rules allowed by the constitution. State law can not be overridden.  The passage of the bill in Victoria is expected to herald assisted death legislation in other Australian states.    It is a landmark moment. Other states are likely to follow. We have seen this in other jurisdictions and I expect once politicians see how the system works, they will adopt similar models,  said Ben White, director of the Australian Centre for Health Law Research at Queensland University of Technology. The issue has divided lawmakers and medicinal professionals. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews introduced the bill following his father s death from cancer in 2016. An opponent of the legalization, Michael Gannon, president of the Australian Medical Association, which represents medical practitioners, said state law should not change because of the death of Andrews  father. He later apologized for the comment. Members of the state assembly debated the emotive bill through the night in a 26-hour session that ended with approval by 47 votes to 37. The legislation needs the approval of Victoria s senate, though analysts expect it to pass into law. The legislation will not come into effect for 18 months to allow time to properly implement the assisted dying scheme.   ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
Singapore PM Lee says ready to step down in couple of years; no successor picked yet,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he was ready to step down in a couple of years time and his successor is likely already in the cabinet but a clear choice has yet to emerge In an interview with CNBC released on Friday, Lee, 65, the son of Singapore s founding father Lee Kuan Yew, said a new election could be called any time before 2021, when the current five-year parliamentary term ends.  I am ready,  said Lee, when asked if he was prepared to step down in the next couple of years. But he said he needed to make sure there was a successor ready to take over, adding:  there are people in the wings. The question is, who it will be and that will need to be decided.   I think it s very likely that he would be in the cabinet already but which one, well that would take a while to, to account,  Lee said when asked he was close to finding a successor. Lee was speaking ahead of a visit to the United States starting Sunday - including a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. Local media and analysts say Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat and Chan Chun Sing, a former army chief and a minister in the prime minister s office, are among potential successors. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam could be a candidate, although he has repeatedly said he does not want the job and he would be a surprise choice because he is a member of the minority ethnic Indian community. Singapore s leader since independence has always been a member of the majority Chinese community. Questions about succession in the wealthy Southeast Asian city state - which has been governed by the People s Action Party since independence in 1965 - came into focus when Lee, who has twice survived cancer, took ill during a televised speech last year and stumbled at a podium.  Doctors subsequently said there were no serious concerns. Lee Kuan Yew s successor, Goh Chok Tong, was identified at least five years in advance while the current leader, who first entered politics in 1984, was also groomed for the position long before he took office in 2004. [nL8N1B30B4] Prime Minister Lee said he was saddened by a feud with his siblings which played out in the public earlier this year over the fate of Lee Kuan Yew s family home. [nL3N1JV06P]  The matter is in abeyance. I m not sure if it s solved,  Lee said in the CNBC interview, adding he and his siblings had not recently communicated. Lee Hsien Yang and sister Lee Wei Ling accused their elder brother of abusing state power to try to save the house as a historic monument in defiance of his father s wishes. [nL4N1KR04A] The prime minister called for an extraordinary special sitting of parliament in July and subsequently said that debate failed to find any substantiated evidence of abuse of power. He has said the government must decide what to do with the property.   Perhaps one day when emotions have subsided, some movement will be possible. These things take time,  Lee said.

"Typhoon bears down on Japan, will hinder voting in national election","TOKYO (Reuters) - Typhoon Lan with heavy rains and destructive winds is expected to hit southern Japan on Sunday when the nation holds a national election, forcing officials in Okinawa to stage voting a day early on some remote islands. The Category 1 typhoon, located east of the Philippines on Friday morning and moving north, is expected to gain strength as it comes some 200 km (125 miles) east of Japan s southern island of Okinawa by Sunday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.  It will likely rain very heavily in the Nansei island chain (in southern Japan), in the Pacific side of western and eastern Japan from the 21st to 23rd. There is a chance it will rain violently in some regions,  the agency said in a statement.          According to the Tropical Storm Risk web site, the typhoon will likely strengthen to category 3, but weaken again by the time it brushes past Tokyo on Monday. Local authorities in Okinawa have decided to move  the voting date to Saturday for some remote islands.             Tomoaki Iwai, political science professor at Nihon University, said the adverse weather is likely to hurt the standing of a new party led by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, the Party of Hope.   Voters with no party affiliation tend not to go and vote (under the bad weather). So, parties that are dependent on the general mood of the voters at a given time, like the Party of Hope, are set to suffer,  Iwai said. He said some supporters of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may opt not to brave the weather and vote as well, believing, based on recent media polls, the ruling party has got the election in the bag. The LDP-led coalition is on track to roughly match the two-thirds  super majority  it held in parliament s lower house before dissolution, helped by divisions in the opposition camp and jitters over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, media forecasts have said.

"Fire destroys landmark hotel in Myanmar's largest city, kills one","YANGON (Reuters) - One person was killed on Thursday in a massive fire that destroyed one of Yangon s best-known hotels, sending dark smoke billowing over the center of Myanmar s largest city and triggering an hours-long battle to put out the flames. It was not immediately clear what caused the fire, which broke out around 3:20 a.m. at the teak-and-stone Kandawgyi Palace Hotel overlooking a picturesque inner-city lake, authorities told Reuters. An unidentified body was found in a guest room and two people were injured, said Htay Lwin, a spokesman of hotel owner Htoo Group.   Authorities were investigating the cause of the fire and the cost of the damage was not immediately clear, he added.  The fire had been mostly extinguished by 7 a.m., and more than 140 guests were shifted to nearby hotels. Htoo Group is chaired by business tycoon Tay Za, who, until last year, was on the list of United States sanctions for his close links to Myanmar s former military regime. Myanmar s civilian-led government, helmed by Nobel laureate and former dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, is grappling with the aftermath of a harsh military crackdown that has driven out more than 500,000 of the country s Rohingya Muslim minority.

Japan's Emperor Akihito likely to abdicate at end-March 2019: Asahi,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Emperor Akihito is likely to abdicate at the end of March 2019 and Crown Prince Naruhito is expected to ascend the throne in April, the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in nearly two centuries, the Asahi newspaper reported on Friday. The government is in the final stage of formalizing the schedule, said the Asahi, citing several sources. In June, Japan s parliament passed a law allowing Emperor Akihito to abdicate and the government needs to hammer out the details including the timing.  Japan s top government spokesman denied the Asahi report.  We are not aware of the report and there is not such fact,  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference.  We will continue to discuss appropriately and will do our best to carry out the emperor s abdication smoothly,  he said. Akihito, 83, who has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, said in rare public remarks last year he feared age might make it hard for him to continue to fulfill his duties.  He will be succeeded by Naruhito, 57, and a new era will start from April 1, the Asahi reported. The abdication law, which applies only to Akihito and not to future emperors, included a resolution to debate letting female royals stay in the imperial family after marriage but did not touch on the controversial topic of allowing women to inherit. Asahi said the expected 2019 abdication schedule would minimize the impact on people in changing to a new imperial reign from the current Heisei Era, which started in 1989 after the death of Akihito s father Hirohito, according to the Asahi.  The Imperial Household Agency also wanted the transition to take place in spring 2019 as many ritual events are scheduled for the imperial family in autumn and winter, the report said. Akihito, the first Japanese emperor who was never considered divine, has worked for decades at home and abroad to soothe the wounds of World War Two which was fought in his father Hirohito s name.  In a written remarks of her 83rd birthday on Friday, Empress Michiko said that she thought this year her travels with Emperor Ahikito around Japan might be their last and have become deeply emotional.  The Empress also said she felt  an immeasurable sense of peace  that Akihito will be able to rest and spend quiet days after years of pursuing how the Emperor should be.

Merkel presses allies to cut funds for Turkey's EU bid,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European leaders agreed on Thursday to explore cuts in EU funds to Turkey that are linked to Ankara s stalled bid to join the bloc after German Chancellor Angela Merkel pressed for action in response to what she described as  unacceptable  Turkish behavior on human rights. While praising Turkey for taking in Syrian refugees, Merkel stuck with the tougher tone she adopted during her reelection campaign last month, although she stopped short of calling for an outright end to Ankara s decade-long push to join the bloc.  We asked the Commission to make recommendations on changing and reducing the pre-accession aid,  Merkel told reporters after the first day of an EU summit.  There is no majority for breaking off the talks immediately. On the other hand there is a great deal of scepticism about the current situation. I made the case tonight that we should seek dialogue with Turkey.  Earlier she said that the rule of law in Turkey was  moving in the wrong direction , in a reference to the large-scale purge that President Tayyip Erdogan has carried out following a failed coup attempt in July 2016. Other countries, including the Netherlands and Belgium, backed a diversion of the funds that EU candidate countries receive while they are in talks to join the bloc.  Everyone knows that those negotiations are de facto frozen, are de facto almost dead,  Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told a news conference. Launched in 2005 after decades of seeking the formal start of an EU membership bid, Ankara s membership negotiations were always sensitive for France and Germany because of Turkey s status as a large, mainly Muslim country. But the scope of Erdogan s response to last year s coup attempt, his detention of U.S. and European citizens including dual nationals, and his jibes at Germany and the Netherlands for what he has called  Nazi-like  behavior. Aside from money that the EU gives Turkey as part of its  2016 migration deal, Ankara is set to receive 4.4 billion euros from the EU between 2014 and 2020. Some northern countries say aid meant to help Turkey reform politically now makes no sense because Ankara has cracked down so dramatically after the failed coup. With 50,000 people jailed pending trial, including German-Turkish nationals, EU membership also looks more distant than ever, EU officials say. Turkey is set to receive almost 500 million euros next year for the EU s common budget and European governments are discussing how much to limit that while not hitting projects such as infrastructure and agriculture. The European Parliament has proposed reducing the transfer by 50 million euros next year, with another 30 million euros set aside for further cuts should the relationship with Turkey deteriorate even more. A vote is expected on Wednesday.  Providing Turkey money for political reforms does not make sense given the situation,  said Siegfried Muresan, a center-right EU lawmaker who is leading EU budget in the parliament. However, EU governments are divided, with Poland, Britain and Sweden maintaining their strong support for Turkey s EU membership and countries such as Austria demanding not just a freeze to accession funds but an end to membership talks.

Rohingya refugee children in Bangladesh in dire state: UNICEF,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Nearly 340,000 Rohingya children are living in squalid conditions in Bangladesh camps where they lack enough food, clean water and health care, the United Nations Children s Fund (UNICEF) said on Friday. Up to 12,000 more children join them every week, fleeing violence or hunger in Myanmar, often still traumatized by atrocities they witnessed, it said in a report  Outcast and Desperate . In all, almost 600,000 Rohingya refugees have left northern Rakhine state since Aug. 25 when the U.N. says the Myanmar army began a campaign of  ethnic cleansing  following insurgent attacks.  This isn t going to be a short-term, it isn t going to end anytime soon,  Simon Ingram, the report s author and a UNICEF official, told a news briefing.  So it is absolutely critical that the borders remain open and that protection for children is given and equally that children born in Bangladesh have their birth registered.  Most Rohingya are stateless in Myanmar and many fled without papers, he said, adding of the newborns in Bangladesh:  Without an identity they have no chance of ever assimilating into any society effectively.    Safe drinking water and toilets are in  desperately short supply  in the chaotic, teeming camps and settlements, Ingram said after spending two weeks in Cox s Bazar, Bangladesh.  In a sense it s no surprise that they must truly see this place as a hell on earth,  he said.  One in five Rohingya children under the age of five is estimated to be acutely malnourished, requiring medical attention, he said.   There is a very, very severe risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases, diarrhea and quite conceivably cholera in the longer-term,  he added. UNICEF is providing clean water and toilets, and has helped vaccinate children against measles and cholera, which can be deadly, he said.  The agency is seeking $76 million under a $434 million U.N. appeal for Rohingya refugees for six months, but is only 7 percent funded, he said, speaking ahead of a pledging conference in Geneva on Monday. U.N. agencies are still demanding access to northern Rakhine, where an unknown number of Rohingya remain despite U.N. reports that many villages and food stocks have been burned.  We repeat the call for the need for protection of all children in Rakhine state, this is an absolute fundamental requirement. The atrocities against children and civilians must end,  Ingram said.  We just must keep putting it on the record, we cannot keep silent.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1
EU leaders talk up Iran nuclear deal hoping to save it from Trump,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders on Thursday reaffirmed their full commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, hoping that the U.S. Congress would not let it collapse despite relentless criticism by President Donald Trump. But the bloc, reluctant to isolate itself completely from Washington, is also stepping up criticism of Iran s ballistic missile program and its role in what the West sees as fomenting instability in the Middle East. Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal, struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany after more than a decade of diplomacy.  We fully stay committed to the complete implementation by all sides of the Iranian nuclear deal. We see this as a key security interest for the European Union and the region,  said the bloc s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini. The EU leaders  joint statement, agreed after talks in Brussels on Thursday,  reaffirms full commitment to the Iran nuclear deal . The bloc has been stepping up efforts to save the deal, saying it was crucial to regional and global security, and it has appealed to the U.S. Congress not to let it fall. Trump has given Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for the scaling down of a program the West fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran denies.  The EU leaders also highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with Iran from any adverse effects should Washington reinstate the sanctions, officials said. Should Trump walk away from the deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Iran would  shred  it. The bloc sees the agreement as a chief international success of recent years, and fears tearing it apart would hurt its credibility as well as harming diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions around a nuclear stand-off with North Korea. In outlining his tougher stance, Trump said Tehran must also be held accountable for advancing its ballistic missile program and its regional political role.  We will defend the nuclear deal and stand by the nuclear deal and implement the nuclear deal. But we also don t want to be standing on a completely opposing side to the U.S.,  an EU official said.   If they withdraw, we would be left in a rather interesting company with China and Russia. So there may be an issue of separating the nuclear deal from the ballistic program and Iran s regional role, sending signals on the latter two.  Iran s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) said on Thursday the ballistic missile program would accelerate despite U.S. and EU pressure to suspend it, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. The EU, which has expressed  concerns related to ballistic missiles and increasing tensions  in the Middle East, has said these issues should be discussed without direct links to the nuclear deal.       They were never very fond of the nuclear deal in the first place but now the situation has changed a lot. Both many Democrats as well as some Republicans feel like they need to play a more active role on foreign policy to restrain the president,  the official said. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
Britain seeks new ways to detect explosives in airports,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain launched a fund on Friday to support new technology to screen hand-luggage in airports in a bid to detect concealed explosives without passengers having to remove electrical items from their bags. The Department for Transport said 3 million pounds  ($3.9 million) would be made available to support innovation in the detection of hidden explosives, as well as new methods to recognize when electrical items had been tampered with.  We need to embrace and encourage the talent from industry that will allow us to stay several steps ahead of those who wish us harm, security minister Ben Wallace said in a statement. Britain joined the United States in imposing a so-called  laptop ban  on certain flights from the Middle East earlier this year, restricting passengers from carrying electronic items in their hand luggage.   The restrictions have been lifted on some flights from Turkey and Tunisia following the introduction of new security measures, but remain in place elsewhere. The transport department said it would consider funding proposals that focused on screening at airport security areas, as well as portable technology which could be used at other points in a passenger s journey.

North Korea warns threats a 'big miscalculation' in letter to Australia lawmakers,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.  If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,  said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia s foreign ministry.  Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.  A spokeswoman for Australia s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine. Titled  Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,  the note said it was sent from North Korea s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them. DPRK stands for the Democratic People s Republic of Korea, North Korea s official name. Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to  totally destroy  North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North s leader Kim Jong Un a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. The letter calls for  countries loving independence, peace and justice  to discharge their duty and keep  sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.  At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an  unprecedented  communication.  It is not the way they usually publish their global messages. The collective strategy of imposing maximum diplomatic and economic pressure through sanctions on North Korea is working. This is a response to the pressure.  ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
"Canada finance minister says will adopt blind trust, divest assets","OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada s Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Thursday he will place his assets in a blind trust and divest all his stock in a publicly traded family business, amid opposition allegations that these holdings put him in a conflict of interest. Questions about the assets of Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell, have dogged the minister and led some to question whether he would be forced to resign. His plan to adopt a blind trust follow weeks of backlash over a government attempt to reform small business taxes, which have become a major stumbling block for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s two-year-old Liberal government. Morneau said he had initially intended to put his assets in a blind trust - as Trudeau has - but had changed his mind after consultations with the ethics watchdog. He said he had  naively  believed that following the advice of the ethics commissioner was a high enough standard.  What we ve seen over the last week is that I need to do more. As minister of finance, in this role, it s important to make sure people have absolute confidence,  he told a news conference, adding he has  about a million shares  in the company and would work with a trustee to divest his and his family s holdings. Shares of Morneau Shepell Inc fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday to C$20.63, shedding about C$21.6 million in market value.  Morneau was elected in 2015 when the left-leaning Liberals were vaulted to a surprise majority under Trudeau, becoming one of the many rookie ministers in Trudeau s cabinet. In a heated session of parliament after the news conference, opposition politicians said Morneau s 2016 legislation on pension reform increased the profits of Morneau Shepell.  The finance minister and his company, Morneau Shepell, have benefited from the minister s actions,  said Conservative member of parliament Maxime Bernier. Morneau said he had been pulled out of government meetings at least twice since becoming finance minister to guard against conflicts of interest between policy decisions and his company.  I don t know the total number of times, but I can remember at least two times being taken out of meetings because of that conflict-of-interest screen, I believe. Of course I don t know what happened in those meetings,  he said. Separately, Morneau said the government s autumn fiscal update will be released on Oct. 24. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
EU leaders seek greater reductions in Africa immigration,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to provide  stronger support  to Italy for its work in Libya and replenish their Africa fund to further curb immigration to Europe.  We have a real chance of closing the Central Mediterranean route,  chairman Donald Tusk said after 28 EU leaders meeting in Brussels discussed migration, stressing the need to lower the number of arrivals from Africa going through the Mediterranean to Italy. EU executive European Commission told the group they needed to immediately chip in an extra 225 million euros for migration-related projects in Africa due to run this year and early next.  If we do want to be as present as possible in Africa - mainly in the Northern part of Africa - we have to increase financial means,  Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said. Brussels has so far committed 2.9 billion euros to the so-called Africa Trust Fund, with another 234 million euros from EU states, according to the Commission. Brussels said 1.6 billion euros would be spent by the end of 2017 on Turkey. In 2016 the bloc promised 3 billion euros for Syrian refugees in exchange for Ankara shutting down the route traffickers and smugglers were using to get people to Greece.  Despite sour EU-Turkey relations on several issues, German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised Ankara for hosting refugees from Syria and said the bloc should pull together another 3 billion euros to that end.  We have promised 3 billion euros for the coming years in addition to the 3 billion that we have already committed. We need to deliver on this promise,  Merkel told reporters on arriving for the two-day EU leaders  summit in Brussels.   This money helps the refugees who are living under very difficult conditions. Once again, Turkey is doing a great job here,  she said. Since 2015, the bloc has helped Greece, Italy and Bulgaria with nearly 2 billion euros to manage immigration flows. It spent another 100 million euros on controlling migratory routes in the Western Balkans, according to figures provided by the bloc. It has been spending on more deportations and financing United Nations projects for refugees and migrants in Africa, and mulling a center in Libya to assess asylum requests there.  Despite criticism from rights groups that the EU is violating international humanitarian law by striving to curb immigration, the bloc has applauded itself for reducing arrivals by more than 70 percent in 2016 from the peak in 2015 when more than a million people entered in an uncontrolled flow. The influx of immigrants in 2015 caught the bloc by surprise, alarmed the EU s 500 million people and fueled support for anti-immigration, populist and nationalist groups. The bloc s asylum system broke down under the sheer numbers  and the cherished Schengen zone of control-free travel was strained as member states introduced emergency border checks. EU states have since sought to agree on how to change their asylum laws, with bitter disputes deepening east-west divides. Tusk said on Thursday the 28 EU leaders would discuss the issue again in December and were aiming for an agreement by mid-2018. Earlier this week, the European Parliament agreed its own stance on asylum reform, including an option to cut EU funds to states that refuse to host asylum-seekers reaching the bloc. It proposed moving away from the current rule mandating that the first country through which a person enters the EU must handle his or her asylum request, saying it puts too much burden on frontline states like Italy, Greece, Malta or Spain.  Southern frontline states want a scheme that would automatically lift people off their soil during periods of exceptionally high immigration and take them elsewhere in the EU.  Westerners like Germany and Sweden, which eventually receive most of the refugees, have said more of the burden must be shared and that solidarity was needed.  Eastern EU countries like Poland and Hungary have refused to admit anyone, saying doing so could compromise national security and affect the traditional composition of their populations.

UK's May appeals to EU leaders to signal movement in Brexit talks,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May called on EU leaders on Thursday to move forward with Brexit talks, underlining their shared support for free trade and promising to remain a strong partner on security. Hours before the European Union will rule that the Brexit talks have not made enough progress to move to a discussion of the two sides  future ties, May appealed to leaders over a dinner to signal that the negotiations will move forward.  We should be optimistic and ambitious about what we can achieve as we share the same set of fundamental beliefs in free trade, rigorous and fair competition, strong consumer rights and high regulatory standards,  she told the leaders, according to a British government official.  Alongside this I want to be very clear, the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe s security.  ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
Turkish police detain leading activist at airport: EU official,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police have detained prominent activist and businessman Osman Kavala at Istanbul s Ataturk Airport, Turkish media and a senior European parliamentarian said on Thursday. Kavala, whose Anadolu Kultur center says it campaigns for rights and cultural diversity including Kurdish issues, was taken to the city s counter-terrorism police department, the T24 news website cited his lawyer as saying. Istanbul police declined to comment and there was no immediate statement from the government.  Very disturbing news that Osman Kavala has been detained in Istanbul,  The European Parliament s rapporteur on Turkey, Kati Piri, wrote on Twitter. T24 said he was detained on Wednesday evening as he returned from a meeting in the southeastern city of Gaziantep after an order was issued for him to be detained for seven days. Police took computers from Anadolu Kultur s offices, it added. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Kavala s arrest was an example of a  very alarming trend  of detention of civil society leaders, human rights defenders, journalists, academics and activists in Turkey.  We have expressed to the Turkish government our concerns on many occasions about this trend ... It remains a major concern of ours,  she told reporters in Washington. France s foreign ministry said on Thursday it was worried by the arrest of Kavala, calling him  one of the most important and respected figures of the Turkish cultural scene and of civil society .   France like other European countries, regularly cooperate with Mr Kavala, who is a regular interlocutor to our embassy. (We) will be very attentive to developments in this case,  foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne told reporters. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
"Maltese journalist probably killed by remotely detonated bomb, government says","VALLETTA (Reuters) - Police believe a bomb that killed a prominent journalist in Malta was attached beneath her car and triggered remotely, a government spokeswoman said on Thursday, giving the first details of the investigation. Daphne Caruana Galizia, a renowned blogger and fierce critic of the government, died on Monday in a blast that wrecked her  car as she was leaving her house, throwing debris and body parts into a nearby field. The murder shocked the Mediterranean island, the smallest nation in the European Union, and Prime Minister Joseph Muscat on Wednesday promised a reward to anyone who came forward with information about the killing. However, Caruana Galizia s three grown-up sons dismissed the offer, and called instead for Muscat to resign, saying he should take political responsibility for the first such murder of a journalist in Malta since the island won independence in 1964. Muscat has ruled out quitting and flew to Brussels on Thursday for an EU summit, where his spokeswoman said investigators were making some progress.   Emerging evidences make us think that the bomb was placed under the car and was set off with a remote trigger,  she said, adding that foreign experts would be called on to help identify the mobile phone which was used to detonate the bomb.  In a news conference in Valletta, police commissioner Lawrence Cutajar denied British police would join Dutch forensic experts and a team from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in helping with the case. Muscat s spokeswoman earlier said British officers would be involved. Cutajar said no arrests had made so far and added it was too soon to discuss possible motives, telling reporters it would take weeks to collect all the evidence. He also could not confirm reports from a Maltese police source that Semtex explosives were believed to have been used in the killing. The island has seen a number of small bomb attacks in recent years tied to gangland criminals, but the explosives used were relatively rudimentary and did not have the same power as the device that targeted Caruana Galizia. The 53-year-old journalist used her widely read blog to lambast Muscat, his wife and some of his closest advisers, accusing them of setting up off-shore accounts to hide ill-gotten gain. They denied the charges and Muscat was suing Caruana Galizia for libel at the time of her death.  The police may or may not find out who ordered the assassination of our mother but as long as those who led the country to this point remain in place, none of it will matter,  her three sons, Matthew, Andrew and Paul, wrote on Facebook.  That added that the only way forward was for Muscat to stand aside:  Resign for watching over the birth of a society dominated by fear, mistrust, crime and corruption.  As he arrived at the EU summit in Brussels, Muscat denied that he had created a  mafia state  in Malta, which is home to a large financial services sector and the continental hub for the flourishing online gaming industry.   Definitely not,  Muscat said. The European Parliament said it would hold a debate next week on the protection of journalists and media freedom in Malta, where the government enjoys sweeping powers over the judiciary and the police.  Malta is a Mecca for money launderers and tax avoiders,  Greens EU legislator Sven Giegold said. The prime minister says the financial services sector is as transparent and compliant as in any other European jurisdiction.  ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
EU leaders urge full inquiry into Malta journalist murder,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders called on Malta on Thursday to carry out a full investigation with international help over the killing of the country s best-known journalist, and the EU parliament agreed to hold a debate on media freedom on the island. Malta s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has already called in foreign investigators to help look into the car bomb that killed Daphne Caruana Galizia, who wrote about widespread breaches of the rule of law and corruption on the island. Malta is the smallest EU country but is home to a disproportionately large financial services sector and is the continental hub for the flourishing online gaming industry.  Muscat, who himself had sued Caruana Galizia after she accused him and his wife of wrongdoing, promised a thorough investigation of the killing.  We will not exclude any sort of path, any sort of measure to make sure we get to the bottom of it,  Muscat told reporters arriving to the EU summit in Brussels. The president of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani said he raised the issue in a meeting with EU leaders.  I called for an international investigation to fully clarify an event of unprecedented gravity,  he said, adding that the leaders broadly shared the view. During the meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed an international investigation, EU officials said. Diplomats said that France, Spain and Portugal had also stressed the need for involvement of foreign investigators. Before the meeting Muscat said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Dutch investigators would help in the case and other security forces, including London s Scotland Yard, could join. The chief of the Maltese police later denied possible involvement of the British police. Political leaders of the EU Parliament agreed to hold a debate next Tuesday on  protection of journalists and the defense of media freedom in Malta , according to a draft agenda adopted on Thursday.   Malta is a Mecca for money launderers and tax avoiders,  Greens EU legislator Sven Giegold said.  Malta s center of power suffers from a culture of impunity unlike hardly any other country in the EU. Europe must no longer turn a blind eye to the way in which the rule of law is flouted in Malta.  Muscat has rejected criticism that he has allowed wealthy foreigners to hold great sway over Malta, and says the financial services sector is as transparent and compliant as any other European jurisdiction.

Spain to suspend Catalonia's autonomy in response to independence threat,"MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spain s central government said on Thursday it would suspend Catalonia s autonomy and impose direct rule after the region s leader threatened to go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if Madrid refused to hold talks. In an act unprecedented since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on Saturday that could trigger the move. The Socialist opposition said it backed the government but suggested the measures should be limited in scope and time. Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, ignoring a 10 a.m. deadline to drop his secession campaign, wrote a letter to Rajoy threatening a formal declaration of independence. The war of words increased uncertainty over a standoff that has raised fears of social unrest, cut growth prospects for the euro zone s fourth-largest economy and rattled the euro.  If the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression, the Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence,  Puigdemont said. Catalonia, which has a distinctive culture and language, triggered Spain s biggest political crisis for decades with a secession bid it put to a referendum on Oct 1. Only 43 percent of voters participated but those who did voted overwhelmingly to secede, while opponents of secession mostly stayed home. Spanish courts have ruled the referendum illegal, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed. The European Union declined to help mediate, saying the crisis was for Madrid and Barcelona to resolve.  Member states are clear there is no room or space for any kind of mediation,  European Council President Donald Tusk told a news conference during an EU leaders summit in Brussels. The regional authorities have not made clear how and when a declaration of independence would take place and whether it would be endorsed by the regional assembly. Some pro-independence lawmakers have said they want to hold a vote in the Catalan parliament to lend it a more solemn character. Rajoy plans to invoke Article 155 of the 1978 constitution, which allows taking control of a region if it breaks the law. A senior government source said the exact measures would be agreed on Saturday and probably voted through the upper house Senate on Oct. 30, giving the secessionists a few days of leeway to respond before Madrid takes control. The regional authorities could use that time to split unilaterally, call elections in the hope of strengthening their mandate, or back down, although this is seen as highly unlikely.  From the moment the measures are known, the regional government knows what s going to happen and has a period of time to act until 155 can be acted upon,  the source said. Spanish stocks, bonds and the euro all suffered in early trade, but recovered, a bounce some strategists attributed to a sense that Madrid had the upper hand in the standoff.  The terms of Article 155 are vague and could spur more wrangling with the restive region.  The government will use all the tools available to restore as soon as possible the law and the constitutional order, recover peaceful cohabitation between citizens and stop the economic damage that the legal uncertainty is creating,   government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said in a statement. Rajoy s team met members of the socialist party to coordinate their next steps. A spokesman for the Socialists said while they fully stood behind the government they would insist Article 155 is applied in the most proportionate way. Madrid s options range from closing down the regional parliament and expelling lawmakers, to a softer and more targeted approach, the government source said. Theoretically, the central administration could take control of the region s finances and police, and call a snap election. But some members of the Catalan government have already questioned this interpretation of the constitution, suggesting the stand-off could extend for at least several more days. Carles Riera, a lawmaker from the pro-independence CUP party whose 10 deputies are vital to Puigdemont s coalition, said dialogue with the Spanish state now looked impossible, and called on the leader to formalize a declaration of independence.  From our point of view, the sooner this happens the better,  Riera told Reuters in the Catalan capital Barcelona. Impatience is also setting in among residents of the port city. Merche, 55, who voted for secession in the referendum, said she was tired of the political to-and-fro.  People want a resolution. Go for one thing or the other, but leave people in peace to carry on with their routine and their work,  she said, rearranging lettuces on her market stall.  Puigdemont has already defied Rajoy once this week, when he ignored a first deadline to drop the independence campaign and instead called for talks. Rajoy says the Catalan government has repeatedly broken the law, including when it held the banned referendum and when it made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, only to suspend it seconds later.  Puigdemont says a violent police crackdown during the referendum and arrests of pro-independence leaders on charges of sedition show the Spanish state has become authoritarian.

Catalonia finds no friends among EU leaders,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders sought to minimize Spain s crisis with Catalonia on Thursday and avoid encouraging separatists across the bloc, describing Barcelona s secession bid as a domestic issue and declining a mediation role.  Leaders did not hold a discussion of Catalonia s bid to break away from Spain and judged they had nothing to gain by angering Madrid, diplomats said.  It is not on our agenda,  European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters during the EU summit.  All of us have our own emotions, opinions, assessments but formally speaking there is no space for an EU intervention.  The approach contrasted with EU strategies on almost every other major issue over the past decade, including Greece s financial crash and mass migration flows from Syria. On countless occasions, EU leaders have used late-night summits to press for a common decision or joint policy statement.  It s an internal Spanish matter,  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters, a position echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who held a private meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on the sidelines of the summit.   He (Macron) has complete confidence in Rajoy to resolve the situation,  a French diplomat told Reuters. Spain s government is set to suspend Catalonia s autonomy and impose direct rule after the region s leader threatened to go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if Madrid refused to hold talks. Rajoy kept a low profile at the summit while his fellow leaders held news conferences on Thursday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped there were solutions  on the grounds of the Spanish constitution.  Despite some disquiet over the way Rajoy handled a Catalan independence referendum on Oct. 1, which Madrid said was illegal and sent in police to disrupt voting, countries fear making any remarks that could embolden separatists at home. From Scotland to Flanders and Lombardy, the 2007-09 financial crisis, unemployment and migration have allowed separatists, anti-EU and populist parties to feed off discontent with political elites and reopen regional divisions.  As Britain negotiates its exit from the EU, few leaders want to wade into another highly complex negotiation bringing new economic uncertainty and legal disruption. Smaller EU countries such as Slovenia that emerged as sovereign states after the end of the Cold War are equally uncomfortable about inspiring secessionists across the bloc. They rely on Spain, a large euro zone economy, for investment. Even in Western Balkan countries aspiring to join the European Union, there is a reluctance to fuel calls for regional autonomy at home. Spain is one of five EU countries that has yet to recognize Kosovo s independence.  There is not much to gain from backing Barcelona and a lot to lose from angering Madrid,  said a senior EU diplomat at the EU summit. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1
Winnie Mandela 'in high spirits' after minor surgery: spokesman,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African anti-apartheid veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, ex-wife of the late President Nelson Mandela, is  in high spirits  after being admitted to hospital for minor surgery, her spokesman said on Thursday.  Victor Dlamini said in a statement the 81-year-old former first lady was admitted to hospital on Tuesday for minor surgery on her knee and doctors had decided to keep her in for the next two weeks as she recovers.  I visited her at the hospital this afternoon and she was in high spirits,  Dlamini said.  In our conversation (she) said that her health problems go back to the time when she was banished to Brandfort by the apartheid government and during this period her knee first gave her trouble.  Madikizela-Mandela spent several weeks in hospital last year for back surgery.   During her ex-husband s 27-year incarceration for his fight against apartheid, Madikizela-Mandela campaigned for his release and for the rights of black South Africans, undergoing detention, banishment and arrest.

Lebanon's parliament approves country's first budget since 2005,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s parliament on Thursday approved the first state budget in 12 years, a vital step towards reforming the fragile economy and preventing rising debt spinning out of control.  Successive governments have failed to pass annual budgets due to a string of political crises since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri.  (Passing the budget) is a fundamental step on the state s path to reinstating order in the public finances,  Minister of Finance Ali Hassan Khalil said after the vote.   Passing a budget was a priority for the government of Rafik s son, Saad al-Hariri, which took office in January. Hariri described the 2017 budget as an  historic achievement  and said his government would strive to return the country to financial and political health. A main obstacle to passing the 2017 and previous budgets has been demands from some politicians that an audit of extra-budgetary spending from previous years be carried out. But on Wednesday, parliament approved a law allowing the budget to be passed before such an audit is completed and giving the minister of finance up to a year to carry it out. The budget passed after three days of discussion by 61 votes for and four against. Eight members of parliament abstained.   Lebanon s economic growth has been battered by years of paralysis in government decision-making and six years of war in neighboring Syria. Growth slowed to just over 1 percent a year from an average of 8 percent before the Syrian war. Lebanon s debt has also risen strongly since the war began in 2011. Moody s says the debt-to-Gross Domestic Product ratio, which indicates a country s ability to pay back its debt, is the world s third highest and will reach almost 140 percent in 2018. Economists have said a budget was vital to reforming public finances, but that more needs to be done to improve growth and investor confidence in the country: reform the heavily subsidized electricity sector, boost tax collection and upgrade crumbling infrastructure.  The government will begin work on the 2018 budget next week, Hariri and Khalil said. Khalil said it will include a vision to develop the country economically and socially as well as  financial and reform measures to reduce the deficit and increase growth .

Erdogan critic held in Spain returns to Germany denouncing 'despotism',"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Author Dogan Akhanli flew back to Germany on Thursday after he was briefly detained in Spain at Turkey s request, and lambasted Ankara for launching a  failed manhunt . Turkey issued an Interpol warrant for the Turkish-German writer, a critic of President Tayyip Erdogan s government, in August. Akhanli was quickly released. But the move inflamed a row between Germany and Turkey, both NATO members. His lawyer at the time said the detention was part of a Turkish crackdown on dissidents. As Akhanli embraced loved ones at Duesseldorf airport, a man shouted at him in Turkish:  This country cannot save you . The author told reporters:  I would say Turkey s manhunt has failed, that might be why this man is so annoyed and feels the need to threaten me.  Denouncing  despotism  in Turkey, he said reports that prominent activist and businessman Osman Kavala was arrested on Wednesday in Istanbul showed that  if this country arrests even him, then really nobody is safe there.  Akhanli, detained in the 1980s and 1990s in Turkey for opposition activities, including running a leftist newspaper, fled Turkey in 1991 and has lived and worked in the German city of Cologne since 1995. Ties between Ankara and Berlin have been increasingly strained in the aftermath of last year s failed coup in Turkey as Turkish authorities sacked or suspended 150,000 people and detained more than 50,000, including other German nationals.
